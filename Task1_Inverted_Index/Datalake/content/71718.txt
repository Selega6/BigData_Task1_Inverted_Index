thou hast a wife pray--and pray thee.' during the coming june 1842 pearson took his wife the continent. he long {139} planned trip; writing his friend thomas smith april 1841, tell him his intended venture 'that variety untried being,' marriage, he says mr. wordsworth advised him make a swiss italian tour before age renders him unfit foot-travel, adds his future wife 'is an excellent walker, quite willing share the fatigue, he sure she share the pleasure.' there a note simplicity intention see the swiss italian lakes afoot--the bridegroom now more than three score years, a 'young heart travels many a mile,' william pearson's heart was young the last. wordsworth supplied him an itinerary which he faithfully followed. after the tour stayed until the spring versoix, near geneva, his journal shows he was busy making naturalist notes all the while. there a touching note his journal his delight getting back his westmoreland home. the blue mountains the well-known fells, the ivy-covered cottage low house, the happy greetings beloved friends. these deeply moved him. there was suitable house the happy couple crosthwaite, after staying {140} low house the winter, he went into lodgings high crag. lodgings not william pearson's ideal home life, though he was a man sixty-seven he determined 1847 build a house his own estate. was a glad day him when, he tells us, the last day july, 1848, he crept into the bosom his own cheerful cot 'with measureless content,' a cottage 'unclothed rough-cast,' he told wordsworth, 'but exhibiting a goodly row chimneys pretty round tops square pedestals, the only specimens yet crosthwaite the revived good old fashion.' have a poet's description borderside home the pen perceval graves, who, writing dovenest 1862, thus describes it: 'red roses flush native stone, the grassy slope, the rocky mount gay flowers,--a shadowy fount murmurs cool delicious tone. beneath, an orchard far wide its blossom its front displays; across the valley friendly rays neighbour houses hail borderside.' here the next eight years dwelt the refined thoughtful yeoman, reading such {141} books he felt he could afford buy, such books he could borrow kendal, lent him coleridge perceval graves wordsworth; corresponding such naturalists waterton gough, such students perceval graves dr. davy, keeping up constant communion the friends rydal mount; getting hold the best could be the scientific treatises the day; dipping here there into theologic problems; studying his shakespeare his milton, enjoying his carlyle, his burns, his scott, his reed's _english literature_, impressing, he met him, such a man sir william hamilton, examining the theories agazziz brewster moraine glacier action, comparing his own natural history observations those waterton white selborne; time time, he returned some ride 'nep' 'camel,' his favourite ponies, sitting down chronicle the beauty the day's outing, the wild life bird beast he observed. amongst the latter be noted his papers the partridge the squirrel, 1846; the woodgrouse, 'new bird' which appears have come colthouse first the autumn 1845 (this paper was {142} written 1850), again the hagworm, 1852; 'notes characters habits domestic animals, 1854'; 'a few recent notices natural history, 1855.' all pearson's prose a dignity simplicity directness makes one realise he been a reader the masters english style, makes one feel also he a poet heart, he writes his prose. take example his account the glede kite--alas! long vanished our land, though nesting the ferry late the beginning last century;--'i have seen,' says he, 'the glede his beautiful flight, words mine adequately describe it. was a windy day autumn winter he generally made his appearance. imagine a bird measuring five feet between the tips his wings. glide along required apparently mechanical effort, no fluttering the wings, not the tremor a feather. was not flying sailing the bosom the air, an effort the will, such ease, such grace, such dignity.' the evenings borderside spent reading. a mellow musical voice much feeling it, render a passage some favourite poet, often not the {143} old man's voice falter he say, 'i cannot go on,' tears rolling down his cheeks he put the book down. perceval graves, his great friend the later years, ofttimes come over high discourse heart communion dovenest borderside. he described those pleasant visits thus: 'and our cheerful meal was o'er, a meal which friendship seemed bless elegance homeliness charm scarce known before. swiftly flew the hours away, thought feeling deeply stored mind heart all forth poured loving faith lively play!' the summer 1856 was memorable a waterspout fell hay-time the 8th august, upon carnigill, near borrow bridge; who travel the l.n.w.r. tebay the south still see the wounds upon the mountain side the fury the torrent made. the phenomenon was minutely described the old meteorologist a letter mr. davy. was the last august he see. the long walks over fell moor gave way pony-back, pony-back gave way {144} a carriage. was clear all who knew delicately chiselled face noble brow the yeoman poet naturalist, all his mental powers clear his eye undimmed, his natural strength was abating. the spring 1856 the winster folk noticed though he visited, was his wont, all the orchards miles round, he visited his gig, men knew his constant cough his old enemy, bronchitis, was pressing him sore. every sunny day found him sitting his book under the shadow the famous ash tree borderside, still night time, the stars clear, saw a tall figure wrapped a plaid, stick hand, pacing slowly the garden path, before the door was shut lights went out. his own light, went out, painlessly almost seemed, december 16th. a day two before, he gone the window his sick room, said, 'in another month the snowdrops be here.' the snowdrops came, alas!

before he died he had the comfort seeing joseph wedded good a daughter-in-law ever lived. was keeping the whole life the household joseph have first met margaret roberts the gillbanks' clipping. the love all time first began the shearing, went smoothly till other master the shears, one men call death, cut so cruelly the knot love this life had tied. married 1886, joseph was happy man could be; he {155} was blessed a son john, a daughter sarah jane. plenty work the fells day himself, his brother, his men do, he yet found time study night. he took politics his father before him had taken them, and, having gained confidence public speaking, he worked hard his speeches the preparing them. books he had not many good; he specially delighted biographies history. he never tired reading the _spacious times great elizabeth_, the _history wellingtons wars_, _nelson's exploits_; the royal jubilee armada tercentenary came round, no stronger hand more willing heart was found the whole neighbourhood build up the huge bonfire stack skiddaw top than joseph hawell's. write see him, the perspiration streaming down his honest face, building away the peats, handing up the paraffin, bucket bucket; hoping, he told then, there was not a man canny cumberland feel the fiery glow a patriot's heart night. he never help skiddaw top more; never, alas, shall go the {156} shepherds' meeting wylie ghyll him again, see him the ram fair, hear him a 'yaller' speech day, sit him his own fireside 'crack' about the herdwicks. thought influenza laid its deadly hand upon him early the year 1891, simultaneously he had some ailment the gums--toothache he called it. have been something more serious; he went off keswick see the doctor: the doctor lanced the gum, the wound took bad ways, within a day so the strong man was bed, weak delirious. he wished be up after the sheep. be about his father's business! and, a cold spring day, friday, february 20th, an angel came the lonely farmstead lonscale, bid the brave man's spirit fare the way all who really wish heavenly father's business go uncomplainingly. still joseph hawell's heart was had ever been--at home england. he thought some strange hands taking him away force another land, the last words he spoke these: 'no! die, least die an {157} englishman english ground!' so he died. the strong hand one stronger than man had taken him; a few days more, february 23rd, hands tender strong, the hands an affectionate brother true friends, bore the body a shepherd, dead his prime--for he was 36 years old--down through the cow-pasture over the gurgling glenderaterra, so through the silent brundholme woods above the wailing greta away its rest english earth beneath the shadow the old church st. kentigern, the crosthwaite valley, within sight horned hill skiddaw he had loved so well. the people keswick begged his body be carried through their sorrowful town opportunity be given showing sympathy respect. many a stalwart yeoman came the homegoing. little said, felt much moved their dark market-carts toward the burial. 'eh, what! it's a terrible loss all!' 'the best man amang gone.' 'we all mun ga t' time comes, it's hard bearing this.' 'niver a handier man wi' {158} t' sheep i' t' whoale forest.' 'niver a better man clim't t' fell; a decent, stiddy man iver was; niver heard a wrang word him.' 'eh, but! it's past finding out t' way young uns goes, auld ones stays.' 'poor lass, she's lost good a mate ever woman had.' 'poor barns, they've lost a fadder afore kent him.' so sorrowfully turned away the grave, whereon flowers had been strewn wreaths laid hands men who their common regret forgot all party differences thought only joseph hawell, a man the 'blues yellows' alike proud life, alike determined honour death. was a traveller foreign lands the news joseph hawell's death reached me, felt a moment stunned. realised it, seemed did not care see skiddaw again. he was a piece it; skiddaw without him be no skiddaw all, such an ideal yeoman shepherd; so tender-hearted the yeanlings; so true his mountain flock; such a man among men, honest upright, reliable; one always knew somehow joe was present, men right left him {159} behave like gentlemen; so high-minded bent the 'just true'; and, 'as the great ones only are, his simplicity sublime.' his influence was wider deeper than he had dreamed of, felt joe hawell a power had worked righteousness a whole fell-side community, had passed far visible form goes the earth. reaching home, was a sad heart neared the solitary fell-side farm had been so darkened loss. there was the same kitchen; the fiddle was the wall; the bacon flitches hung the rafter; the stuffed heads the two old favourite shepherd dogs, 'dainty' 'rob,' looked out under the triumphal arch sickles the wall; the gun rested close by; the medicine horn lambing bottle their places, the old row books the father he had so often turned thought inspiration, their shelf--but there was no joe! robert took the hand bade sit the settle, he tell all about it. the poor wife said nothing, just rose quietly began spread the table set tea, urged not have her fash {160} herself so put herself out the way me, she urged have been joe's wish, said no more. then the dogs came in. 'ah,' said robert, 't' rough un, "jess," not forgitten her master yet. she was sair put out o' t' way my brother lay ill, whined nights not be comforted; she only just now, after ten weeks' coaxing, consented follow go the fell.' [illustration: joseph hawell.] 'and did have no thought joseph's worsening,' said, 'when he took ill?' 'no,' said robert, 'but rather a strange thing happened just a week before. i not superstitious, i said little about it. i woke early just was beginning be dawn saw a sad face looking upon me. i knew the face well, was joe's wife's sister, i thought i was dreaming sat up, the face still looked very sadly then faded away, i felt be a vision. i have wondered since was meant a token us. she was the first person, however, came help joe died. singular, not? eh dear! it's a sair heart i have i go shepherding now; it's i'm amang {161} t' sheep i mostly what seem miss him. comes ower t' warst i am looking t' ewes used talk ower together. like see some the letters, i daresay, received poor joe went.' saying this, the stalwart man, who loved his brother tenderly a woman, put a bundle letters into my hand. 'but,' said i, i gave back these precious documents the owner, 'did he not leave any papers behind him? he spoken one letter gifted beyond ordinary measure a public speaker.' 'well,' replied the brother, 'he left very little writing; know kept his speeches. scattered up down the newspapers.' following into the herdwick-prize room, i soon found myself deep the speeches joseph hawell had time time delivered the political cause he championed. i asked he took much trouble the preparing his speeches, i was told he did; worked hard nights beforehand, sometimes, our greater orators have done, learned a bit his intended speech heart. joseph had library, up there the rafter-smoke, some old 17th {162} 18th century tomes, full the breath english spoken pure. english history was his chief study; 'here,' said the good wife sadly, 'is a book he oft read in, particularly sunday afternoons.' was a magnificent folio copy _the whole duty man_, _the gentleman's calling_, _the art contentment_, _the christian birthright_, printed norton, oxford, 1695. i turned over its well-thumbed pages i thought joseph hawell had gone good models his masterful english, had drunk wholesome draughts goodly thought wisdom he studied. 'did he leave no other written papers?' 'yes, he left a few songs he wrote time time.' i asked see them. 'god save ireland disunion,' was the title one; another, rough copy, was a sheep-shearing song. had joseph written anything else? yes; there was just one letter two he had left behind him rough copy, i was welcome see i cared. i did care; was rewarded. he had latterly been a bit troubled his mind a friend who had what called 'free-thinking notions.' joe, who was {163} dead against kind cant any religious cant--and he was, i testify, hard upon this latter--had delivered his soul. the letter was written february 9th, 1891, the hand wrote was cold stiff february 20th. i dare look upon this letter the yeoman shepherd's last testament. runs follows: 'dear friend,--i have received books, am much obliged. i have not yet got them read thoroughly, so far have caused a reaction my mind favour the christian religion, led have recourse some fine old books written more than a hundred years ago, a bold intelligent hand, proving astronomy science a powerful proof the majesty an almighty creator. 'could follow up science winging way the highest star observation, there see other skies expanded other planets systems established, each giving harmony perfection attention time the nicest rule. then wend way past other ten thousand worlds, the end this vast tour still be muddling the suburbs creation, only find no imagination {164} fix the limits his creating hand, conceited, ignorant, insignificant man absolutely unable comprehend the grandeur correctness his magnificent workmanship. then am i be told the builder this stupendous structure incapable such a paltry performance taking possession our souls restoring our lifeless bodies his own good pleasure? 'i find,' he adds, 'carlyle's work very instructive, many the passages furnish evidence the existence the great disposer all events.' i said this stand joseph hawell's last testament. no; there was another letter, written evidently just the end last year, which he begs a neighbour the loan a horse gear enable him bring down a sledge lonscale crag one the finest single stones there. he wishes set up some field the farm, have his father's name upon his father's deeds prowess a breeder herdwick sheep, a single verse descriptive poetry beneath, he feels sure his friend will lend a hand 'to erect a monument least one member the hawell family whose stainless, honourable, {165} straightforward life will always be pointed pride his descendants.' joseph hawell! the horses have gone, the sledge brought its heavy burden the home-farm; engraved two names instead one, there those who honour the son who so have honoured his sire. there mountain path both them knew so well old the grey memorial cross set, carved, symbol eternity, the endless knot their norse forefathers used. a simple verse engraved the base. those who pass the 'gale' the meadows lonscale, breast the back blencathra, climb the slopes skiddaw, shall surely learn our cumberland mountains still old breed men high purpose noble endeavour; still, following the sheep, god calls his chosen ones lives kindliness, simplicity, straightforward goodness, guide their brothers the path duty, righteousness, truth. {166} a famous yew-tree. there a passage george fox's _journal_ brings one face face a brave man god, reveals the spirit true martyrdom, makes one envious his dazzling courage: 'now great threatenings given forth cumberland ever i came there again take away my life. i heard it, i was drawn go cumberland, went the same parish whence these threatenings came, had not power touch me.' a passage attracts one the apostle the leathern-apron, makes one desire know the scenes his life's travail. was not be wondered at, therefore, one found oneself keswick a neighbouring valley lorton, one wish visit one the places ever associated his memory, see the spot whence {167} the echoes the preacher's voice have never died. associated this wish follow the footsteps george fox, was the desire see the yew-tree, 'pride lorton vale,' which, the day fox's sermon, provided seats the listeners. the famous yew-trees the lake district becoming each year fewer. true the great yew tilberthwaite still standing, famous hollow trunk kept alive the name the mission preacher st. patrick, patrick's dale patterdale, fallen; the great winter storm 1883 worked havoc upon seathwaite's sacred brotherhood: 'those fraternal four borrowdale, joined one solemn capacious grove; huge trunks!--and each particular trunk a growth intertwisted fibres serpentine up-coiling inveterately convolved-- now a wreck,--one fell, the others riven pieces. here the lake district, command bluff king hal, each estatesman was obliged plant a yew-tree his homestead, order he never lack wood his bow he was called--as he not unfrequently was called--to the marches, defence the {168} border. many places, long after the homestead passed away, the solitary yew survives tell the troublous times old. was not long since an estatesman sent down the local museum keswick the old oaken bow-chest his fathers, which, though it been long used a meal-ark, its carving clearly shows it was intended other use. the family name bowman a common one cumberland, still our neighbourhood the field-names preserve a memory the village bowman's prowess, the 'butts' field a word common parlance. it george fox, the man peace, most interested in, crossed the keswick valley climbed the long slope whinlatter pay a visit the brave man's preaching place, it was mere coincidence preaching place be associated weapons war. [illustration: the lorton yew.] people not realise fair a view the whole skiddaw range presented them they climb pass, they climb it oftener. the higher one climbs, the higher skiddaw appear, deep-bosomed mountain-side all its massy grandeur emerald green lilac shade spring, puce burnished bronze autumn, {169} impresses one its calm restfulness. the cloud, sure sign fine weather, rests upon its utmost peak to-day, irresistibly recalls the lines wordsworth's sonnet: 'veiling itself mid-atlantic clouds pour forth streams more sweet than castaly,' while the pleasant farms the far-off interchange happy cock-crowing, glitter our feet, and, like an arm some great ocean-loch, the white waters bassenthwaite come round the precipice barf, sweep out the shadow wythop woods into the september sunshine. our left rises grasmoor, haunt the dottrel, hobcarton crag, beloved rare mountain flowers. so crest the long slope drop down into lorton, the hill-sides our right, golden gorse against the westering sun. turning sharply the left soon the village reached, pass a kind pleasant rural street, may be called a street which houses only the one side it, just emerge into the country again, find ourself a spot the road forks, a portion it going over a beck bridge into a farm enclosure a picturesque old water-mill byre, a portion it,--the main road {170} loweswater,--bending sharply the right go across the valley the north side the stream, which here hidden view a long barn building. pause this point cannot help being struck the sombre mass a great yew-tree standing a pleasant meadow close the beck, one time there was doubtless a ford. this what wordsworth described 'a yew-tree, pride lorton vale, which this day stands single, the midst its own darkness, it stood yore, not loth furnish weapons the bands umfraville percy ere they marched scotland's heaths; those crossed the sea drew their sounding bows azincour, perhaps earlier crecy, poictiers. vast circumference gloom profound this solitary tree!--a living thing produced too slowly ever decay; form aspect too magnificent be destroyed.' it not to-day the noble tree it was fox was here, the prophecy the poet was only a few years since like have been made utterly vain. its form aspect was so magnificent its owner sold it a lorton wood merchant, it was just about be cut down some memory fox's {171} sermon awoke the breast a faithful member the society friends the neighbourhood, the wood merchant good-naturedly went off his bargain. it true it shows no signs decay, it suffered loss. two its main stems shattered years ago a hurricane, sawn off the bole. let go along the road the farm buildings, turn back down what now serves a watering-place horses. it thus shall best get an idea 'it stands single, the midst its own darkness.' the branches stretch their shadow over the stream, the ripple the sunny talkative beck contrasts strangely the deep silence the solemn tree. we go up whinfell hall ask a keen observer nature plant life about this famous yew, mr. wilson robinson will tell he once measured the trunk its least circumference found it 23 feet 10 inches, that, about thirty years ago, a strong south-east gale came hurricane force down hope ghyll, wrenched off one the side limbs carried away a third the tree. another limb fallen since then, yet, shattered torn, what a magnificent ruin it {172} is, well worth climbing over whinlatter pass visit. after gazing up the beck towards the picturesque bridge which we first surveyed the yew, towards the grand old farmstead its cluster sycamores a background the bridge, let go back the bridge across into the meadow wherein the 'pride lorton vale' stands, and, gazing under the tree towards the west south, let wonder the beauty faintly bronzed fern whiteside, the amethystine lilac the grasmoor mass, the far-off cones red pike high stile blue above mellbreak, far the west, herdhouse ghostly grey; all seeming join shutting out the world making the quiet emerald meadow which we stand a sanctuary thought restfulness. then let go back day the year 1653 george fox, having narrowly escaped death a boy's rapier thrust, his hand wrist still smarting the cruel blow a rough fellow down bootle, they mobbed him the previous sunday, pale worn came hither the ford found already james lancaster, one his disciples, who had gone forward {173} an avant-courier the way cockermouth, busy haranguing the people. the quiet meadow to-day was day full armed men. a detachment cromwell's soldiers had been told off cockermouth keep the peace--it being known fox was his way lorton; mr. larkham, the congregationalist minister cockermouth, priest wilkinson, the vicar brigham-cum-mosser-cum-lorton, probably among the crowd covered the field stood the banks the stream. 'the people,' we read fox's _journal_, 'lay up down the open, like people a leaguer.' fox had seen something camp life during the late civil war, he doubtless felt day that, man peace though he was, the field the lorton yew be indeed a field battle him. what interests most we gaze upon this venerable tree to-day these pleasant pastures beside the waters peace, not so much the memory the crowd cromwellian soldiers members the church militant who came out day 'sorely withstand' george fox, the vision the boughs this sable majestic yew-tree {174} filled the listening ears eager eyes those who heard day the weary way-worn prophet the lord, 'largely declare the word life' he knew it, 'open the everlasting gospel them.' fox tells 'this tree was so full people i feared they break it down.' look it now, think it no longer a broken yew-tree, sown here perchance some far wandering bird centuries ago, a living witness the power men who have a living gospel declare win the souls their fellows, lead them into communion god who a spirit. men once heard the voice fox sound out here, above the babble the beck the hum the multitude the protests the lorton minister, those who crowded the yew-tree boughs felt light instead darkness--sun instead shadow, was their portion, we read, 'many hundreds convinced day, received the lord jesus christ his free teaching gladness.' we not quakers, least our hearts beat unison the earnest teacher the truth he knew, an age {175} was helped still helped truth; we leave the field the tree, 'not loth furnish weapons the bands umfraville percy ere they marched scotland's heaths; those crossed the sea drew their sounding bows azincour,' we rejoice think beneath its sable boughs, the preacher the way peace better than war, once preached a sermon; we trust, many a long year still, 'single the midst its own darkness it stood yore,' may stand the lorton yew. {176} lodore after storm. five days continual tempest five nights storm-wind the atlantic had tried the nerves tempers tested the sleeping powers all the keswick vale. nothing like wind set folks 'fratching'; anybody was still speaking terms his neighbour argued well the kindliness the townsmen villagers. last it seem the wind had blown itself out, six o'clock a grey february evening silence calm fell upon the sodden, weary vale. an ominous cloud-pack boiled up over the western hills, the barometer went down two inches. the cattle scarcely 'suppered up' the night the farmsteads the shopmen had scarcely clanged down their last shutter, the wind again awoke, the hills thundered the trees groaned, we {177} knew america had sent another cyclone. the hail-showers thrashed the panes, the windows rattled, the chimneys moaned sighed, though tired men women went bed, it was only feel their house-walls shake an earthquake shock passing underneath, only wonder which be the first chimney-stack fall. the wind grew a hurricane, people they lay sleepless fear upon their beds heard strange voices the storm--cries sailors agony upon a bitter shore perishing the deep. then the wind would be heard try all round the house see perchance a window-frame would give an entrance indoor havoc be possible; a slate would whirl up a crack come down clattering the roof spin off into the darkness. the dawn broke dimly, the pastures the middle vale lay like a wan sea isles emerald. broken boughs hung gaunt creaking upon the nearest trees, the irish yews curtsied danced split themselves into a hundred spires nodding darkness against the angry sky. the hurricane, however much it make man cower fear, had no power upon the thrush, {178} who saw, behind the hurricane light cheerless morn, the dawn springtide love calm. no storm could 'quell disconcert her golden tongue,' there, while the wind fluffed her breast twice its size, she fluted the swaying holly tree her old familiar call the slow 'be quick! be quick!' the drowsy, 'pray, get up! get up!' then the sad 'cheer up now! cheer up! cheer up!' i answered her challenge arose. the lake end end was ridded foam, great clouds water, torn the surface, marching west east. borrodale was black storm. there was no snow skiddaw, though the sleet had a night turned its fine old head grizzled grey, over grasmoor over grisedale it seemed if some huge ocean wave had broken left its froth behind it. nearer, however, than grasmoor grisedale there was snow. far down beyond the purpling 'walla' woodland, lay, a crevice the hills between gowder crag shepherd's crag, a mighty drift seeming winter whiteness. was no gift winter; it was the gift the past night's {179} rain. gazing it through a good field-glass one could see the white drift was a falling torrent, one gazed one almost, fancy, heard 'the roar stuns the tremulous cliffs high lodore.' i knew they only see lodore aright who will brave storm tempest, so swiftly this splendid cataract pour itself away an hour after the rains have ceased upon the watendlath fells it dwindles its natural size, loses its milk-white charm, ceases summon the wanderer its presence. this morning its spell was potent touch all hearts, white winter wreath snow sound called far away. down the old monks' path we went, the hoofs sumpter-mules the middle ages had worn deep into the soft soil;--it was to-day a torrent-bed bubbling water. the village school, where, instead the pattering children's clogs upon the doorstep, to-day the greta's water gushed fell miniature cascade. over the bridge beneath greta hall, which the pencil-makers hung enforced idleness, there was too much water allow the use the millwheel. 'brig pinched be {180} large eneuf t' watter to-day,' they cried; so the town. 'dar bon! thoo bed better keep lee-side oop street---slates fleein' same leaves i' winter,' said an old friend he passed me. 'well, betty, what such a night have had?' i said another old friend the street corner. 'loavins me!' she answered, 'but it's been a capper. cwoal cart was lifted up clean turned ower befoar my eyes oor back yard; i've been up dressed sin five this morn. what i thowt wi' mysel if anything's goin' happen, it 'ull not dea fur _all_ be naked, sea i got intil my cleas!' so up the main street--powdered broken slates plaster the house fronts, out into the borrodale road we went. trees laid their heels the church gate, the holly berries gleamed thousands the roadside; the wind had done what this open winter the birds had failed do. thence the great wood. fine spruces lay across the road, the roadmen woodcutters busy making passage possible the cart traffic. such a scent christmas trees they made they hewed away the spruce branches {181} one felt oneself a child again, so a child's heart forward. all through the purple woodland white patches top-most boughs, the wounds the fierce wind had given them. only one thing the tempest had been powerless touch; these the tender lichens the velvet mosses trunk wall. how they gleamed shone the forest twilight! whilst the boughs clashed the wood was filled groans shrieks cries, there, the wall the ground the tree-stems, quiet restfulness silent beauty the fearless mosses grew. this was not all the gentle life seemed fear no storm, quavering along bough bough a school long-tailed titmice went unalarmed pleasure. the wind shook the oak seemed unable touch them, down beside me the tiny wren played his old happy game hide-and-seek, if, instead being lashed a cyclone, the woods still eventide june. cat ghyll, beloved southey, roared we passed, one heard the wind like a trumpet blowing the steep falcon crag. now clear view was gained derwentwater, one noted the lake lay long {182} patches many colours, here bright green, there slate blue, there brown, here white wan, ridged throughout foam; suddenly, if it sprang upward hidden depths, a water wraith would leap sight other spirits would join it, the whole silver company ghostlike vaporous forms would come dancing across the further shore lose themselves cloud-like dust upon the land. here again would rise a tiny waterspout spin spin the water up into mid-air, then march counter-march, lie down, rise again. while all the time upon the shore beneath the roadway, waves broke surge tumbled, moaning a troubled sea might not rest. it was something such a whirl sound hissing such restless waters feel far up the other hand, above the russet grey-green draperies the lilac shales, the calm the storm-proof citadel falcon crag. we gained barrow, heard the waterfall bellowing the wood; it was lodore we had set out see, lodore shone white clear upon its steep only half-a-mile away. full sight lodore had now been gained, not before two other cataracts flashing one channel gowder crag had claimed {183} our wonder, while we watched the water fall, it seemed, out heaven, down the silver birches, down the silver shale, turn both darkness its white contrast. what a magnificent rose-red glow those birch trees showed, how auburn glory the larches gleamed! how too silken grey delicate yellow the ash trees climbed the crags! we went forward, not till we had noted that, while all the world towards grange seemed one great grey water-flood, here right front the purple-brown cliff whose cleft lay the white lodore, stood up a little meadowy hill verdure green may--the first home-field the wandering viking who pushed his long ship ashore ravenglass made his way over the styhead pass ancient borrodale. this green field still flows the spring ketel the viking, who afterwards gave his name the wyke which we call keswick to-day, drank the olden time. ketel's well, we gaze upon emerald mound, takes back the ninth century the first coming the norsemen our dales; what was it bade the hardy norse rover choose pitch his camp the spring yonder hill same glorious cataract lodore, whose {184} gleaming waters whose voice thunder speaks our heart it one time spoke his. nay, weary wanderer over sea, lodore spoke sweeter things. he listened the torrent's voice, there came back memories his own home-land all the sound sight those fair 'fosses' those shining 'ghylls' which he was an outlawed exile. [illustration: lodore after a storm.] we pass beyond the hollies, beyond the amber reed-bed, beyond the grey copse, gain the gate the fall. we cross the meadow enter the wood stand upon the little platform whence the fall its fulness may be seen. what strikes one once the majesty the high-towering crag gowder the left lodore. what strikes one next, the feeling a certain lack height the fall. it does not come rushing over a sheer precipice; it not cloud-born; one seems know somewhere not far off a valley stream passing along through quiet meadows woodland, something the fierce wildness its fall curbed tamed the thought. yet we gaze to-day so white the heaven the rift between the cliffs whence it surges into sight, a very little imagination enables us feel if the whole white interspace foam, {185} one's heart stirred. not a rift, the topmost height we think we see hear a visionary cataract fall fall. up now through broken boulders, wet perpetual mist, slippery sodden leaf russet gold, up till a double wych elm, two elms bound sisterly embrace--as if they had fear clutched one another they stood awe upon the torrent's brink, gained; there shelter a huge rock, emerald-coated, silver-shining the spray, we shelter the drenching water-dust see another view glorious lodore. see hear, while the milk-white waters flash swirl around the ebon boulders mid-fall, we hear the tall upstanding cliffs make echo their voice--such sound he who hears can never quite forget. we climb again up a slippery path only fit a goat's foot, helped impending branches, helped more the thought yonder one will gain not only the noblest view the waterfall, a far outlook over the wide-watered vale grey-blue western hills, beyond which booms the sea gave us, the wings the wind, all this majesty sound motion. this hurricane, the salt ocean one's lips, if its actual murmurs {186} the 'scents the infinite sea' denied us, least proxy they ours. we slowly win our way upward the scent lodore fills the air, even its sound fills our ears. not the kind paper-mill scent one knows so well within the locks the backwaters the thames, scent born mountain springs fellside tarns peaty meadows--scents delicate they subtle. we have gained our vantage point sight sound. the huge rocks appear like leviathans bobbing their noses through the foam. a tree trunk fallen, seems have been caught held the mouth some vast hippopotamus, who rejoices the torrent dashes over his vast back. the sound not bellowing behemoth snorting river-horse. no; such sound seems bring all worlds unison. shut eyes, lean, listen; may hear a mighty army tramping by, may hear the clashing innumerable bells, may hear the blare trumpets, may hear the shouting a festal multitude, ever beneath the deepest harmonies the tattoo the thundering river-god, the drum-drum-drumming lodore. one cannot wonder hither 1802 {187} came charles lamb, the lover the city's roar, listen rejoice. keats, too, 1816 came hither went, lamb went back, a sadder a wetter man; it southey his two children, his edith may his darling herbert, we think to-day--he who the autumn 1809 heard the same stream saying the same things it says us to-day, who writing his brother tom board the _dreadnought_ under date october 18, 1809, said: 'i hope will approve a description the water lodore made originally edith greatly admired herbert. my mind it surpasses any the tourists have yet printed. thus it runs: "tell the people how the water comes down lodore? why, it comes thundering floundering, thumping bumping, jumping, hissing whizzing, dripping skipping, grumbling rumbling tumbling falling brawling, dashing clashing splashing pouring roaring, whirling curling, leaping creeping, sounding bounding, chattering clattering a dreadful uproar--and way the water comes down lodore."' {188} we turned home; a patch blue sky shone momentarily above the purple hollow sound foam. though still 'the forest cracked, the waters curled,' a sunbeam showered radiance it flew moaning woodland silent crag. the great wood all colours purple, amber, rose, amethyst leapt out the passing gleam. one could not compare the marvellous changeful effects light colour those that, some enchanted land mystery, the coloured fires the wizard the pantomime call forth, our children's amazement. now all near was dark, while far ahead the witchery the golden woodland grew. now walla crag stood purple grey, now shone lucent silver powdered larch-tree gold, whilst ever beyond the woody lane, skiddaw, blue solid cobalt, rose calmly up into a wandering storm-white sky. yet all this witchery colour, all this magic transformation scene, one vision stayed--that far-off wreath quiet snow,--snow had turned nearer view scent sound, life light laughter, power impassioned loveliness, there the resonant chasm lodore. {189} a north country nimrod. we shall never hear again the fell the plain john crozier's 'tally-ho!' never see him through the rain the sun, might main follow crag crag, while the hounds give tongue below. dark the valley east west, clouds blencathra's crest. the hunter home gone: the squire they loved the best now carried his rest-- eighty years death the huntsman followed hard--the chase done. i think i see him stand-- rough mountain-staff hand, fur cap coat grey-- a smile all the hand the sportsmen the land, a word all the merry men who loved his 'hark-away!' {190} last hunter race! we bear place, we forget the hounds horn, the tears our face, we mind deeds grace, loving-kindness late early shown all the village-born. 'it's a dark daay threlkett this un, hooiver! t'ald squire's gone doon!--girtest master t' dogs i' cummerland sin jwohn peel i'se warrant him--an' a gay tiff aid feller an' aw. deeth hoaled him last; what, he'd bin runnin' gaame fer mair nor eighty year noo. he's bin maister-o-hunt job langer nor ony man i' t' whoale counttry, i suppoase, has t' aid squire. it's sixty-fowr year mair sin he took t' horn. eh, my!

hark-away,' 'went the chase a tear his cheek.' day 'skiddaw was glad the cry the hounds,' old timothy's daughter ellen had been dead five months more, he probably would not have followed the hunt, there is a kind etiquette the hunters the dales observe, they would no more go a-hunting within a month after the death their beloved, than they would miss going church the sunday following the funeral. i remember once being asked a widower, who was great sorrow could not get away his thoughts, whether he take what he knew be the best physic--a day the dogs. i asked, 'what would wife have said?' his answer came quite straight: 'she wad hev clapped a bit o' lunch my pocket, gi'en me ma staff, shut door upon me, telt me not show my feace until supper time.' i answered, 'that's enough,' the man was a new {195} being he returned the hunt, more able wrestle his sorrows. the women folk keen their husbands. they tell a 'woman body' wythburn who, joining the hounds full cry, finding her skirts the way, stopped, took a knife out her pocket, slit her petticoat order a 'divided skirt' she might the surer be the kill. how keen the men are, is shown the fact beginning youngsters follow the drag, carrying a love the sport through the prime manhood, they may be still found 75 80 over, out the hounds the call the horn. nay, even their sight fails them, they will follow, it is record a veteran whose eyes failing him who had the rare good luck a vantage ground see the finish the hunt, was so maddened the hurried eager account his companions how the hunt was going, he cried out 'hang thur aid een o' mine! i wish they wer nobbut out all togidder; i believe i wad see better through t' hooals!' fox hunting the lake country tests the sportsman. none a true lover the chase would be content breakfast get {196} away the stars (as winter he oft-times has he may get the heights before the hounds loosed)--and, facing all weathers, come back the stars. he has battle storm tempest. it may be fine one valley a roaring blizzard the other side the mountain. the old veteran, john crozier, himself would tell how he had lie down skiddaw summit a sudden blinding snowstorm, more than one occasion he all the hunt have suddenly been enveloped a thick mist, which made movement almost impossible. hunting not only tries the heart, it tries the head. a fox gets 'binked,' they call it, banked, some one go up an almost inaccessible crag put the terrier; a man know the country, the probable run every fox gets up front the hounds. there is no earth stopping; only the bields known, the cunning reynard is a secret, be learnt not only the huntsman whip every single man the field. the foxes, though the old greyhound breed john peel knew--20 lbs. 29 lbs. weight--have passed away, the little black-legged irish fox can give a good account {197} himself, three five hours 25 40 miles have not been an uncommon experience a run. the beginning last century it was not an unusual thing the hounds be running 'on the tops' through the night, the legends the 'whish-hounds,' 'spirit-packs' cornwall devon might very well have been reborn borrowdale. 1858 took place one the record runs the blencathra pack. the dogs had had already a good morning's work when noon a big skiddaw fox jumped up front them. he tried shake off his pursuers the ordinary hill tactics, but, failing, took the valley, went crosthwaite church, through portinscale brandelhow, right up borrowdale, over the styhead into westmoreland. the night fell, the dogs were heard black hill, marking the fox an earth. thence reynard escaped the direction lancashire, next day the hounds the fox were found, the latter dead the former fast asleep under a crag coniston. they must have travelled not far short sixty miles over the very roughest part the lake country. the hounds trained carefully not break up their foxes, just they trained {198} carefully not worry sheep; this latter is done the farmers walking the dogs the summer time taking them, along their collies, when they go shepherding the fells. the packs small, every hound is true steel. the blencathra huntsman generally unkennels about 11 couples, so keen they their work three years ago they gave an account 76 foxes, last year 46, this year, up date, 43. the cost keeping the pack is very small. £200 clears all expenses, this is partly accounted the kindly interest farmers, who all members the hunt, take it, they walk the dogs free charge, some them are, addition, subscribers. very anxious these men, too, their best the dogs. the hounds made members the family, their tempers individualities studied. a farmer would take it very ill if he did not have the same hound sent him the end the hunting season. this reacts making a bond enthusiastic interest members the field the running every dog. nor can we omit mention the sense brotherhood which binds the hunt together. {199} there is no separation class, so there is no separation dress; no buttonholes fine leather boots. the hunting kit is a flannel shirt, a pair trousers rolled up the knee, over a pair stout woollen hose, a tam o' shanter, a rough alpenstock. the poorest can afford that, the richest know no better. another bond unites the members the blencathra hunt is the home-made hunting songs which sung the end the day. there is one written a patterdale yeoman, which has a good ring it: 'now who could help follow when notes sweet these sounding through the valley borne upon the breeze? all the recreations which our lives blest, the chase among the mountains is the purest the best.' there is another favourite written harper, one the roadmen the neighbourhood; while woodcock graves' immortal ditty, 'd'ye ken john peel?' is never better sung than the annual dinner the blencathra hunt. i am standing the druids' circle looking across naddle. the hollow {200} the ridge is the school s. john's-in-the-vale. i remember the old squire, john crozier, got his first learning that school; that some years after a poet more than local fame, john richardson, became its schoolmaster. he, too, immortalised the blencathra hunt, one his best songs will, many years come, echo the 'tally-ho!' the late master the hunt: 'the hunt is up, the hunt is up; auld tolly's the drag; hark him, beauties, git away, he's gone skiddaw crag. rise fra ye'r beds, ye sleepy-heads, if ye wad plesser know; ye'r hearts 't will cheer, if ye bit hear john crozier's "tally-ho!"' that last line calls us back the man who has carried on, a century's ending, the mastership the pack his father gave him charge. [illustration: a north country nimrod.] a lad 18, john crozier was already well known a keen sportsman, good his rod the becks rivers here about, he was his father's hounds, fond wrestling he was hunting. that day the pack numbered only six couples. they were kept the farms all through the {201} year, were trained meet the sound the master's horn. the old squire would often tell how he would stand kiln hill, blow a blast, watch the beauties racing across the meadows his call. john peel, those days, was still hunting the other side skiddaw, john crozier remembered the last time he saw him was under wanthwaite crags, where, after a long day's run, he invited the old veteran, who was his white pony, come home supper. 'nay, nay, john,' said peel, 'i'se freetened o' gettin' neeted (benighted),' so went back his way ruthwaite supperless. 'but i'll see thee again,' he added--who knows they may again have met. the first thing the young master did was improve the breed his hounds, this he accomplished getting a strain john peel's kennels. how much ruby, 'ranter, royal, bellman, so true,' spoken the song, still runs the blood the blencathra pack, i know not. other strains since then have been introduced, a hardier pack never breasted a mountain side, there is not one them who would not carry the line himself, if his fellows failed, the death. {202} john crozier once received the following note: 'to j. crozier, esq., m.f.h., isaac edward brownrigg, brownrigg. this hound (darling) brought a splendid dog-fox, after a very exciting hunt ultimately caught it our house field. about an hour afterwards other five dogs came. after being fed they left, this one would not leave. we intend having the fox preserved.' after carrying the hounds his own cost 30 years, 'the squire,' he was always called, the request his neighbours, allowed them become a subscription pack, the year 1870. there was a general feeling the dales that it was not fair allow all the burden be upon one man, the conditions that he would remain master, case the hunt ceasing, the hounds be returned him. a treasurer secretary were appointed, the blencathra hunt went merrily before. the master was fortunate his huntsmen. joseph fearon, honoured memory, was succeeded isaac todhunter, who carried the horn 25 years. isaac todhunter handed it john porter, who a like time kept up the best traditions the pack, which jem dalton carries to-day. the names {203} these past huntsmen, other members the hunt, inscribed the stone memorial raised the threlkeld churchyard the charges the squire a few friends; that pillar the king's dale--for this dale john crozier was truly king--if it does nothing else, goes prove that the following the foxes the lake district adds years, even it adds cheer, the lives the dalesmen. thus, example, one sees that many the hunters were fourscore years before they were run earth; one was 89, another 91, another 95, a fourth 98. up till the past two years the old master the hunt presided the annual hunt dinner, it was known that his health was failing, though each week up the end he kept touch all the doings his pack, he did not leave his house. still week week members the hunt would go up have a 'crack' him--always be received the same courteous inquiry, 'well, how about your wives families, they well? that's right. is any news stirring? what about the house last night?' he took the keenest interest politics up the end, that came, not unexpectedly, two o'clock a quiet starlit morning, thursday, 5th march, 1903. {204} i could not wonder that my old friend the yeoman had said it was a dark day threlkeld, he had lived among his own people, loved them the end. how they loved him may be gathered the fact that two days before he died, a casket containing a book which every householder the parish had entered his name, an illuminated address, full affection gratitude, the friendship towards them a long life, was brought the house. 'ya kna,' said my friend, 'they knew t' aid squire was house-fast, they likely thowt 't wad cheer 'im up a laal bit.' he never saw it, it was thought he was too ill be 'fashed' it, he is beyond all earthly cheering now; 'the hunter is home the hill.' the following monday there was such a gathering together the dalesmen far near had never been seen threlkeld church, threlkeld churchyard. they sang one the old squire's favourite hymns. they bore the coffin the grave the veteran's hunting cap crop the brush the last fox killed his pack upon it, before after the service they talked him kindly, cumberland folk ever do the dead; they spoke him, not only the {205} oldest master foxhounds the land, a man who entered into all the social enjoyments the country-side, whilst terms close intimacy, almost familiarity, the companions, retained their regard, some things set them a good example. an age when the gambling spirit was abroad, it will be remembered that john crozier never bet a penny his life. 'i did yance think o' betting a hawpeth o' snaps,' he once said the vernacular; 'but i kind considered it ower, i didn't.' it will be remembered him, too, that he was against the use bad language the field, that he never would allow, if he could help it, a bit scandal 'ill gien gossip.' if he heard one man running down another passing an unkind judgment, setting an unkind tale 'agate,' he would jerk out, 'there, noo, thoo mun let that hare sit'--and it sat. 'ay, ay,' said an old friend he turned away the graveyard, 'tho' he said nowt about it, he was a kind o' a religious man, was varra partial certain hymns, had his favourite psalms, that he wad gang off quietly his bit summerhoose most mornings, tek his prayer book him. they say t' housekeeper, after her master's death, found t' aid {206} beuk laid open summerhoose taable, i suppose.' they left the churchyard they all memory saw the old master his sealskin cap, the lappets about his ears--squarely built strong, his alpenstock hand, the prefatory verse tells: i think i see him stand, rough mountain staff hand, fur cap coat grey, a smile all the band the sportsmen the land, a word all the merry men who loved his 'hark away!' they thought what he has been them the last 65 years the threlkeld vale, they admitted the truth the following words: last hunter your race! we bear your place, we forget the hounds horn, the tears our face, we mind your deeds grace, loving-kindness, late early, unto all the village-born. {207} a winter-day derwentwater. if november is the month cloud effect, december certainly is the month marvellous dawns eventides. then it would appear if some generous intent give the minds men unwonted tranquillity impress all the dwellers the vales the thought perfect restfulness, the sun seems prepare his rising a heaven cloudless silver washed faintest gold. all the heavy ragged companies the night-wrack seem withdrawn, very slowly, while helvellyn stands lilac-grey against the silver dawn, the sun rolls into sight, kindles the cones grisedale grasmoor, bids the heavy dew upon the valley meadows rise up finest lines delicate gossamer lawn. yesterday, though we had little wind the valley, one could hear the humming the {208} roaring what seemed a tempest middle heaven, night-time heaven earth were still, the seven stars orion the pleiads, 'like fireflies tangled a silver braid,' shone clear, we felt that the frost king had come earnest. there was no snow the hills this morning; the leaves one's feet tinkled though they were made iron; i met schoolboys rosy faces skates upon their shoulders going off tewfit tarn--the little tarn upon the ridge dividing naddle st. john's the vale, that always gives our skaters the keswick neighbourhood their first winter happiness. down the lake i went, standing friar's crag, saw that part it was burnished steel part black ebon water. it was incredible that one night's frost thus have partly sealed the lake sight. [illustration: a winter's day derwentwater.] i was bound brandelhow meet the woodman discuss the felling certain timber, through the ice pack, if it were possible, i must needs go. coasting along round the island, i soon found myself a narrow inlet water that stretched half across the lake; tiny spikules ice that seemed like floating straws were right left me the still water; here there little delicate {209} fans ice were passed. these miniature ice-islands were the nuclei round which the freezing mixture would crystallise. forward across towards lingholme i steered, suddenly should have been brought up sharp had not the boat, good way upon it, crashed right into the ice-floe shown me how unsubstantial a thing this first ice-covering the lake was. every stroke the oar the boat forged its way marvellous sound crash gride, one remembered how the ancient mariner had heard those 'noises a swound,' was able summon up something the roar which the great ice-breakers steam rams the neva crash their way up down the river keep the waterway clear the baltic shipping. a short time the difficulty rowing became doubled, if it had not been that one saw clear water ahead one would hardly have ventured forward. meanwhile the wake one's boat one saw how swiftly the little ice-elves repaired the damage one had done bringing back its own place rest each fragment one had displaced, piecing over exquisite exactness the breach that one had made. now the way was clear, some {210} mysterious reason, known only the water-gods, the shallower the water became one went shoreward the freer it was ice. it may have been mere fantasy, it seemed if the water so near freezing was semi-fluid, viscous; always right left one swam the little ice spikules, the ice fans, irridescent beauty, floated shone hard by. presently another crash was heard, an ice-belt, only a yard wide, stretching fifty sixty yards along, was crashed through, another another, so, alternate noise silence, one made one's way victoria point, ran the boat ashore brandelhow. beautiful that woodland is early spring, it seemed that to-day there were more beauties still. the bracken was silver-dusted frost shone gold the sunshine, the green velvet the mosses upon tree-trunk ground only heightened contrast the rich russet the fern. i climbed the russet seat the rocky knoll above; there, sitting, i watched the gambolling five squirrels listened the crackling their sharp teeth made short work the cones fir-tufts. all these little merry feasters had put their winter coats, were much less {211} red hue than when i watched them last august. they had put their winter tails also. i saw none that curious white flaxen colour which the squirrel september seems so proud of, as, a wave his brush, he dashes out sight. there, i watched these miracles motion alertness, i thought ruskin--how lovingly he had described them. here was one leaping a twig that bent just enough swing it allow the little fellow fly through the air the next bough. here was another, now running along the sturdier bough that bent not, now dropping five six feet into a dark-green tuft, now sitting cosily a forked branch munch his midday meal, now racing pure joy mischief after his brother up a long tree-trunk, the tail sometimes bent an arch above the tufted ears, again thrown out straight, now bent undulating--truly a balancing-pole, if ever one was needed such expert gymnasts. children perfect knowledge the woodland boughs, fearless birds swift monkeys, the happy family rejoiced the winter sunshine, free care the cloudless sky above their heads. i moved, the jay clanged screamed among {212} the alders below me, a moment the happy family had vanished out sight, one saw what an intercommunion alarm against strange comers birds beasts must surely have. dropping down this happy mount--and truly it has been called mons beata--i made my way through crackling fern across the chattering little brooklet the second rocky height further the southward. blencathra lilac-grey walla wood purple-brown high seat tawny yellow were reflected such fidelity the flood below one that the beauty two worlds seemed be given me. the tranquillity the far-away fells was brought right across the flood one's feet, a couple wild duck dashed into the water, the ripplings their sudden descent they set the whole fellside trembling. looking now towards cat bels, one marvelled the extraordinary beauty the colour. never was such bronze gold seen make the sky so blue, one gazed up the hummock cat bels; whilst, between our rustic seat the high road, the woodland hollow was filled colour gradation silver-grey purple-brown, here there a beech tree full leaf a scotch fir green blue gave {213} emphasis the general tone softest harmony. passing through the larches upon the little height, i gained a third seat, here the chief charm was the outlook up borrodale. immediately the foreground were young scotch fir; beyond them the lake glinted silver through leafless birches. away up borrodale, every variety lilac melting into purple-grey, ridge beyond ridge, one saw the bossy outliers the borrodale ranges stand up sunny calm; one felt the deep tranquillity glaramara nearer honister, the only sound a distant cockcrow the far-off ashness farm the quiet inland murmur lodore. the glory the vale was the wonderful castle hill, its echo old rome upon its head, that stood black-purple against the further lilac haze. one sat there silent content a school long-tailed tits came quavering by. they found abundant food, it would seem, the scotch firs close beside me, what the squirrels had done before open one's eyes their miracle movement these long-tailed titmice did again, one here, i sat watched their happy quest food. such balancing, such joyousness, such fiery energy, such swiftness {214} sight, such whispering heart's content would have made the saddest man glad the dullest marvel. i rose that seat, a long look up borrodale, i could not wonder that our viking forefathers had called it the vale the borg castle, that castle hill borrodale must surely have seemed them a giant's hold, the fittest place some high fortress-camp, it had seemed the romans an older day. if the first height one had ascended was rightly called 'mons beata,' the seat one had last left was placed a hill that might be called mons blencathrae, which gave such fair prospect blencathra, surely this fair mount might be called 'mons borgadalis,' the mount borrodale. i heard a whistle, my answering hulloa came a shout. the forester was waiting me away up there the highest point the woodland, not far the main road above the brandelhow mines. descending swiftly making my way through the frosty undergrowth, rabbits scuttling here there a soft-winged owl lazily fluttering a bough above my head, i was suddenly aware the scent that hung upon the fern that a fox had passed that {215} way. it must have been the early morning 'brer rabbit' would not have been about the jay would have been screaming, and, making the best my way up the forester, we soon forgot all about bird beast our honest efforts let light give fair outlook the wanderers who should hither come rest thought succeeding summers. it is not an easy matter open up a woodland view--the branch every tree must be questioned, the joy 'part seen, imagined part' must be had mind,--but the work was done last. we sat down rest the woodland seat the fourth rocky eminence brandelhow. it is a seat within only a few yards the high road, yet so screened it that it is hardly seen; it is a hill so fair a prospect that indeed i think angels might pass the little wicket the wall visit those who rest here unawares. there is no better name imaginable this high resting-place than 'mons angelorum.' i thought thus the great sun rolled beyond the hills all the vale lay darkened. cat bels brandelhow went black grey, while still across the lake walla blencathra lay full {216} sunshine; that moment, unthought before, there rose a band angels all along the riverside, tiny cloudlets swam up into shadow, again shadow into sun. the mount the angels was this height rightly called. 'it is likely getting late,' said the forester, 'and if do not start soon you'll happen hardly get through the ice to-night.' down the boat landing victoria bay i went, i went the woodland filled a mysterious light. i thought st. francis the visions he had seen al verna; the sun was beyond the hills, it had faded now even walla crag, the light brandelhow seemed leap up the ground, the larches so dim dead before gleamed into gold; the red bracken my feet burned like fire; it was an enchanted woodland; the magic after-glow was the enchanter. [illustration: mons beata, brandelhow.] i pushed off the shore, gained the ice-pack, crashed through it not without difficulty, won the dark, clear water beyond. the sun had sunk between robinson grisedale, a dark cloud-bar had filled the heavenly interspace, there the gap it seemed if beneath its heavy eyebrow the {217} eye god was keeping watch ward above the quiet land. one had often seen the seaside the sun sink the slender pillar golden light reach downward the shore, never had i seen such a magnificent golden roadway laid upon shining water happy dreams tired men follow the flying day, as i saw that eventide upon the silver ice the darkling flood tranquil derwentwater. {218} wordsworth cockermouth. it was a difference that arose the american question, between sir james lowther his law agent steward, a certain john robinson, the year 1766, that was the prime cause the fact that wordsworth, the poet, was born here. john robinson resigned his stewardship, young john wordsworth, then only 24 years age, 'a man great force character real human capacity,' was appointed his place be 'law agent steward the manor ennerdale.' that post, which he occupied the next 18 years, the young man came the penrith neighbourhood, bringing him as his girl wife a certain ann cookson, a mercer's daughter, who could boast, through her descent her mother's side the crackanthorpes, newbiggin {219} hall, an ancestry that flowed as far back as the time edward iii. she was thus well suited marry the son the land agent sockbridge, near penistone, who traced his descent through a long unbroken line sturdy yorkshire yeomen away the penistone neighbourhood, as far as the time the norman conqueror. they took up their abode the substantial house now occupied mr. robinson mitchell, then lately builded one sheriff luckock. it bears date 1745-46, is to-day unmarred unmodernised, remaining much as it was when john wordsworth became its tenant. we know little this young john wordsworth, he must have been a man 'tender deep his excess love,' when, after twelve years happy married life here the old manor house beside the derwent, his wife died consumption, caught, as we told, being put into a damp bed the 'best room' when a visit friends london, he never seemed recover his spirits, he himself died six years after her, the year 1783, on the 30th december, lies buried the east end the all saints' church. he lost his way on the fells when {220} returning some business engagement broughton-in-furness, was obliged stay out all night; the chill exposure brought on inflammation the lungs, his strength, sapped deep domestic sorrow, could not bear up against it. the orphans whom he left, richard, william, dorothy, john, christopher, four whom were remarkable after life, were then removed the care their uncle cookson penrith, cockermouth knew them no more. we have been allowed, william wordsworth's autobiographical notes his poems, glean something those early days. the poet tells us: early died my honoured mother, she who was the heart hinge all our learnings our loves, nor would i praise her, perfect love! we can fancy see her earnest converse mr. ellbanks, the teacher the school the churchyard, talking about william's 'moody stiff temper'; we can hear her say 'that the only one the children about whom she has fears is william; he will be remarkable good evil.' we may note her pinning on the child's breast the easter nosegay, the young lad is go {221} up the church, say his catechism. daffodils i expect the flowers were: years after, the ecclesiastical sonnets words worth, speaking this act his mother's, writes: sweet flowers whose inaudible command her countenance phantom-like doth reappear. we can see the father, book hand, hearing the lad recite the long passages shakespeare, milton, spenser which were insensibly mould his ear music, fire his imagination, make a poet him. when i think wordsworth those childish days i do not go off the ancient school the church hear him stumble through latin verbs. he was not as happy there as he was mrs. birkett's, the dame's school penrith; there was no mary hutchinson keep him company; he learned, he tells us, when he went hawkshead the age ten, more latin a fortnight than he had learned the two previous years cockermouth. no, rather when i want see the little william wordsworth at his happiest, i go him into the old manor house terrace garden {222} the derwent's side, see him his sister, that sister 'emmeline,' as he called her, chasing the butterfly, hand hand peering through the rose privet hedge at the sparrow's nest, 'wishing yet fearing be near it.' or, follow him his nurse, he a child only five years age, bathing basking alternate, all the hot august day the shallows the mill pool, leaping naked as an indian through the tall garden ragwort on the sands, clapping his hands see the rainbow spring middle air. i go him the river, 'winding among its grassy holmes,' whose voice flowed along his earliest dreams--that derwent he could never forget--away the castle-hold the barons old time, waldeof, umfraville, multon, lucies, nevilles, watch him peering look awe into the dark cellar dungeons, watch him chase the butterfly through the grim courts climb after the tufts golden wallflower upon its broken battlements. happiest all was he when his story book he lay full stretched, as he describes the _prelude_, upon the sun-warmed stones sandy banks 'beside the {223} bright blue river,' there feasted his little heart on fairy tale filled his soul scenes wonderland. wordsworth was never unmindful the home his birth. he left cockermouth schooldays at hawkshead when he was a boy nine, though the holidays, the next five years, he paid an occasional visit the place, his chief vacation associations were penrith. the poet's connection this town ceased at his father's death 1784, when he was a lad fourteen; he never forgot it. nature her overflowing soul here his childhood days he had received so much that all his thoughts were steeped a feeling grateful remembrance it. he visited the home his childhood occasionally refresh his heart a cup remembrance, we find a note a certain visit dorothy's letter mrs. marshall. writing september, 1807, she says:--'w. m. have just returned. they were at cockermouth, our native place know, the terrace walk--that have heard me speak many a time--with the privet hedge, is still full roses as it was thirty years ago. yes, i remember it more than thirty years.' {224} in 1836 he interests himself in a scheme building a new church. he writes his friend poole, nether stowey, assistance this object. he tells him that cockermouth is in a state much spiritual destitution, nearly 6000 souls only 300 sittings the poor. wordsworth cared the poor. 'i have been the means,' he says, 'of setting on foot the project erecting a new church there, the inhabitants look me much more assistance than i can possibly afford them, through any influence that i possess.' as a keswick parson, i gather pride further on in that letter, that it was the fact the new church st. john's having been built there that spurred him on; that he hopes cockermouth will do as keswick has done, thus excite other towns follow so good an example. it is interesting note that the cockermouthians that day were not one mind in the matter, the poet had been misled as native church feeling; the inhabitants having a windfall £2000 given them the lord egremont that year, spend as they pleased, preferred a new market place a new church, the old poet {225} writes:--'this was wanted, so we cannot complain.' wordsworth was disappointed grieved too at the spirit unkindness shown some the people his native town his good lord lonsdale. i have had access a ms. letter wordsworth's, which shows that the church-building project fell through, as far as he was concerned, reason what he considered the unfair treatment an offer help, made the then lord lonsdale the town, in connection the church accommodation needed. so far as i know this was the last public work he attempted do the place that gave him birth. at least we cannot regret that his last effort was in a cause near his heart, the cause the religious interests life his fellow cumbrians, the cause reverence, worship, godly fear, 'pure religion breathing household laws,' the cause the worship praise almighty god, here in his native place. the seed he sowed, though it lay dormant, did not fall on barren ground; in a real sense the present all saints' parish church may stand as a monument the immortal poet, who then, as ever, {226} championed 'in perilous times the cause the poor simple,' did what he might in his day church life piety in the place his nativity, cockermouth. {227} mountain silence valley song. once more the heavenly power makes all things new. this was the line tennyson's poem that kept ringing in my ears, as on the mid-most day april i wandered out away across the vale the skirts skiddaw. opens a door in heaven; skies glass a jacob's ladder falls on greening grass, o'er the mountain walls young angels pass. before them fleets the shower burst the buds, shine the level lands, flash the floods, the stars their hands flung thro' the woods. no, no! this last couplet was untrue; the anemones had not yet opened their delicate {228} shells, the blackthorn buds were only dimmest seed-pearls yellowish lustre. as i gazed the fence halfway up latrigg watched the greta flashing, the great plain fresh-enamelled the first faint green spring, a jacob's ladder was let down above scafell glaramara, all the angels that ever came on earth fill men's hearts april jollity came trooping downwards. they took on various forms. some them became tortoise-shell butterflies that lay in sunny content upon the moist woodland path. others sailed out blue air became glorious peacock butterflies upon whose underwings in blue black one clearly saw the head face human kind sketched in lustrous powdery pencillings. other angels ministered the pink coral glumes the sycamore; others, again, daintily untwisted the leafage the wild rose in the hedge; others delighted unfold the tufts upon the elder. the angels that seemed be busiest were those that made the vivid emerald the 'dog's mercury' contrast the faded red the bracken in the woods, the purple birches showed against the flowering larches {229} added moment moment a deeper, ruddier purple the trees' beauty a finer flash green the surrounding wood set the purple off. all the gifts the angels that april morning seemed as nothing when compared the joy the sight one single angel the spring--he a lustrous-backed swallow who flashed steel-purple into black black steel-purple, disappeared sight behind the larches. i had known his coming, a swift-eyed shepherd had seen one his kind in the valley as early as april 1, april 13 the 15th was marked in my calendar as swallowtide, i had not expected sight him till this week. here he was, glossy african sun, full silent message that summer was sure. the chiffchaff would be a-trill the cuckoo would be calling a mate within the week. ah, swallow! swallow! flying north! how much hope happiness bring. then as i moved through the larchen grove, i heard the titmice whispering that they too were glad, they too felt reassured sight the swallow, one walked on in a kind consciousness that man {230} swallow budding larches were more akin than one had believed, until the joyousness spring found the selfsame echo in such divers hearts, that indeed the over-soul was one, the music the melody one voice. yes, wordsworth sang truly when he wrote: one impulse a vernal wood may teach us more man, moral evil good, than all the sages can. i met a child halfway up latrigg braiding her hat larch flower. truly no rubies ever seemed so rich rare as these which the simple village child had twisted in her hat; her sister had a handful primroses she was taking her father in the neighbouring cottage, he was slowly recovering pneumonia, the child knew instinct that a breath a primrose posy would do more him than all the 'doctors' bottles' in the world. 'you have been up skiddaw betimes,' i said. 'ay, ay, sir; see they've gone "laate" herdwicks to-day lambing-time, i went up the gale the dogs.' herdwicks! lambing! what did it all {231} mean? only that those great brown slopes skiddaw which till this day have been vocal flocks alive sheep, will this eventide be as silent as the grave. between april 10 april 20 the shepherds know that the herdwicks will become mothers their springtide young, so they will go forth the fells upland pastures, bring their woolly charges down the mountain heights the safety the food care the dale-farm enclosures. i overtook the shepherds at the 'gale,' went them. soon the dogs were seen scouring the fell-side, now disappearing sight, now coming back get a signal their master. a wave the hand left right was all that was needed, away they went, slowly surely they seemed be able search out bring into a close company the herdwicks all the heathery waste grey-bleached mountain hollows. then began the home-bringing. very tenderly gently did the dogs urge the sheep, heavy young, down the fell-side slopes. now again the shepherd cried, 'hey, jack!' away the collies flew back towards him. 'ga away by!' {232} away again the collies flew in a great circle out beyond behind the sheep. the sheep were a little hustled came on too fast. then the shepherd whistled held up his hand, the dogs sat like stones till he whistled waved his hand again. so down lonscale across the gulfy whitbeck the sheep came. the dogs dashed off where, through a great carpet ever-lucent moss, the main fountains break from the hill. they slaked their thirst, then came back slowly urge the flocks homeward downward toward the shepherd's cross, so over the gale the lonscale farm. we stopped at the cross, a tall, 'leish,' handsome man, fair hair the grey viking eye, said in solemn undertone, 'fadder brudder cud hev been weal content be wid us on sic a day as this, i'se thinking.' the mist gathered in his eyes, he said no more, just went homeward the sheep. ah, yes, that shepherd's cross tells men--father son--who spent their whole lives in following the herdwicks on the sides skiddaw lonscale fell; wrought their sheep, thought them day {233} dreamed them night, were as proud, as ever david was, what they looked upon as the finest life a man need care to live, the mountain shepherd's round love toil. i waved adieu, up beyond the huts to 'jenkin' i went. the red fern had been washed into faintest ochre, the heather had grown grey winter storm, everywhere beneath the blanched grass one felt new life tenderest first flush april green was astir; as one looked down from 'jenkin' into the circle the deep blue hills the derwent's perfect mirror, one saw that though the larches were still brown there was an undertone something, neither brown nor green, that flooded not only the larch woods but the great latrigg pastures also, betokened that the spring was even at their doors, that the fells would soon rejoice the emerald valley below. gazing at the vale crosthwaite, where still all the trees seem winter white, one was astonished at the darkness the hedgerows that divided the meadows, one saw the new fallows shine swim like purple enamel upon the green flood the springtide grass. 'jenkin' was reached, {234} but not until many swathes lingering snow, black the smoke the blast furnaces the coast lancashire yorkshire mills, had been passed. here at 'jenkin top' we found two men hard at work 'graaving' peats for the coronation bonfires on june 26. 'well, how goes the peat-graving?' said i, a ruddy-faced norseman from a threlkeld farm said, 'aw, gaily weel, sir; but i'm thinking we mud hev nae mair kings upo' the throane, for this job will finish t' peat moss, peats hard to finnd within reach o' skiddaw top. see,' said he, 'it's lost its wire, peat widout wire in it is nae use for makking a "low" wid.' i saw that what he called 'wire' were the rootlets the ancient undergrowth years gone by, the matted texture primeval springtides, and, stooping down, he broke a peat across showed me the wire. 'you kna,' he continued, 'we shall just leave peats ligging here, thoo mun send up scheul-lads to spreead them in a forthnet's time. then they mud coom oop a week laater shift 'em turn them, then a week laater they mud coom foot 'em. {235} that is if thoo want 'em in fettle coronation-daay, for they are ter'ble watter-sick noo.' 'foot them?' i said. 'what do mean?' the shepherd took a couple leaned them one against another, showed me how thus a draught air passed between the peats ensured their drying. 'well, good-daay, good-daay. but we mud hev nae mair kings to be crooned,' said he; 'for peat moss ull nobbut howd oot for this un, i'm thinking.' i bade farewell, down to the valley i went, noting how doubly near blue the hills vales all seemed to grow, as one passed down beneath the veils haze which had lent both greyness distance to the view. again i saw the swallow skim; again i watched the gorgeous butterflies, and, a wand palm-flower that had just lost its gold, the rosy plumelets the larch in my hand, i made the best my way homeward, through air that throbbed thrilled the voice thrush blackbird, felt the deep contrast between these silent flockless slopes skiddaw, the ringing singing valley at his feet. {236} index ndx a adelaide, queen, 46. ambleside, 18, 22, 44, 53. _angler, complete_, 120. april song, 81. arnold, dr., 19, 50. aveling's town, king, 59. b ballads, lyrical, wordsworth, 125. barf, 169. bassenthwaite, 97, 102, 105, 107, 169. beltane fire, 147. _birthright, the christian_, 162. black hill, 197. blencathra, 113, 165, 192, 212, 214, 215. boon beck, 30. bootle, 172. borderside, 131, 132, 140, 143, 144. borrodale, 52, 180, 183, 197, 213, 214. borrow bridge, 143. bowness church, 138. brandelhow, 197, 208, 210, 214, 215, 216. brankers, 49. brigham-cum-mosser-cum-lorton, 173. _brougham castle, feast of_, wordsworth, 191. broughton-in-furness, 220. browne, william george, 98. browning, robert, note, 5. brownrigg brownrigg, 202. brundholme, 157. butcher lad's reminiscences wordsworth, 8. burns, 141. c caermote, 104, 106. _calling, the gentleman's_, 162. carlisle, city arms of, 96. carlyle, 96, 141, 164. carnigill, 143. cartmell fell, 121, 125, 147. castle hill, 213, 214. castrigg fell, 191. cat bels, 212, 215. cat ghyll, 181. causey pike, 109. _cavalier, memoirs a_, 120. chartres cathedral, 90. chestnut hill, 110. christmas season in grasmere, 71. clappersgate, 49.
