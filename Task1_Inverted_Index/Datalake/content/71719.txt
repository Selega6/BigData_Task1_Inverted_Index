which, believe me, gave universal joy. pleased make most respectful compliments lady. enemy willing desert, hardly doubted; variety sufficient reasons easily assigned. want success not among least considerable: add also want pay, want plunder. think situation enemy clearly demonstrates want political wisdom, knowledge war, fountain head. pass over succession other blunders committed, attempt long island present disposition, treatment soldiery monument folly. first, prevent foreign mercenaries deserting, kept back arrearages pay. secondly, prevent mutiny, silence murmurings, allowed plundering country intend conquer. here common sense alone informed them, listened dictates, irritating never subdue;

wish not encourage make more serious attempt: not proper remove stores place greater safety? somewhat alarmed accounts indians left villages; whence many conclude, hostile intentions: though much power, cannot entirely opinion. reasons supposing enemy not proceed philadelphia till beginning seem conclusive; equally well satisfied not open campaign sailing northward? probably seen some affidavits people who new-york, which sent convention excellency general. not go own express, not care risk any thing more subject, which treat more large next. time shortly prove truth mr. franklin’s conjecture, which derives great credit several accounts daily receive state europe. oblige communicating any further intelligence received subject;

not only because open campaign there earlier than go pennsylvania (as one case army move land, other water); because, command river, taking advantage southerly wind, power run up few hours; and, destroying boats along banks, render impossible general washington’s army cross till marched albany; thing almost impracticable season year, considering distance, badness roads. enable them, not only ravage all state, enter connecticut western side, disaffection people insure many friends. strained every nerve prepare reception, vested power general george clinton make whatever draughts think necessary militia: consequence which, every third man ordered drawn southern, every fifth man northern counties. not without apprehensions heavy draughts dreadfully felt, want necessary supplies army inhabitants, which hardly raised under such circumstances state: more remote evils yield pressures necessity. inclose you, direction convention, some resolutions lately passed, order render laws against spies, secret enemies, more effectual. pleased deliver them, respectful compliments, excellency general. happy hear arrival vessel arms france, supplies more necessary. flatter ourselves shortly power communicate more important intelligence quarter. are, great respect, sir, most obedient humble servants, wm. allison. rob’t r. livingston. gouv’r morris. col. alex. hamilton. hamilton committee provincial congress. head quarters, morristown, april 5, 1777. gentlemen: since last pleasure receiving reply two favors 29th ultimo 2d current. happy enough able inform you, indisposition, which occasion brevity last wrote, now removed. opinion advanced respecting enemy’s not moving before beginning may, seems shaken, though not entirely overthrown, some present appearances. received information embarking about three thousand men board transports, which lying hook, way staten island. this, conjectured, view delaware; supposition confirmed, circumstance confederacy lately detected philadelphia, who, among other things, endeavoring, temptation fifty pounds, engage persons pilots up river. extreme difficulties labor under want forage, infinite hazard run moving small body about five thousand men, enemy rear, incapable sparing any considerable body troops form post behind, asylum case accident,--these circumstances hardly allow think daring enough make attempt time. other hand, know progressive state numbers, other matters importance, prospect early reinforcement, state uncertainty any, bustling aspect european affairs, probable conceive necessity making push all risks. perhaps, however, embarkation intended some other purpose; make diversion, execute some partisan exploit elsewhere. whole, find difficult believe yet ready any capital operation. apprehensions attempt up north river, imagine discard any uneasiness score, although all times advisable watch against such contingency. almost reduced certainty, principal views enemy, ensuing campaign, directed towards southward, philadelphia more immediately; which idea, discovery before mentioned, respect pilots, inconsiderable confirmation. philadelphia object calculated strike attract attention. all along main source supplies towards war; getting into possession, deprive wheel very badly spare, great political military machine. sensible this, equally sensible, contains, itself, surrounded by, prodigious number persons attached them, inimical us, who lend all assistance could, further prosecution designs. also common well-grounded rule war, strike first principally, capital towns cities, order conquest country. confess not see any object equally interesting draw efforts northward. operations merely plundering devastation never answer end; could, one part continent nearly well another. notion forming junction northern army, cutting off communication between northern southern states, apprehend better speculation than practice. unless geography country far different any thing conceive, effect require chain posts, such number men each, never practicable maintainable, immense army. progress, hanging upon rear, seizing every opportunity skirmishing, situation rendered insupportably uneasy. fear mistake, general determined collect considerable body troops about peekskill, which not drawn off till intentions enemy acquired decisive complexion. ready, according conjunctures, either proceed northerly southerly, requisite. every precaution taken prevent boats destroyed, collecting them, first movement enemy, under cover one forts, into some inlet, difficult access, easily defensible small number men. loss irreparable disadvantage. enemy’s attempt upon peekskill demonstration folly any quantity stores places near water, much exposed sudden inroad. there never more there than sufficient answer present demands. lost good deal way different times, hope experience last make wiser. excellency lately visit oneida chief five others. managed good deal address, sent away perfectly satisfied. persuaded go philadelphia, declined it, alleging impatience return, remove erroneous opinions countrymen, misrepresentations british emissaries, which apprehensive draw into some rash proceedings. parted, after made most solemn protestations friendship good will. excellency very busy all day dispatching southern post, which prevented giving him resolve. will, doubt, very acceptable;

besides loss stores, which cannot well afford, opens new easy door which penetrate northern states. fix hitherto fluctuating disposition indians quarter favor, expose frontiers adjacent country depredations. though misfortune reason lament, dare say regarded much more important than really is, materially endangering success cause, which means case. opposition time too well matured, too great stability, shaken accident kind. while respectable army field, resources feed, clothe, arm them, safe. force sufficient foregoing part campaign, maintain such superiority over main army enemy effectually hinder attaining any purposes. and, northward, reinforcements sent up succor retreating garrison ticonderoga, militia flocking new england, think there little doubt time force adequate give mr. burgoyne seasonable check. one good effect result misfortune, which is, stimulate eastern states greater exertions than otherwise make. last advices, enemy possession all country between ticonderoga fort george;

precipitate himself into certain ruin, attempting advance into country very incompetent force. appearances lead suppose howe fool enough meditate southern expedition; now altered station staten island, mentioned above, fallen down hook. judging morally certain there co-operation two armies, thought expedient march northerly; accordingly reached within fourteen miles new windsor, place cross north river without danger interruption. new movement enemy’s fleet, induced return few miles, make disposition marching southerly. shall, however, cautious proceed course, lest nothing more than feint intended, divert real object. go southward earnest, capture philadelphia view; there other inducement. endeavor get there time oppose them; principal part continental force, large body spirited militia, many them, services during last campaign, pretty well inured arms, make opposition with. yet not much surprised philadelphia fall; enemy doubtless go there determination succeed all hazard; not able prevent them, without risking general action, expediency which depend upon circumstances. militia turn out zeal right expect, conduct enemy made last experiment jersies, supposed going philadelphia, without much inconvenience. fall materially short it, obliged confine ourselves skirmishing opposition, which cannot expect effectual. asked, if, avoid general engagement, give up objects first importance, hinder enemy carrying every important point, ruining us? answer is, hopes not placed any particular city spot ground, preserving good army, furnished proper necessaries, take advantage favorable opportunities, waste defeat enemy piecemeal. every new post take, requires new division forces, enables strike united force against part theirs: such present situation, another trenton affair amount complete victory part; too low ebb bear another stroke kind. perhaps, before opportunity sending this, facts unfold now endeavoring anticipate conjecture. expect some animadversions temper views french nation. presume nearly well acquainted assistance giving am, both intrigues foreign courts, supplies every kind warlike stores apparatus. not admit doubt interested wish success; conduct plainly shows, willing give every aid essential preservation. natural desire much convenience themselves can. apprehend not over fond plunging themselves into war england avoid it, still answer end pursue: and, indeed, evident reluctance shown part latter, any thing bring about such event, becomes extremely difficult draw into it. conclusion make, is, france not wish force england into war, unless finds affairs require absolutely; england not enter into one, till compelled it. best respects all friends; beg believe be, unabated regard, dear sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. [1] july 5, 1777. hamilton president congress. sept. 18, 1777. sir: congress not left philadelphia, immediately without fail; enemy means throwing party night into city. just now passed valley ford--in which party enemy came down fired upon boat, which means lost horse--one man killed, another wounded. boats abandoned, fall into hands. all prevent this, purpose. honor be, much respect, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. hon. john hancock. honorable john hancock, president congress. september 18, 1777, 9 o’clock night. sir: myself honor write hasty line evening, giving opinion, city longer place safety you. write again, lest letter not get hand. enemy road swedes ford, main body about four miles it. sent party evening daviser’s ferry, which fired upon some others crossing it, killed one man, wounded another, disabled horse. came suddenly, one boat left adrift other side, which course fall into hands; and, help that, get possession another, which abandoned who direction it, left afloat, spite every thing contrary. two boats convey fifty men across time, few hours throw over large party, perhaps sufficient overmatch militia who between city. renders situation congress extremely precarious, not guard: apprehensions great, though not improbable not realized. most cogent reasons oblige join army night, waited upon myself. hopes army up enemy before pass schuylkill: are, something serious ensue. honor be, much respect, sir, most obedient, a. hamilton. hamilton president congress. philadelphia, 22d september, 1777. sir: left camp last evening, came city superintend collection blankets clothing army. mr. lovell sends inform there express going off congress;

point out him many happy consequences accrue immediate reinforcement sent northern army; thought proper appoint duty, desire immediately set out albany; which place, neighborhood, imagine find general gates. fully acquainted principal points which sent, namely, state army, situation enemy, not enlarge heads. chiefly attend to, point out, clearest fullest manner, general gates, absolute necessity there detaching very considerable part army present under command, reinforcement this; measure will, all probability, reduce general howe same situation which general burgoyne now is, attempt remain philadelphia without able remove obstructions delaware, open free communication shipping. force which members council war judge safe expedient draw down present, three new hampshire fifteen massachusetts regiments, lee’s jackson’s two sixteen, additional. more than probable general gates detained part troops reduction ticonderoga, enemy not evacuated it; garrisoning it. should, case reinforcement according circumstances; but, possible, let made up same number out other corps. if, upon meeting general gates, find intends, consequence success, employ troops under command upon some expedition, prosecution which common cause more benefited than sent down reinforce army, not wish give any interruption plan. nothing more contemplation than particular objects which mentioned you, which unnecessary commit paper; case inform him, desire reinforcements before mentioned, such parts safely spared, immediately put motion join army. understood general gates already detached nixon’s glover’s brigades join general putnam; general dickinson informs me, sir henry clinton come down river whole force: fact, desire general putnam send two brigades forward greatest expedition, there occasion there. expect meet colonel morgan’s corps upon way down: do, let know essential services us; desire colonel commanding officer, hasten march much consistent health men after late fatigues. g. w. p.s. ordered detachment belonging general mcdougal’s division come forward. meet them, direct belonging greene’s, angel’s, chandler’s, duryee’s regiments, not cross delaware, proceed red bank. hamilton washington. fishkill, nov. 2, 1777. dear sir: lodged last night neighborhood new windsor. morning early met colonel morgan corps, about mile it, march head quarters. told him necessity making all dispatch could, not fatigue men too much, which promised do. understood colonel morgan, all northern army marching down both sides river, would, probably, to-morrow new windsor place; general putnam held council general disposition them, which resolved send four thousand men, keep rest side river. came here expectation matters such train enable accomplish errand without going any further, unless hasten troops march: arrival, learned mr. hughes, aid-de-camp general gates, following disposition northern army taken place. general patterson’s, glover’s, nixon’s brigades, colonel warner’s mountain boys, remain about albany: barracks building them. general poor’s brigade, marching down side river join general putnam, here probably to-morrow. general learned’s brigade, morgan’s corps, warner’s brigade massachusetts militia, some regiments new-york militia, march west side river. directed general putnam, name, send forward, all dispatch, join you, two continental brigades, warner’s militia brigade: last serve till latter end month. instructions not comprehend any militia: there certain accounts here, most troops new-york gone reinforce general howe; large proportion continental troops detained albany; concluded not disapprove measure calculated strengthen you, though small time, ventured adopt presumption. informed general putnam, general wynds, seven hundred jersey militia, king’s ferry, intention cross peekskill, prevailed upon him relinquish idea, send off immediate order march towards red bank. possible, however, unless excellency supports order application yourself, march men home, instead marching place directed repair to. neither lee’s, jackson’s regiments, nor detachments belonging general mcdougal’s division, yet marched. urged sent; order dispatched instantly proceeding. colonel hughes pressing some fresh horses me. moment ready, recross river, order fall troops other side, make all haste albany, get three brigades there sent forward. excellency permit observe, some doubts, under present circumstances appearances, propriety leaving regiments proposed left quarter? doubts subject stronger than are, forbid, sense council, interfering matter. general poor’s brigade just arrived here: proceed join all expedition. strongly impressed importance endeavoring crush mr. howe, apt think advisable draw off all continental troops. determined on, general warner’s sixteen hundred militia left here. honor be, warmest esteem respect, excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. hamilton washington. albany, november, 1777. dear sir: arrived here yesterday noon, waited upon general gates immediately, business mission; sorry find ideas not correspond yours, drawing off number troops directed. used every argument power, convince him propriety measure; inflexible opinion, two brigades, least, continental troops, remain near place. reasons were, intelligence sir henry clinton’s gone join howe, not sufficiently authenticated put out doubt; there was, therefore, possibility returning up river, which expose finest arsenal america (as calls one here) destruction, place left bare troops proposed; want conveniencies, difficulty roads, make impossible remove artillery stores considerable time; new england states left open depredations ravages enemy; put out power enterprise any thing against ticonderoga, which thinks done winter, which considers importance undertake. force reasons means strike me; every thing power show unsubstantial: all effect, one brigade dispatched, addition already marched. found myself infinitely embarrassed, loss act. felt importance strengthening much possible: but, other hand, found insuperable inconveniences, acting diametrically opposite opinion gentleman, whose successes raised him highest importance. general gates won entire confidence eastern states. disposed it, addressing himself prejudices people, find difficulty render measure odious, which said, plausibility enough believed, calculated expose unnecessary dangers, notwithstanding exertions, during campaign, given fullest title repose security. general gates influence interest elsewhere: use it, pleased, discredit measure there also. whole, appeared dangerous, insist sending more troops hence, while general gates appeared warmly opposed it. any accident, inconvenience, happen consequence it, there too fair pretext censure: many people too well disposed lay hold it. any rate, considered using him ill, take step contrary judgment, case nature. considerations, others which more explicit pleasure seeing you, determined not insist upon sending either other brigades remaining here. afraid done, not meet approbation, not perhaps fully warranted instructions: ventured thought right, hoping that, least, goodness intention excuse error judgment. induced relaxation more readily, directed sent on, two thousand militia, which not expected you; thousand continental troops out proposed left general putnam, which written him, since found matters circumstanced here, forward all dispatch. several reasons: because reinforcement more expeditious place than this: because two thousand continental troops peekskill not wanted present circumstances; especially really necessary body continental troops place, security valuable stores here: not, wish, think expedient draw off more than two three brigades now here. case, one ends proposed answered, leaving ten regiments general putnam, equally answered troops here; mean covering fortifying eastern states: one thousand continental troops addition militia collected, collected, here, sufficient, highlands, covering country down way, carrying works necessary raised defence river. troops gone, going, reinforce you, near five thousand rank file, continental troops; two thousand five hundred massachusetts new hampshire militia. seven hundred jersey militia, larger reinforcement than expected, though not quite equal number continental troops; nor exactly way directed. general lincoln tells me, militia very excellent; though time out last month, able, think proper, order troops still remaining here, join time term service expires. cannot forbear uneasy, lest conduct prove displeasing you: done what, considering all circumstances, appeared most eligible prudent. vessels preparing carry brigade new windsor, which embark evening. shall, afternoon, set out return camp; way, endeavor hasten troops forward. honor be, great esteem respect, excellency’s most ob’t, alex. hamilton. hamilton gates. albany, november 5, 1777. sir: inquiry, learned general patterson’s brigade, which one propose send, far weakest three now here, not consist more than about six hundred rank file fit duty. true, there militia regiment about two hundred; time service which regiment engaged, near expiring, past time men arrive destination. under circumstances, cannot consider either compatible good service, instructions excellency general washington, consent brigade selected three go him; under necessity desiring, virtue orders him, one others substituted instead this; either general nixon’s, general glover’s; pleased give immediate orders embarkation. knowing general washington wished pay greatest deference judgment, ventured far deviate instructions gave me, consent, compliance opinion, two brigades remain here instead one. same time permit observe, not myself sensible expediency keeping more than one, detached regiments neighborhood place; ideas coincide gentlemen whom consulted occasion, whose judgment much more reliance upon than own, who supposed thorough knowledge all circumstances. opinion is, one brigade, regiments before mentioned, amply answer purposes post. preferred opinion other considerations, not imagine pitch upon brigade little more than half large others: finding case, indispensably owe duty, desire, excellency’s name, another go instead one intended, without loss time. conducive dispatch, send glover’s brigade, agreeable you, give orders accordingly. honor be, real respect esteem, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. general gates. hamilton washington. new windsor, november 10th, 1777. dear sir: arrived here last night albany. given general gates little time recollect himself, renewed remonstrances necessity propriety sending more than one brigade three detained him; finally prevailed upon him give orders glover’s addition patterson’s brigade, march way. thought conducive expedition, send troops water, far done, procured all vessels albany, fit purpose; not get more than sufficient take patterson’s brigade. embarked seventh instant; wind contrary: probably here to-day. general glover’s brigade marched same time, east side river, roads much better than side. moment informed, one sloop, part patterson’s, arrived, others sight. immediately proceed, water, king’s ferry, thence take shortest route. pained beyond expression inform excellency, arrival here, find every thing neglected deranged general putnam; two brigades, poor’s learned’s, still remain here other side river fishkill. colonel warner’s militia, told, drawn peekskill, aid expedition against new-york, which, seems, is, time, hobby-horse general putnam. not least attention paid order, name, detachment one thousand men troops hitherto stationed post. every thing sacrificed whim taking new-york. two brigades poor learned, appears, not march want money necessaries; several regiments received pay six eight months past. there high mutiny among former account, which captain killed man, himself shot comrade. difficulties, want proper management, stopped troops proceeding. governor clinton only man who done any thing towards removing them; want general putnam’s co-operation, not able effect it. only able prevail learned’s brigade, agree march goshen; hopes, getting once go, induce continue march. coming here, immediately sent colonel bailey, who now commands learned’s brigade, persuaded him engage carry brigade head quarters fast possible. expects effect means five six thousand dollars, which governor clinton kind enough borrow me, which colonel bailey thinks keep men good humor till join you. marched morning towards goshen. shall, soon possible, see general poor, every thing power get him along; hope able succeed. plan before laid, totally deranged, new one become necessary. now too late send warner’s militia; time reached you, term service out. motive sending them, which give speedy reinforcement, has, past delay, superseded. governor clinton’s advice, sent order, most emphatical terms, general putnam, immediately dispatch all continental troops under him assistance; detain militia instead them. opinion is, only present use troops quarter, is, protect country depredations little plundering parties; carrying works necessary defence river. nothing more thought of. ’tis only wasting time, misapplying men, employ suicidal parade against new-york: undoubtedly terminate. new-york object, taken: take it, require more men than spared more substantial purposes. governor clinton’s ideas coincide mine. thinks there more continental troops here, than few give spur militia working upon fortifications. pursuance given directions before mentioned. general putnam attends them, troops under him nearly early any others (though has, unluckily, marched down tarrytown); general glover’s brigade, gets up, more than sufficient answer true end post. excellency agrees opinion, well send instant directions general putnam, pursue object mentioned: doubt whether attend any thing say, notwithstanding comes shape positive order. fear, unless interpose, works here go feebly, want men, not completed time: whereas, appears greatest importance pushed utmost vigor. governor clinton every thing power. wish general putnam recalled command post, governor clinton accept it: blunders caprices former endless. believe me, sir, nobody more impressed importance forwarding reinforcements coming you, all speed; nor any body endeavored promote more than done: _ignorance_ some, _design_ others, almost insuperable obstacles. very unwell; not spare myself get things immediately proper train; purpose intend, unless receive other orders you, continue troops progress march. soon get general poor’s brigade march, proceed general putnam’s peekskill. have, &c., alex. hamilton. excellency, general washington. hamilton washington. new windsor, november 12, 1777. dear sir: detained here two days fever, violent rheumatic pains throughout body. prevented active, person, promoting purposes errand;

whence pressed forward fast any influence make go. sorry say, disposition marching, officers men general, troops, not keep pace wishes, exigency occasion. have, unfortunately, imbibed idea, done part business campaign, now entitled repose. this, want pay, make averse long march advanced season. letter general putnam, just now received governor clinton, appears been, 10th instant, king’s street, white plains. answer last applications. enemy appear stripped new-york very bare. people there, is, tories, great fright: adds anxiety, reinforcements quarter not greater forwardness more considerable. written general gates, informing him accounts situation new-york respect troops, probability force gone howe greater than first expected; try not _extort_ him further reinforcement. don’t, however, expect much him; pretends view expedition against ticonderoga, undertaken winter: knows that, under sanction idea, calculated catch eastern people, may, without censure, retain troops. under necessity speaking plainly excellency, pleasure seeing you, not hesitate say, doubt whether man northern army, whole kept albany any decency. perhaps think blamable not exercised powers gave me, given positive order. perhaps so: but, deliberately weighing all circumstances, not, not, think advisable it. honor be, unfeigned esteem regard, excellency’s most ob’t servant, a. hamilton. excellency general washington. hamilton gates. fishkill, november 12, 1777. sir: ever since arrival quarter, endeavoring collect best idea state things new-york, order better form judgment probable reinforcement gone general howe. whole, fact well ascertained, new-york stripped bare possible: consequence this, few troops there, inhabitants, under strong apprehensions attack, almost amount _panic_; supply deficiency men, every effort making excite citizens arms defence city. purpose, public papers full addresses them, plainly speak apprehensions prevailing occasion. hence infer, formidable force gone general howe. calculations made who best opportunities judging, carry number six seven thousand. so, number gone, going, general washington, far inferior; five thousand utmost. militia all detained general putnam till became too late send them. state things gave pleasure seeing you, was, best knowledge, sacredly true. give present information, decide, whether any further succor propriety come you. fleet, troops board, sailed out hook fifth instant. circumstance demonstrates, beyond possibility doubt, general howe’s fixed intention endeavor hold philadelphia all hazards; removes all danger any further operations up north river winter. otherwise, sir henry clinton’s movement, advanced season, altogether inexplicable. propriety afford any further assistance, most expeditious manner conveying acquaint general putnam it, send troops him, replaced them. you, sir, best know uses which troops applied, determine accordingly. certain not excellency’s wish frustrate any plan view benefit service, far possibly avoided, consistent due attention more important objects. am, respect, sir, most obedient servant, alex. hamilton, a. d. c. general gates. hamilton washington. peekskill, nov. 15, 1777. dear sir: arrived place last night, unfortunately find myself unable proceed any further. imagining gotten better complaint, which confined governor clinton’s, anxious about attending march troops, day before yesterday crossed ferry, order fall general glover’s brigade, which march poughkeepsie fishkill. not, however, see myself, received letter colonel shepherd, who commands frigate, informing last night fishkill, night king’s ferry. wagons, &c., provided other side accommodation;

deservedly, account goodness cause, grandeur object, eclat generals, bravery troops--and (alas! obliged add) cruelty ferocity which marked route enemies; tons brothers’ blood which shed unhappy occasion! wrote two answers obliging letter, both which hope reached you; both which urged upon you, make collect such memoirs urgency affairs permit you; which furnish materials accurate history war, leisure fill up embellish such skeleton, all elegance dignity which fine pen capable. honorable post hold under great general washington, near person, give peculiar advantage delineating character, both amiable private virtues, military abilities. depend upon it, very minutiæ incomparable man read avidity posterity. know too well, hope, suspect superstition;

shield head every day battle--_will_ give him see america _free_, _flourishing_, _happy_--and _will_ adorn fame, among latest posterity, garland laurel, more verdant, blooming, enviable, than ever adorned brow _marlborough_! bearer line (if indeed fortunate put into hand) worthy friend, mr. cornelius durant, who possessed ardent desire honor short interview general washington; principally, say, seen spoken _the greatest man age_: and, indeed, considering mr. durant’s personal worth; uncommon zeal for, attachment to, american cause; losses sustained attempting assist her; extraordinary admiration of, love to, general’s character person; few men more richly merit indulgence. still exist, exist near general’s person (and not yet seen name among lists slain disgraced), easily procure him honor--and trust will. now blessed with, certified of, glorious news burgoyne’s surrender immortal gates; another bright star constellation american heroes: momently expecting hear, general washington done something like same general howe! yet tremble suspense--and indeed _painful one_. probably before letter goes, hear more matter. general accounts favorable: while _chevaux de frize_ defended, fears about philadelphia. campaign decide matter! time reaches you, (if all) winter quarters; perhaps leisure write half folio, which mr. durant take care write duplicates triplicates, fear miscarriage. piece mine, entitled “an address america, friend foreign government,” sent congress publication (if approved). know not yet fate. is, least, honestly designed animating piece, written incorrectly, hurry. seen it, pray give sentiments about it;

reason believe left peekskill before got there, conclude letter not received. not doubt there such unjust dishonorable practices committed inhabitants mention; nor reason believe without knowledge commanding officer department. complaints exhibited him cattle, property inhabitants state, living near col. robinson’s, drove off parties continental troops, sold vendue new england, without any account rendered proprietors; and, rightly informed, officer party, took sundry articles robinson’s, sent off sold like manner connecticut, not accounted states proceeds. informed general putnam, desired inquiry made into conduct officer commanding party, which more particularly induced, found given order quarter-master general payment teams employed carrying off effects; reason believe regard request. fully convinced, soldiery claim lawful prize every thing take within enemy’s lines, though property best friends, whatever taken beyond advanced posts, generous construction, comes within above predicament. principle several articles taken near robinson’s sold because enemy’s shipping then river near place; same principle indiscriminate plunder taken place both sides river high up manor livingston. little good expected army whose interest suffer country abandoned enemy, thereby justify plundering inhabitants. perhaps, don’t know uncharitable suppose, trade makes some people very fond little expeditions. long thought ascertain facts, seek redress not only parties immediately injured, public; time fully employed late about other matters obliged neglect it. expect line whenever leisure; assured always most kindly received, though perhaps not quite punctually answered most obedient servant, geo. clinton. respects capt. gibbs young livingston. hamilton william duer, m. c. head-quarters, 1778. dear sir: take liberty trouble few hints matter some importance. baron steuben, who bearer this, waits congress office[2] arranged upon some decisive permanent footing. not amiss guard. baron gentleman whom particular esteem; whose zeal, intelligence, success, consequence both, entitle him greatest credit. apprehensive, all good qualities, fondness power importance, natural every man, lead him wish more extensive prerogatives department than good service grant. sorry excite any prejudice against him account: perhaps mistaken conjecture. caution give harm am: not, maybe useful. either case, baron deserves considered valuable man, treated all deference which good policy warrant. first institution office, general allowed him exercise more ample powers than proper continuance. necessary commencement, put things train degree dispatch which exigency affairs required: necessary restrain them, even earlier than intended. novelty office excited questions about boundaries; extent operations alarmed officers every rank own rights. jealousies discontents rising fast height threatened overturn whole plan. became necessary apply remedy. general delineated functions inspectorship general orders, copy which sent congress. plan good, satisfactory army general. improved, unsafe deviate essentially it. course general’s intention, whatever regulations adopted him, undergo revision, receive sanction, congress: indispensable, present state army, power, time time, introduce authorize reformations necessary system. work which done occasional gradual steps; intrusted person spot, who thoroughly acquainted all defects, judgment sufficient adopt progressive remedies require. plan established congress, report board war conway appointed, appears exceptionable many respects. makes inspector independent commander-in-chief; confers powers which produce universal opposition army; and, making previous concurrence board war requisite introduction every regulation which found necessary, opens such continual source delay defeat usefulness institution. let commander-in-chief introduce, legislature afterwards ratify, reject, think proper. perhaps not differ much me, suppose, far relates board war, former scheme _brat faction_, therefore renounced. there one thing which baron much heart, which, good policy, means indulged in: power enforcing part discipline which understand subordination, obedience orders. power only properly lodged commander-in-chief, inflame whole army put into other hands. each captain vested company; each colonel regiment: each general particular command: commander-in-chief whole. began letter, not intend meddle any other subject than inspectorship; one just comes into head which appears small importance. goodness, force, army, depends much, perhaps more, composition corps which form it, collective number. composition good bad, not only according quality men, proportion completeness incompleteness corps respect numbers. regiment, instance, full complement officers, fifty sixty men, not half good company same number men. colonel look upon such command unworthy ambition, neglect despise it: captain pride himself it, take all pains power bring perfection. one case see total relaxation discipline, negligence every thing constitutes military excellence: other, there attention, energy, every thing wished. opinion, whether well ill-founded, governing principle human affairs. corps much below establishment, comparing be, loses all confidence itself; whole army loses confidence emulation which essential success. these, thousand other things occur you, make evident, most important advantages attend complete corps, proportional disadvantages reverse. ten thousand men, distributed into twenty imperfect regiments, not efficiency same number half number regiments. fact is, respect american army, want discipline, other defects labor under, much owing skeleton state regiments any other cause. then? any prospect filling regiments? opinion is, nearly arrived _ne plus ultra_. so, reduce number corps, give substance consistency which want, incorporating together, bring near establishment. measure army infinitely improved; state saved expense maintaining number superfluous officers. present condition regiments, incapable even performing common exercises without joining two more together: expedient reluctantly submitted officers who see themselves made second command battalion, instead first, commission imports; which happens every younger colonel whose regiment united elder. inconveniencies, while officers who remain command, who selected others account superior merit, applaud themselves preference given them, rejoice change which confers such additional consequence themselves? who excluded measure, return home discontented, make noise, which soon subside forgotten among matters greater moment. quiet still more effectually, thought necessary, put upon half-pay certain time. if, considering matter, agree sentiment, wished scheme immediately adopted, while arrangement now hand still unexecuted. made, rather inconvenient, immediately after, unhinge throw whole system again afloat. determined last arrangement, not know success different states draughting recruiting. then improper reduce number corps, proposed. now seen success: prospect seeing regiments filled;

heureusement que je viens de l’attraper, car à force de courir je suis arrivé à temps pour l’évacuation dont il voulait encore priver. le malheur de ne pas être à la première affaire m’a fait la peine la plus vive, et je ne m’en consolerai jamais, quoique ce soit bien loin d’être ma faute. les deux retraites font honneur aux troupes et au général sullivan, qui s’y est conduit parfaitement, elles en font rue aux anglais et à leur généraux qui n’ont montré ni activité, ni génie, du moins à ce qu’il paraît. le malheureux mr. tousard eu le bras emporté au milieu d’une des actions les plus valeureuses qui ait été faite. c’est un homme aussi brave qu’il est honnête. je crains d’embarrasser le général en lui mandant ce que je voudrais qu’on fît pour lui; mais la commission de major ne pouvait-elle pas se changer en celle de lieutenant colonel; il avait fait un arrangement avant de partir _le grand arrangement de mr. du coudray_, où en cas de la perte d’un membre, ils devaient avoir une pension de tant, cet arrangement-là qui comme vous savez n’a pas été accepté, ne pouvait-il pas se renouveler en sa faveur. il faut que vous rendiez un grand service; c’est de mander le plus de détails possibles sur la flotte de lord howe,--les moyens qui existent à new-york, etc. etc. mr. d’estaing beaucoup de raisons de croire qu’il est arrivé quelques vaisseaux d’angleterre, autres le cornwall. mandez-moi dans une longue lettre, mon cher hamilton, ce que vous pensez sur ce qui été fait, ce qui va se faire, et ce qui pouvait être fait dans la suite. votre dépêche trouvera à warren, petite ville près de la providence, où je vais m’occuper à garder beaucoup de pays avec peu de troupes, et où sans répondre d’empêcher une descente des ennemis, je ferai le moins mal possible; si forces égales, je tâcherai de les battre. flatte que le général viendra ici lui-même; dieu le veuille. les affaires sur lesquelles je vous ai écrit mes complaintes, l’appaisent un peu, mais pour prendre rhode island il nous faut le général washington. j’attends de vos nouvelles par mons de pontgibault et finirai simplement ma lettre en vous assurant de mon tendre attachement. lafayette. hamilton ----. head quarters, nov. 8, 1778. dear sir: received favor 4th, pleasure communicate intelligence head quarters. morning third one hundred eight sail vessels sailed out hook,--supposed, best calculations, contain seven eight thousand men. first steered eastward, soon after changed course bore s. e. wind n. w. general accounts new-york speak three distinct embarkations--one west indies--another halifax--another st. augustine. one division, which seems best ascertained, contains ten twelve british regiments, most new levies, which probably went above-mentioned fleet. much pretty certain, embarkation continued since departure fleet, which strong circumstance favor general evacuation. all vessels least out repair drawn up different ship-yards, repairs going all possible vigor. whether merchants packing up not, point still much _in dubio_;

time which elapsed, made more possible, count determined prosecute any further operations continent, not lose time procedure sort, content himself sending some transports, under escort few frigates, receive provisions fleet, proceed himself directly hook. supposition, position lewistown entirely ineligible. distance which city, well hook; delays consequently attend intelligence every quarter; difficulty impossibility, sometimes, traversing bay, made first situation inconvenient every respect, event fleet’s proceeding immediately hook. considerations induced cross delaware, take position which now are;

finding, closer examination, unable defend hook, determined relinquish attempt. seems more likely, major lee mentions, part hulks, sunk channel, gotten afloat drifted ashore. experience difficulty obstructing channel, may, perhaps, attributed change suppose. confirmed conjecture, evacuation two posts king’s ferry, which appears, excellency’s letter, taken place 21st, five days after supposed arrival vessel georgia; proof not received information any decisive good fortune side, ill fortune ours; persisted defensive plan. persuaded, too, exultation given wings any good news received, reached before this. season less advanced, regret change disposition;

mais je désire absolument d’être gratifié en ceci. adieu je vous attends à dîner et j’ai l’honneur d’être. general du portail. col. hamilton. hamilton laurens. cold professions--warm friendships--i wish, dear laurens, power, actions, rather than words, convince love you. only tell you, till bid adieu, hardly knew value taught heart set upon you. indeed, friend, not well done. know opinion entertain mankind;

whether heard, here, count d’estaing still coast twentieth november, cannot decide: one inclined think, disconcerted, either false intelligence, total defect it. entreat you, dear friend, transmit earliest most accurate relation obtained, british movements;

every one, partiality own ideas, wishes convey who charged management affairs. channel public papers, commonly made use purpose, appears exceptionable several accounts. not only restrains freedom discussion, extreme delicacy subject; discussion itself increases evil, exposing weak sides popular eye, adding false terrors well-founded apprehensions which situation authorizes. instead pursuing method, prefer addressing myself member body, whose power alone is, well-digested system, extricate embarrassments. pitched upon you, personal knowledge abilities zeal. offer any thing new useful, persuaded endeavor turn advantage. contrary case, am, least, harm. only trouble writing, reading, few useless pages. object principal concern state currency. opinion, all speculations head founded error. most people think, depreciation avoided, provident arrangements beginning, without any aid abroad: great many sanguine politicians, till very lately, imagined money still restored expedients within ourselves. hence delay attempting procure foreign loan. idea proceeded ignorance real extent resources. war, particularly first periods, required exertions beyond strength, which neither population nor riches equal. fullest proof this, constant thinness armies; impossibility, time, recruiting otherwise than compulsion; scarcity hands husbandry, other occupations; decrease staple commodities; difficulty every species supply. aware badness money influence; originally effect, not cause, though now partakes nature both. part evils appear, finances more flourishing condition. experienced before money materially depreciated; contributed depreciation. want men soon obliged public pay extravagant wages every department. agriculture languished defect hands. mechanic arts same. price every kind labor increased: articles foreign commerce, interruption received, more than kept pace other things. relative value money determined greater less portion labor commodities which purchase; whatever gained price, course lost value. public expenditures, dearness every thing, necessarily became immense; greater proportion than other countries; much beyond any revenues which best concerted scheme finance extracted natural funds state. taxes, which people capable bearing, quantity money which deemed proper medium country (had gold instead paper), sufficient current exigencies government. most opulent states europe, war any duration, commonly obliged recourse foreign loans subsidies.[3] how, then, expect without them, not augment quantity artificial wealth beyond bounds which proper preserve credit? idea chimerical. quantity money formerly circulation among us, estimated about thirty millions dollars. barely sufficient interior commerce. exterior commerce chiefly carried barter. sent commodities abroad, brought back others return. balance principal branch against us; little _specie_ derived others, transferred directly payment balance, without passing into home circulation. impracticable, loans taxes, bring such portion forementioned sum into public coffers answered purposes war: nor spared considerable part, without obstructing operations domestic commerce. taxes limited, not only quantity wealth state, temper, habits, genius people; all which, country, conspired render moderate: loans, men not prevailed upon lend money public there scarcity, find more profitable way employing otherwise, case. ordinary revenues united provinces amount about twenty-five millions guilders; two millions two hundred fifty thousand pounds sterling per annum. is, proportion territory numbers, richest country world; country people sustain heaviest load taxes. population about equal ours, two millions souls. burthens subject great, some held almost impracticable, even extraordinary emergencies, enlarge revenues new impositions. maintained, dependence, cases, extraordinary contributions wealthy individuals; aid which, some wars, raised four millions sterling year. country possessed vast stock wealth, taxes carried such height; means paying infinitely exceed power; national revenues only amount sum stated, inadequate product any taxes levied, demands service! loans, reason before hinted, out question; least, trifling object little importance. suppose able raise million sterling, annually; sum probably exceeded ability; unequal wants![4] economy made bear any proportion, especially recur causes already enumerated, which currency depreciated first stages. reasonings results, not power congress, emissions arrived thirty millions dollars, put stop them.[5] obliged, order keep up supplies, go creating artificial revenues new emissions; multiplied, value declined. progress depreciation retarded, not prevented. was, great degree, necessary. there one remedy; foreign loan. all other expedients rather considered auxiliary. loan obtained, judiciously applied, assisted vigorous system taxation, avoided excess emissions which ruined paper. credit such fund procured loans moneyed trading men within ourselves; because directed, beneficial commercial transactions abroad.[6] necessity foreign loan now greater than ever. nothing else retrieve affairs. wheels government, without it, cannot much longer kept motion. including loan-office certificates, state emissions, about four hundred millions dollars circulation. real value these, less than seven millions, which true circulating medium states: though price specie rate exchange sterling bills nominal value every commodity least sixty one, average. all reasonings against possibility raising current expenses foundation thirty millions, apply present situation ratio thirty seven; is, thirty seven less practicable now than emissions amounted only thirty millions. every dollar circulation brought annually into treasury, which never effected any country, politically impossible, revenue not equal yearly expense. hope appreciating money, taxes domestic loans, end. fast received, issued daily expenditures. momentary interval between drawn out circulation returning into it, prevent receiving least advantage. reasonings appear useless, necessity foreign loan now acknowledged, measures taking procure it. intended establish good principles; want which brought desperate crisis arrived at, still betray into fatal mistakes. loan employed, now question; difficulty equal importance! two plans proposed: one, purchase up once, specie, sterling bills, all superfluous paper; endeavor, taxes, loans, economy, hinder returning into circulation. remainder, supposed, then recover value. this, said, reduce public debt sterling cost paper. suppose two hundred millions purchased, rest called taxes. require bills amount dollars. doubt whether four times sum sufficient. moment known such purchases made, avarice speculators begin operate: demand immediately occasion artificial appreciation; each successive million cost more than preceding. appreciation more relative purchasing medium than prices commodities. raising value paper relative former, depend combination few artful individuals, easily accomplished. diminution prices slow, implies change sentiments body people respect money. sudden revolution general rates all necessaries life not expected. prices these, reached present summit degrees, must, degrees, revert former station. minds people not readily admit impressions favor currency. all past experience given habit diffidence; epidemical spirit extortion maintain violent struggle whatever tendency produce fall prices. permanent reduction quantity circulating cash, alone gradually effect it. not happen present plan. necessity continuing supplies nearly same rates now given (which case reasonings true), nearly same effect mentioned respect taxes domestic loans. money return into circulation almost fast drawn out: end year find treasury empty; foreign loan dissipated; state finances deplorable ever. moderate calculation, spent ten twelve millions real dollars, sole purpose carrying war another year. much better, instead purchasing up paper currency, purchase supplies out specie bills. first instance, public suffer direct loss artificial appreciation, relative purchasing medium: last, buy value commodities specie bills. great source error disquisitions nature, judging events abstract calculations; which, though geometrically true, false relate concerns beings governed more passion prejudice, than enlightened sense interests. degree illusion mixes itself all affairs society. opinion objects more influence than real nature. quantity money circulation certainly chief cause decline: find depreciated more than five times much rule. excess derived opinion;

je suis aussi très fâché de n’avoir pas su tout cela dans le temps pour vous le mander. car il était encore temps alors d’aller dans le sud; maintenant je ne sais plus que désirer. cependant hier l’on nous débitait que des vaisseaux de transport servant de vaisseaux de guerre étaient arrivés à new-york pour prendre des renforts; si cela était si confirmé, il n’y aurait apparence que les anglais ne se proposaient pas de commencer leurs opérations avant l’arrivée de ces renforts, alors ce serait peut être le cas d’y aller. je laisse tout cela à faire à votre prudence, et à votre amitié, vous savez une partie des raisons que j’ai toujours eu et que j’ai encore de ne point faire de demande à ce sujet au général washington, mais vous savez aussi combien je désire d’aller en caroline. s’il y quelque apparence que je puisse y arriver à temps, je ne vois pas d’inconvénient à ce que vous faisiez usage auprès du géneral de ce qui s’est passé dans le congrès, parce que plusieurs membres de congrès l’ont déjà dit à différentes personnes. (si vous voulez ensuite que je vous parle comme à mon ami, je vous dirai que j’ai eu lieu de voir que de m’envoyer là bas, aurait fait un fort bon effet ici, surtout dans le commencement.) supposez donc, que notre géneral jugeât par des circonstances ultérieures qu’il peut encore être temps de m’y envoyer, comme il ne faut pas perdre un moment, il serait bon que je ne fusse pas obligé de retourner au camp. pour cela il faudrait m’envoyer avec les ordres, toutes les lettres nécessaires pour le géneral lincoln et autres. vous savez, mon cher colonel, ce que je désire à cet égard. si je vais là-bas, il faut que mon arrivée soit comme un de ces accidents au théâtre qui réveille les spectateurs, et redonne de l’activité et de la chaleur à la pièce, vous m’entendez. je crois que dans ce cas le général doit écrire au congrès, outre les raisons qu’il de m’envoyer pour le prier de faire donner tous les moyens nécessaires pour faire diligence. enfin, prenez bien garde à ceci, mon cher colonel, si vous m’envoyez des ordres, sitôt que cela sera décidé, envoyez chercher monsieur de l’estaing, mon aide-de-camp, et dites lui s’il vous plaît de faire partir sur le champ ma malle et la sienne sur un waggon du quartier maître, s’il y en qui partant sur le champ, sinon sur mon propre waggon: qu’il n’oublie pas surtout mes papiers. il peut ensuite venir après lui même et m’apporter les lettres du général. il faut qu’il fasse diligence; je ne puis partir sans différentes choses qui sont dans ma malle; qu’il se munisse lui même de ce qu’il lui faut. mon adresse ici est: mrs. sword logan alley, second-street. je ne partirai point d’ici avant lundi prochain afin d’attendre votre réponse. j’ai l’honneur d’être, mon cher colonel, avec le plus parfait attachment, votre très humble et très obéissant servant, du portail. col. hamilton. schuyler hamilton. philadelphia, april 8, 1780. dear sir: mentioned private conversation go secretary embassy court versailles;

tous les changements qui pouvraient survenir sur ces objets doivent m’être communiqués, afin qu’à votre arrivée vous puissiez avoir sous les yeux le plus de données possibles. les mêmes détails vous attendent à rhode island, et si vous ne devez les reçevoir qu’après être arrivé, il est presque indifférent, monsieur le chevalier, que votre escadre atterisse à rhode island ou au cap henry; mais il y des circonstances qui, si elles vous étaient connues, tendraient peut être à vous déterminer plutôt pour l’un de ces points que pour l’autre, ou même pour un troisième point que vos instructions n’ont pu prévoir. c’est pour vous rendre compte de ces circonstances que je saisis l’occasion du fier rodrique; heureux si, dans une conjoncture où les moments sont d’une si grande importance, cette lettre peut anticiper de quelques jours vos dispositions. 1º. par le plan proposé à vous, monsieur le chevalier, et à monsieur le comte de rochambau, les efforts combinés de l’armée française et americaine doivent se porter sur new-york, et vous êtes instamment prié de vous rendre immédiatement à sandy hook. 2º. suivant les informations qui m’ont été récemment fournies par le gouverneur de la virginie, la ville de charlestown est prise; les ennemis embarquent une partie des troupes qui en ont fait la conquête; et d’après la certitude où nous sommes que la destination de votre escadre leur est connue, il semble que cet embarquement pourrait bien avoir pour objet de renforcer la garnison de new-york. 3º. la somme de leurs forces navales sur ce continent se borne à trois vaisseaux de ligne, un de 50 canons, deux de 44, et quelques frégates à charlestown; un vaisseau de 74 et quelques frégates, sortis de new-york depuis trois semaines et dont nous ignorons la destination. ainsi, monsieur le chevalier, la première de ces considérations vous invite à sandy hook; la seconde réclame votre atterrage sur un point d’où vous puissiez être en mesure d’intercepter les secours destinés pour new-york, et la troisième vous offre un terme de comparaison entre la plus grande force qui puisse escorter ces secours, et celle avec laquelle vous pouvez les attaquer. il est encore à observer qu’excepté les trois vaisseaux de ligne, tous les autres (à charlestown) sont dans le port, et que les plus gros n’en peuvent sortir, qu’après avoir été allégés, et avec la concurrence d’une haute marée et d’un vent propice. telles sont, monsieur le chevalier, les choses dont ma mission pour objet de vous rendre compte, et comme il est de toute importance que ces informations vous parviennent le plus tôt possible, j’ai cru ne pas devoir négliger la probabilité, qui s’offre de les faire devancer votre arrivée. en supposant, monsieur le chevalier, que le fier rodrique vous rencontre et que vous jugiez à propos de vous rendre en droiture à sandy hook, il est un moyen de faire que les dépâches qui vous attendent à rhode island et du cap henry vous parviennent aussi promptement qui si vous aviez atterri à l’un de ces deux points: ce serait de dépêcher, vers l’un ou l’autre, l’un de vos plus légers vaisseaux qui recevrait à son bord l’officier chargé de ces dépêches, et vous irait rejoindre vers sandy hook, où vraisemblablement il se rendrait aussitôt que votre flotte, ou du moins beaucoup plus tôt que les réponses de général washington ou de monsieur le marquis de la fayette, aux lettres qui leur annonceraient votre arrivée. si le cap henry était le point choisi, j’oserais vous prier, monsieur le chevalier, afin d’éviter tous délais, d’ordonner qu’à la vue, du signal que vous savez, le vaisseau y réponde par un signal contraire, je veux dire en avertissant la position des pavillons; qu’il envoie sa chaloupe à terre avec un officier muni des mots de reconnaissance; que cet officier donne la première partie de ces mots et reçoive de moi la seconde. par là je crois, monsieur le chevalier, que toute possibilité de surprise est sauvée, de part et d’autre, sans qu’il y ait un seul instant de perdre par le cérémonial de la reconnaissance. je suis, &c. &c. &c. a. hamilton. monsieur le chevalier de ternay. hamilton baron steuben. whippany, june 25, 1780. dear baron: enemy, day before yesterday, made forward movement springfield, which burnt, retired elizabethtown point. same evening crossed over staten island;

whatever improper, improperly stated, impute inability only: there please let rest, take good part say, proceeds zeal affection you, regard cause am engaged in. consideration excuse me, any seem exceed bounds which custom prescribed subalterns, treat any thing, adopt modes, superiors. continual change commanding officers, commandants, is, humble opinion, injurious post, hurtful military duty, absolutely requisite performed, preserved garrison. there nation war which pursues like mode excepting us; am therefore induced, not only consideration, weighty experience during station post, offer opinion impropriety, bad consequences. visible ill creates; damage innumerable things; irregularity continually causes; lastly, total loss many thousands which been, daily are, expended national fabric, which inevitably fall pieces, unless officer fixed post (and who competent judge fortifications, military man), matters which, think, demand consideration. town-major, good barrack-master, necessary here, necessaries life are. former regulate duty keep up discipline jurisdiction: latter take care buildings, which otherwise destroyed. next thing which falls attention, public provision, which been, daily is, exposed here lost, stolen, damaged, want sufficient shelter proper repositories. troops suffered, still suffer, other causes. cheated weights, measure, scanty allowance fatigue rum; which attest, appointed, after represented matter general m’dougall, inspect into some abuses. notwithstanding many thousands boards which came here, there not sufficient barracks, bunks, etc. fast one thing built up, another torn down again. there not, all garrison, proper guard-house conveniency soldiers, nor security criminals. powder magazine, nor store reception reserve implements war. short, whole appears, present, under care ungovernable undisciplined militia, like wild tartar’s camp, instead shining fortification all america thinks not only insurmountable barrier against incursion enemy, likewise easy defence case unforeseen disaster army. however, return subject. importance heads already mentioned, connection preceding, will, hope, obtain pardon digression into which led me; discretion leave state. letter wrote general knox some time last winter, among many things say concerning ordnance myself, made remark, wit: “that relieving officer garrison, not like relief field: officer who knows himself relieved, leave many things undone next do; which seen, heard, experienced. beside, after once every thing rights, men then desist labor, exercise guns. new commanding officers chiefly new systems defence, which add labor labor, nothing formed systematically.” already stated more things minutely general officers here, who all agreed validity propriety. they, all liable immediate removal, there cannot any thing formed into permanent regular system. moreover, informed, owing mismanagement predecessors, obliged, after taken command, hunt materials order build own systems; issue orders upon orders, acquaint themselves persons who have, were, keeping, several branches which flow into department. let once more, confidence, assure you, suffer incessant pain sad state garrison in. rectify defects, dear sir, roused arms, never attainable. therefore let beg assist adopting some plan which soldierly, good service: which, however, done other manner, such hinted you. let general arnold all sagacity imaginable, take him some time get himself well acquainted position defence post; especially there not one single continental officer left here who any way assist him. every thing seems new here; very engineer transferred hence, whom he, some measure, depended information, regard weakest strongest parts fortress. not yet told one hundredth part say upon some subjects; finish prognosticating, ever capriciousness hold sway here, prove fatal post. am, due respect, sir, most humble servant, s. bauman, major artillery. de marbois hamilton. philadelphia, 21 aout, 1780. je viens de recevoir mon cher colonel votre lettre du 17 de ce mois. vous m’y parlez de mes frères comme si vous étiez sûr qu’ils sont en effet prisonniers. avez-vous sur cet article plus de connaissance que je n’en ai, m’avez-vous déjà écrit à ce sujet quelque lettre qui ne serait point parvenue. je vais écrire à m. de ternay à ce sujet, mais en attendant je vous prie de vouloir bien communiquer tous les éclaircissements que vous aurez pu vous procurer, et d’être persuadé que rien ne touche plus que de leur procurer de soulagement s’ils sont en effet entre les mains de l’ennemi. si vous avez quelques nouvelles dernières touchant l’embarcation que m. le général clinton prépare, je vous prie de vouloir bien m’en instruire, cet article étant de la plus grande importance pour nous. je vous embrasse de tout mon cœur. de marbois. col. hamilton. williams hamilton. hillsborough, august 30, 1780. dear hamilton: about twenty-third instant, wrote friend harrison salisbury, giving him very hasty particular account defeat general gates’s army sutton’s, near campden, sixteenth instant. truly unfortunate, completely routed. infamous cowardice militia virginia north carolina, gave enemy every advantage over few regular troops, whose firm opposition gallant behavior gained applause, well successful foes, runaway friends. mentioned col. harrison loss two howitzers, mistaken. eight pieces light artillery, six ammunition wagons, which, greatest part baggage, lost. retreat most mortifying happened. who escaped dangers field, knew not find protection: wounded found relief inhabitants, who immediately arms against us; many fugitive officers men disarmed faithless villains, who flattered promises joining against enemy. tories now assembling different parts country; there actually sort partisan war waged between whigs country. greatest part baggage plundered who first left field. enemy took part; much escaped them, pillaged inhabitants retreat. wagon horses stolen, frequently taken drivers; some desperate rascals daring enough fire upon parties regular troops many miles place action. general gates used utmost expedition getting lost field place. step unaccountable me, expect know reason another time, better authority. unfortunate general usually loses confidence army; much case present. however, suppose every thing necessary done, justification steps taken, then all understood. beside ignorance, there another reason silence subject. general extremely mortified disappointment hopes met with; think ungenerous oppress dejected spirits premature censure. legislature state now sitting place, devising means defending country. general exhibited estimates (he informs me) supplies wanting carry campaign, both legislature state, virginia; hopes furnished. officers north carolina talk confidently re-embodying great number militia. general stephens collected about eight hundred virginia militia place since action. am sorry add, least half number deserted. maryland division, including delaware regiment, will, hope, muster six hundred all collected. part now here: party general smallwood ellis’s ferry, adkin river; small party major anderson, who general smallwood left some time charlotte, receive fugitives arrived. place general rendezvous. best accounts get, lord cornwallis him, day battle, seventy-first, sixty-third, thirty-third, twenty-third british regiments; corps hessians, tarlton’s legion, some new levies, amounting about three thousand men. numbers very little greater; force not imagined great, who informed long march barren country, very little other subsistence than short allowance fresh beef, green corn, apples, peaches. soon recover relaxation spirits, which all present complaint, write again, inform resolved not despair, bear fortunes like veterans south; while you, like heroes north, win wear laurels present campaign. present most respectful compliments general, whom love; all friends head quarters camp. not man among generous enough write single sentence sincere friend servant, o. h. williams. mentioned surprise general sumpter’s party, which happened sixteenth instant, last. hamilton james duane. liberty pole, september 8, 1780. dear sir: agreeably request, promise, sit down give ideas defects present system, changes necessary save ruin. may, perhaps, reveries projector, rather than sober views politician. judge them, make use please them. fundamental defect want power congress. hardly worth while show consists, seems universally acknowledged; point out happened, only question remedy it. may, however, said, originated three causes; excess spirit liberty, which made particular states show jealousy all power not own hands; jealousy led exercise right judging last resort measures recommended congress, acting according own opinions propriety, necessity; diffidence, congress, own powers, which timid indecisive resolutions: constantly making concessions states, till scarcely left themselves shadow power; want sufficient means disposal answer public exigencies, vigor draw forth means; which occasioned depend states individually, fulfil engagements army; consequence which, ruin influence credit army, establish dependence each state separately, rather than _on them_, is, rather than whole collectively. pleaded, congress never any definite powers granted them, and, course, exercise none, nothing more than recommend. manner which congress appointed, warrant, public good required, considered themselves vested full power _to preserve republic harm_. done many highest acts sovereignty, which always cheerfully submitted to: declaration independence; declaration war: levying army; creating navy; emitting money; making alliances foreign powers; appointing dictator, etc., etc. all implications complete sovereignty never disputed, standard whole conduct administration. undefined powers discretionary powers, limited only object which given; present case, independence freedom america. confederation made difference; not generally adopted, operation. recollect it, congress even descended authority which spirit act gives them; while particular states further attended it, than suited pretensions convenience. take too much time enter into particular instances, each which separately appear inconsiderable; united, serious import. only mean remark, not censure. confederation itself defective, requires altered. neither fit war nor peace. idea uncontrollable sovereignty, each state, over internal police, defeat other powers given congress, make union feeble precarious. there instances without number, acts, necessary general good, which rise out powers given congress, interfere internal police states; there many instances which particular states, arrangements internal police, effectually, though indirectly, counteract arrangements congress. already examples this, which refer own memory. confederation gives states, individually, too much influence affairs army. nothing it. entire formation disposal military forces, belong congress. essential cement union: policy congress, destroy all ideas state attachments army, make look up wholly them. purpose, all appointments, promotions, provisions, whatsoever, made them. apprehended dangerous liberty. nothing appears more evident me, than run much greater risk weak disunited federal government, than one which able usurp upon rights people. already some lines army obey states opposition congress, notwithstanding pains taken preserve unity army. any thing hinder this, personal influence general; melancholy mortifying consideration. forms state constitutions, always give great weight affairs, make too difficult bend pursuit common interest; too easy oppose whatever not like: form partial combinations subversive general one. there wide difference between situation, empire under one simple form government, distributed into counties, provinces, districts, which legislatures, merely magistratical bodies, execute laws common sovereign. here danger is, sovereign too much power, oppress parts which composed. case, empire composed confederated states; each government completely organized within itself, all means draw subjects close dependence itself; danger directly reverse. is, common sovereign not power sufficient unite different members together, direct common forces interest happiness whole. leagues among old grecian republics proof this. continually war each other; and, want union, fell prey neighbors. frequently held general councils; resolutions further observed, than suited interests inclinations all parties; and, length, sunk entirely into contempt. swiss cantons another proof doctrine. wars each other, which fatal them, not different powers, neighborhood, too jealous one another, too equally matched, suffer either take advantage quarrels. remained long united all, attributed weakness, poverty, causes just mentioned. ties not exist america; little time hence, some states powerful empires; remote other nations, all leisure opportunity wish, cut each other’s throats. germanic corps also cited example favor position. united provinces thought one against it. family stadtholders, whose authority interwoven whole government, strong link union between them. physical necessities, habits founded upon them, contributed it. each province too inconsiderable, itself, undertake any thing. analysis present constitutions, show many ties which not exist ours; means proper model us. own experience satisfy us. felt difficulty drawing out resources country, inducing states combine equal exertions common cause. ill success last attempt striking. some done great deal; others little, scarcely any thing. disputes about boundaries, etc., testify flattering prospect future tranquillity, not frame, time, confederacy capable deciding differences, compelling obedience respective members. confederation, too, gives power purse too entirely state legislatures. provide perpetual funds, disposal congress, land tax, poll tax, like. all imposts upon commerce laid congress, appropriated use. for, without certain revenues, government power. power which holds purse-strings absolutely, rule. seems medium which, without making congress altogether independent, tend give reality authority. another defect system, want method energy administration. partly resulted other defect; great degree prejudice, want proper executive. congress kept power too much own hands, meddled too much details every sort. congress is, properly, deliberative corps; forgets itself attempts play executive. impossible such body, numerous is, constantly fluctuating, ever act sufficient decision, system. two-thirds members, one half time, cannot know gone before them, connection subject hand transacted former occasions. members who more permanent, only give information promotes side espouse present case; often mislead enlighten. variety business distract; proneness every assembly debate, all times delay. lately, congress, convinced inconveniences, gone into measure appointing boards. is, opinion, bad plan. single man, each department administration, greatly preferable. give chance more knowledge, more activity, more responsibility, and, course, more zeal attention. boards partake part inconveniences larger assemblies. decisions slower, energy less, responsibility more diffused. not same abilities knowledge administration single men. men first pretensions not readily engage them; because less conspicuous, less importance, less opportunity distinguishing themselves. members boards take less pains inform themselves arrive eminence, because fewer motives it. all reasons conspire give preference plan vesting great executive departments state hands individuals. men be, course, all times under direction congress, blend advantages monarchy republic constitution. question made, whether single men found undertake offices. think could; because there then every thing excite ambition candidates. but, order this, congress, manner appointing them, line duty marked out, show earnest making officers, officers real trust importance. fear little vanity stood way arrangements, though lessen importance congress, leave nothing do. precisely same rights powers heretofore, happily disencumbered detail. inspect conduct ministers, deliberate upon plans, originate others public good; only observing rule: consult ministers, get all information advice them, before entered into any new measures, made changes old. third defect is, fluctuating constitution army. pregnant source evil: all military misfortunes, three-fourths civil embarrassments, ascribed it. general fully enumerated mischiefs it, letter congress, only repeat said, therefore refer letter. imperfect unequal provision made army, fourth defect, which find delineated same letter. without speedy change, army dissolve. now mob, rather than army; without clothing, without pay, without provision, without morals, without discipline. begin hate country neglect us. country begin hate oppressions them. congress long jealous us. now lost all confidence them, give worst construction all do. held together slenderest ties, ripening dissolution. present mode supplying army, state purchases, not one least considerable defects system. too precarious dependence; because states never sufficiently impressed necessities. each make own ease primary object; supply army secondary one. variety channels through which business transacted, multiply number persons employed, opportunities embezzling public money. popular spirit which most governments turn, state agents men less character ability: nor there rigid responsibility among them, there easily among employ continent; course, not much diligence, care, economy. very little money raised several states, go into continental treasury, pretence, all exhausted providing quotas supplies; public without funds other demands government. expense ultimately much greater, advantages much smaller. actually feel insufficiency plan; reason dread, under it, ruinous extremity want. principal defects, present system, now occur me. there many inferior ones, organization particular departments, many errors administration, which pointed out; task troublesome tedious: once remedied mentioned, others not attended much difficulty. now propose remedies, which appear applicable circumstances, necessary extricate affairs present deplorable situation. first step be, give congress powers competent public exigencies. happen two ways: one, resuming exercising discretionary powers suppose originally vested them, safety states; resting conduct candor countrymen, necessity conjuncture: other, calling immediately convention all states, full authority conclude finally upon general confederation; stating them, beforehand, explicitly, evils arising want power congress, impossibility supporting contest present footing; delegates come, possessed proper sentiments, well proper authority, give efficacy meeting. commission include right vesting congress whole, proportion, unoccupied lands, employed purpose raising revenue: reserving jurisdiction states whom granted. first plan, expect, thought too bold expedient, generality congress; and, indeed, practice hitherto, riveted opinion want power, success experiment very well doubted. see objection other mode, any weight, competition reasons it. convention assemble first november next. sooner better. disorders too violent admit common lingering remedy. reasons which require vested plenipotentiary authority, are, business suffer delay execution; may, reality, come effect. convention agree upon confederation: states, individually, hardly ever will. one all events, vigorous one, mean succeed contest, happy hereafter. said before, engage states comply mode, congress confess them, plainly unanimously, impracticability supporting affairs present footing, without solid coercive union. ask, convention power vesting whole, part, unoccupied lands congress; because necessary body some property, fund arrangements finance; know other kind given them. confederation, opinion, give congress complete sovereignty; except part internal police, which relates rights property life among individuals, raising money internal taxes. necessary every thing belonging this, regulated state legislatures. congress complete sovereignty all relates war, peace, trade, finance; management foreign affairs; right declaring war; raising armies, officering, paying them, directing motions every respect; equipping fleets, same them; building fortifications, arsenals, magazines, etc., etc.; making peace such conditions think proper; regulating trade, determining countries carried on; granting indulgencies; laying prohibitions all articles export, import; imposing duties; granting bounties premiums raising, exporting, importing, applying own use, product duties; only giving credit states whom raised, general account revenues expenses; instituting admiralty courts, etc.; coining money; establishing banks such terms, such privileges, think proper; appropriating funds, whatever else relates operations finance; transacting every thing foreign nations; making alliances, offensive defensive; treaties commerce, etc., etc. confederation provide certain perpetual revenues, productive, easy collection; land tax, poll tax, like; which, together duties trade, unlocated lands, give congress substantial existence, stable foundation schemes finance. more supplies necessary, occasionally demanded states, present mode quotas. second step recommend, is, congress instantly appoint following great officers state. secretary foreign affairs, president war, president marine, financier, president trade. instead last, board trade preferable, regulations trade slow gradual; require prudence experience more than other qualities; which boards very well adapted. congress choose offices, men first abilities, property, character, continent; such best opportunities acquainted several branches. general schuyler, whom mentioned, make excellent president war; general m’dougall very good president marine. mr. robert morris many things favor department finance. could, own personal influence, give great weight measures adopt. dare say men, equally capable, found other departments. know not not good plan let financier president board trade; only casting voice determining questions there. there connection between trade finance, which make director one acquainted other; financier not direct affairs trade, because, sake acquiring reputation increasing revenues, adopt measures depress trade. relates finance, alone. officers nearly same powers functions france analogous them: each chief department; subordinate boards, composed assistants, clerks, etc., execute orders. opinion, plan kind inconceivable utility affairs: benefits very speedily felt. give new life energy operations government. business conducted dispatch, method, system. million abuses, now existing, corrected; judicious plans formed executed public good. another step immediate necessity, is, recruit army war, least three years. done mode similar which practised sweden. there inhabitants thrown into classes sixteen; sovereign wants men, each classes furnish one. raise fixed sum money; one class willing become soldier, receives money offers himself volunteer. none found this, draught made; whom lot falls, receives money, obliged serve. minds people prepared thing kind. heavy bounties obliged pay men serve few months, disgusted mode, made desirous another, will, once all, answer public purposes, obviate repetition demand. ought, all means, attempted; congress frame general plan, press execution upon states. confederation comes framed, provide fundamental law; hereafter there doubt success. cannot now wait this. want replace men whose times service expire first january: then, without this, army remaining; enemy please. general, letter already quoted, assigned most substantial reasons paying immediate attention point. congress endeavor, both upon credit europe, every possible exertion country, provide clothing officers; abolish whole system state supplies. making good depreciation currency, all other compensations army, immediately taken up congress, not left states. accounts depreciation liquidated, governmental certificates given due, specie, equivalent specie, give satisfaction; appointing periodical settlements future depreciation. placing officers upon half-pay during life, great stroke policy; give congress stronger tie upon than any thing else do. man, reflects moment, prefer permanent provision kind any temporary compensation. nor opposed economy: difference between this, between already done, insignificant. benefit widows confined whose husbands die during war. survivors, not more than one half, usual calculation men’s lives, exceed seven years which half-pay already established. beside this, whatever visionary speculations some men time, find indispensable, after war, keep foot considerable body troops: all officers, retained purpose, deducted out half-pay list. any one take pains calculate expense principles, am persuaded find addition expense, establishment proposed, means national object. advantages securing attachment army congress, binding service substantial ties, immense. then discipline; army reality, well name. congress then solid basis authority consequence: for, me, axiom, constitution, army essential american union. providing supplies, pivot every thing else (though well-constituted army would, not small degree, conduce this, giving consistency weight government). there four ways, all which united: foreign loan; heavy pecuniary taxes; tax kind; bank founded public private credit. foreign loan, dare say congress every thing power obtain it. most effectual way tell france, that, without it, make terms great britain. done plainness firmness; respect, without petulance; not menace, candid declaration circumstances. need not fear deserted france. interest honor too deeply involved fate; make possible compromise. assist us, convinced absolutely necessary; either lending us, herself, becoming surety, influencing spain. astonishing, any man doubted, any period affairs, necessity foreign loan. self-evident, not fund wealth country capable affording revenues equal expenses. then create artificial revenues, borrow. first done; foreseen expedient not last, provided time failure. here error congress. good reason believe, measures not taken, earnest, early enough procure loan abroad. give honor, first outset, thought now, wished foreign loan; not only because foresaw essential, because considered tie upon nation which derived, mean prop cause europe. concerning necessity heavy pecuniary taxes, need say nothing; point which every body agreed. nor there any danger, product any taxes, raised way, overburthen people, exceed wants public. indeed, all paper circulation drawn annually into treasury, neither one nor other. tax kind, necessity results principle: money circulation not sufficient representative productions country; and, consequently, revenues, raised medium, competent representative part products country which bound contribute support public. public, therefore, obtain due, satisfy just demands, wants, call part products themselves. done all countries which not commercial: russia, prussia, denmark, sweden, etc., peculiarly necessary case. congress, calling specific supplies, seem view; intention not answered. states, general, undertaken furnish supplies purchase; mode, observed, attended every inconvenience, subverting principle which supplies demanded; insufficiency circulating medium representative labor commodities country. therefore necessary congress more explicit; form outlines plan tax kind, recommend states measure absolute necessity. general idea plan, is, respectable man appointed state, each county, collect taxes form magazines; congress have, each state, officer superintend whole; state collectors subordinate responsible them. continental superintendent subject general direction quarter-master-general, not, deemed best; not subject him, obliged make monthly returns president war, who instruct him proportion deliver quarter-master-general. necessary, superintendents sometimes power dispose articles possession, public account; happen, contributions, places remote army, not transported theatre operations without too great expense; which case eligible dispose them, purchase, money raised, countries near immediate scene war. know objections which raised plan; tendency discourage industry, like. necessity calls it. cannot proceed without it: less evils give place greater. is, besides, practised success other countries, not this? said, examples cited nations under despotic governments; same not practicable us. contend, public good evidently object, more effected governments like ours, than any other. constant remark, free countries ever paid heaviest taxes. obedience free people general laws, however hard bear, ever more perfect than slaves arbitrary prince. added, sweden always free government; now, great degree, notwithstanding late revolution. far practicable erect bank joint credit public individuals, only certainly determined experiment. much importance, experiment fully tried. saw subscriptions going bank established supplying army, hopes only embryo more permanent extensive establishment. reason believe disappointed. not seem all conducted true principles bank. directors purchasing stock, instead bank notes, expected: consequence which, turn out mere subscription particular sum money particular purpose. paper credit never long supported any country, national scale, not founded joint basis public private credit. attempt establish public credit alone, france, under auspices mr. law, nearly ruined kingdom. seen effects america; every successive experiment, proves futility attempt. new money depreciating almost fast old; though has, some states, real funds paper money ever had. reason is, moneyed men not immediate interest uphold credit. even, many ways, find interest undermine it. only certain manner obtain permanent paper credit, engage moneyed interest immediately it, making contribute whole, part stock, giving whole, part profits. invention banks, modern principle, originated venice. there public, company moneyed men, mutually concerned. bank england unites public authority faith private credit: hence see, vast fabric paper credit raised visionary basis. not this, england never found sufficient funds carry wars: but, help this, done, doing, wonders. bank amsterdam similar foundation. not american bank? moneyed men less enlightened own interest, less enterprising pursuit? believe fault government, which not exert itself engage such scheme. true, individuals america not very rich; not prevent instituting bank; only prevent done such ample funds other countries. not sufficient confidence government, issue cause? let government endeavor inspire confidence, adopting measures recommended, others equivalent them. let exert itself procure solid confederation; establish good plan executive administration; form permanent military force; obtain, all events, foreign loan. things train vigorous execution, give new spring affairs; government recover respectability, individuals renounce diffidence. object propose myself, first instance, bank, auxiliary mode supplies; which purpose, contracts made, between government bank, terms liberal advantageous latter. every thing done, first instance, encourage bank. after gets well established, take care itself; government make best terms can, itself. first step establishing bank, engage number moneyed men influence relish project, make business. subscribers lately established, fittest persons found; plan interwoven. outlines plan be, open subscriptions all states; stock, which suppose one million pounds. real property every kind, well specie, deemed good stock; least fourth part subscription specie, plate. there one great company, three divisions: virginia, philadelphia, boston; two philadelphia boston. bank right issue bank notes, bearing two per cent. interest, whole stock; not exceed it. notes payable every three months, oftener: faith government pledged support bank. therefore right, time time, inspect operations, appoint inspectors purpose. advantages bank consist this: profits contracts made government, which bear interest annually paid specie; loan money interest, say six per cent.; purchasing lives annuities, practised england, etc. benefit resulting company, evident consideration, employ, circulation, great deal more money than specie stock, credit real property which other use. money employed, either fulfilling contracts public, which also gain profit; loans advantageous interest, annuities. bank allowed purchase plate bullion, coin money; allowing government part profit. make bank notes bear interest, obtain readier currency, induce holders prefer specie, prevent too great run upon bank, any time, beyond ability pay. government obtain foreign loan, lend bank, easy terms, extend influence, facilitate compliance engagements. government engage states raise sum money specie, deposited bank same manner, greatest consequence. government prevail enthusiasm people, make contribution plate same purpose, master-stroke. things kind sometimes succeed popular contests; and, undertaken address, not despair success: not sanguine. bank instituted term years way trial; particular privilege coining money, term still shorter. temporary transfer particular company, inconvenience, government condition improve resource; nor it, circumstances, object them; though, industry knot individuals, valuable one them. bank kind, even commencement, answer most valuable purposes government proprietors: progress, advantages exceed calculation. promote commerce, furnishing more extensive medium, which greatly want, circumstances. mean more extensive valuable medium. enormous nominal one time, only name. present unsettled state things country, hardly draw inferences happened others; otherwise certain success scheme: think enough favor worthy trial. only skimmed surface different subjects introduced. plans recommended come into contemplation, earnest, desire further thoughts, endeavor give more form particularity. am persuaded solid confederation, permanent army, reasonable prospect subsisting it, give treble consideration europe, produce peace winter. convention called, minds all states, people, prepared receive determinations sensible popular writings, which conform views congress. there epochs human affairs _novelty_ even useful. general opinion prevails old way bad, whether true false, obstructs relaxes operations public service, change necessary, sake change. exactly case now. ’tis universal sentiment, present system bad one, things not go right account. measure convention revive hopes people, give new direction passions, which improved carrying points substantial utility. eastern states already pointed out mode congress: take hint anticipate others. and, future, dear sir, two things let recommend, fundamental rules conduct congress: attach army every motive; maintain air authority (not domineering) all measures states. manner which thing done, more influence than commonly imagined. men governed opinion: opinion much influenced appearances realities. government appears confident own powers, surest way inspire same confidence others. diffident, certain there still greater diffidence others; authority not only distrusted, controverted, contemned. wish, too, congress always consider, kindness consists much manner thing. best things done hesitatingly, ill grace, lose effect, produce disgust rather than satisfaction gratitude. congress any time done army, commonly too late. seemed yield importunity, rather than sentiments justice regard accommodation troops. attention idea, more importance than thought. i, who seen all workings progress present discontents, am convinced, want not among most inconsiderable causes. perceive, dear sir, letter hastily written, confidential freedom: not member congress, whose feelings sore prevailing clamors; friend, who situation remedy public disorders; who wishes nothing much truth; who desirous information, even less capable judging than himself. not even time correct copy; only enough add, am, very truly affectionately, dear sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. schuyler hamilton. 1780. dear sir: favor 17th received day. 13th taken tour albany delivered moment. commissioners appointed meet eastern convention; believe judge hubbard, mr. benson, attorney general, myself, go; two gentlemen mentioned deeply impressed men necessity more power directing councils, better present situation, ----. lower house it, upper timid, although heartily disposed every measure which give vigor. too much indisposed undertake journey hartford, continue much am obliged quit before legislature rises. am informed gates thanks senate not despairing commonwealth, not mean tread wholly steps romans, confine him subordinate commands; potent army, drive cornwallis crew into sea more rapidity than flew hillsborough. pray entreat general gentlemen family accept best wishes, which always partake. am, dear sir, affectionately yours, etc., p. schuyler. col. hamilton. hamilton miss schuyler. september 6, 1780. most people here groaning under very disagreeable piece intelligence just come southward, gates total defeat near camden, south carolina. cornwallis met night fifteenth, accident, marching same point. advanced guards skirmished, two armies halted formed till morning. morning battle ensued, which militia, gates them, immediately ran away, left continental troops contend enemy’s whole force. obstinately, probably most cut off. gates, however, who writes congress, seems know very little become army. showed age long labors fatigues military life not least impaired activity, three days half reached hillsborough, one hundred eighty miles scene action, leaving all troops take care themselves, get out scrape well could. confirmed, instance, opinion always him. event very serious consequences southward. people’s imaginations already given up north carolina virginia; not believe either fall. am certain virginia cannot. misfortune affects less than others, because not temper repine evils past, endeavor draw good out them, because think safety depends total change system, change system only produced misfortune. a. hamilton. hamilton duane. september 6, 1780. dear sir: letter accompanying lain two three days want opportunity. heard since gates’s defeat: very good comment necessity changing system. passion militia, fancy, little cured, cease think best bulwark american liberty. think conduct great man? am enemy personally, unjust unprovoked attacks upon character; therefore say him received enemy, more weight than consistent fact common sense. ever any one hear such disposition such flight? best troops placed side strongest nature, worst weakest nature, attack made these. ’tis impossible give more complete picture military absurdity. equally against maxims war common sense. see consequences. left ran away, left right uncovered. right wing turned left all probability cut off. though, truth, general seems known very little became army. placed militia right, supported morass, continental troops left, seems most vulnerable, right more secure, left opposed enemy; instead going backward ordered attack, gone forward. reverse happened happened. there ever instance general running away, gates done, whole army? there ever precipitous flight? one hundred eighty miles three days half. admirable credit activity man time life. disgraces general soldier. always believed him very far short hector, ulysses. all world, think, begin agree me. done congress? changed not? changed, god’s sake overcome prejudice, send greene. know opinion him. stake reputation events, give him fair play. but, above all things, let have, without delay, vigorous, government, well constituted army war. adieu, dear sir, a. hamilton. col. fleury hamilton. boston, september 7, 1780. write me, direct letters general heath, under cover. cannot tell till see you; want much. enemy left martha’s vineyard. reported sailed southward. beg remember friend laurens; written him, keeps silent. not like situation lee’s fort: throw glove clinton; take it, not near enough seconds. sick increase; not much; increase. farewell, servant friend, f y. hamilton laurens. september, 1780. since return hartford, dear laurens, mind too little ease permit write sooner. wholly occupied affecting tragic consequences arnold’s treason. feelings never put severe trial. doubt heard principal facts before reaches you. there particulars, which situation gave access, cannot come knowledge public report, which am persuaded find interesting. several circumstances, project seems originated arnold himself, long premeditated. first overture traced back some time june last. conveyed letter colonel robinson; substance which was, ingratitude experienced country, concurring other causes, entirely changed principles; now only sought restore himself favor king, some signal proof repentance; happy open correspondence sir henry clinton purpose. about period made journey connecticut: return which philadelphia, solicited command west point; alleging effects wounds disqualified him active duties field. sacrifice important post atonement intended make. general washington hesitated less gratify officer who rendered such eminent services, convinced post safely intrusted one who given many distinguished specimens bravery. beginning august joined army renewed application. enemy, juncture, embarked greatest part forces expedition rhode island; army motion compel relinquish enterprise, attack new-york weakened state. general offered arnold left wing army, which declined, pretext already mentioned, not without visible embarrassment. certainly executed duties such temporary command; expected enterprising temper, gladly embraced splendid opportunity. not choose diverted moment favorite object; probably apprehension some different disposition taken place, which excluded him. extreme solicitude discovered get possession post, led suspicion treachery, possible, his past conduct, supposed him capable it. correspondence thus begun, carried between arnold major andré, adjutant-general british army, behalf sir henry clinton, under feigned signatures, mercantile disguise. intercepted letter arnold’s, which lately fell into hands, proposes interview, “to settle risks profits copartnership;” and, same style metaphor, intimates expected augmentation garrison; speaks means extending traffic. appears, another letter, andré met him lines, under sanction flag, character mr. john anderson. some cause other, not known, prevented interview. twentieth last month, robinson andré went up river vulture sloop-of-war. robinson sent flag arnold two letters; one general putnam, inclosed another himself; proposing interview putnam, or, his absence, arnold, adjust some private concerns. one general putnam, evidently meant cover other, case, accident, letters fallen under inspection third person. general washington crossed river, his way hartford, day dispatches arrived. arnold, conceiving heard flag, thought necessary, sake appearances, submit letters him, ask his opinion propriety complying request. general, his usual caution, though without least surmise design, dissuaded him it, advised him reply robinson, whatever related his private affairs, civil nature, only properly addressed civil authority. reference fortunately deranged plan; first link chain events led detection. interview longer take place form flag, obliged managed secret manner. arnold employed one smith go board vulture night twenty-second, bring andré shore, pass mr. john anderson. andré came ashore accordingly; conducted within picket ours house smith, arnold remained together close conference all night day following. daylight morning, commanding officer king’s ferry, without privity arnold, moved couple pieces cannon point opposite vulture lay, obliged take more remote station. event, some lurking distrust, made boatmen refuse convey two passengers back, disconcerted arnold much, one strokes infatuation which often confound schemes men conscious guilt, insisted andré’s exchanging his uniform disguise, returning mode different which came. andré, who undesignedly brought within posts first instance, remonstrated warmly against new dangerous expedient. arnold persisting declaring impossible him return came, length reluctantly yielded his direction, consented change his dress, take route recommended. smith furnished disguise, evening passed king’s ferry him, proceeded crompond, stopped remainder night, instance militia officer, avoid suspected him. next morning resumed journey, smith accompanying andré little beyond pine’s bridge, left him. reached tarrytown, taken up three militia men, who rushed out woods seized his horse. critical moment, his presence mind forsook him. instead producing his pass, which extricated him parties, done him harm his own, asked militia men, _upper_ _lower_ party; distinctive appellations known among enemy’s refugee corps. militia men replied, lower party; upon which told british officer, pressed not detain him, upon urgent business. confession removed all doubts; vain afterwards produced his pass. instantly forced off place greater security, where, after careful search, there found, concealed feet his stockings, several papers importance, delivered him arnold! among these, plan fortifications west point; memorial engineer attack defence place; returns garrison, cannon, stores; copy minutes council war held general washington few weeks before. prisoner, first, inadvertently ordered arnold; recollection, while still way, countermanded, sent old salem. papers inclosed letter general washington, which, taken route different which returned, made circuit afforded leisure another letter, through ill-judged delicacy, written arnold information anderson’s capture, get him hour before general washington arrived his quarters; time enough elude fate awaited him. went down river his barge vulture such precipitate confusion, not take him single paper useful enemy. first notice affair, pursued, much too late overtaken. there some color imagining part plan betray general into hands enemy. arnold very anxious ascertain him precise day his return; enemy’s movements seem corresponded point. really case, very injudicious. success depended surprise; officers advanced posts not secret, measures given alarm; general washington, taking command post, rendered whole scheme abortive. arnold, true, dispersed garrison, made defence difficult, not impracticable; acquisition west point such magnitude enemy, unwise connect any other object, however great, which make obtaining precarious. arnold, moment before setting out, went into mrs. arnold’s apartment, informed some transactions just come light, which ever banish him his country. fell into swoon declaration: left it, consult his own safety, till servants, alarmed cries, came relief. remained frantic all day; accusing every one who approached her, intention murder child (an infant arms); exhibiting every other mark most genuine agonizing distress. exhausted fatigue tumult spirits, phrensy subsided towards evening, sank into all sadness affliction. impossible not touched situation. every thing affecting female tears, misfortunes beauty; every thing pathetic wounded tenderness wife, apprehensive fondness mother; and, till reason change opinion, add, every thing amiable suffering innocence; conspired make object sympathy all who present. experienced most delicate attentions, every friendly office, till departure philadelphia. andré was, without loss time, conducted head quarters army, immediately brought before board general officers, prevent all possibility misrepresentation, cavil part enemy. board reported, considered spy, and, according laws nations, suffer death; which executed two days after. never, perhaps, any man suffer death more justice, deserve less. first step took, after his capture, write letter general washington, conceived terms dignity without insolence, apology without meanness. scope vindicate himself imputation assumed mean character treacherous interested purposes; asserting involuntarily impostor; contrary his intention, which meet person intelligence neutral ground, betrayed within posts, forced into vile condition enemy disguise; soliciting only, that, whatever rigor policy devote him, decency treatment observed, due person, who, though unfortunate, guilty nothing dishonorable. his request granted full extent; for, whole progress affair, treated most scrupulous delicacy. brought before board officers, met every mark indulgence, required answer interrogatory which even embarrass his feelings. his part, while carefully concealed every thing involve others, frankly confessed all facts relating himself; and, upon his confession, without trouble examining witness, board made report. members not more impressed candor firmness, mixed becoming sensibility, which displayed, than penetrated liberality politeness. acknowledged generosity behavior towards him every respect, particularly this, strongest terms manly gratitude. conversation gentleman who visited him after his trial, said flattered himself never illiberal; there any remains prejudice his mind, his present experience obliterate them. one visits made him (and saw him several times during his confinement), begged bearer request general, permission send open letter sir henry clinton. “i foresee fate,” said he, “and though pretend not play hero, indifferent about life; yet am reconciled whatever happen, conscious misfortune, not guilt, brought upon me. there only one thing disturbs tranquillity. sir henry clinton too good me; lavish his kindness. am bound him too many obligations, love him too well, bear thought, reproach himself, others reproach him, supposition conceived myself obliged, his instructions, run risk did. not, world, leave sting his mind imbitter his future days.” scarce finish sentence, bursting into tears spite his efforts suppress them; difficulty collected himself enough afterwards add: “i wish permitted assure him, not act under impression, submitted necessity imposed upon me, contrary own inclination his orders.” his request readily complied with; wrote letter annexed, which dare say much pleased am, both diction sentiment. his sentence announced him, remarked, since his lot die, there still choice mode, which make material difference his feelings; happy, possible, indulged professional death. made second application, letter, concise persuasive terms. thought indulgence, incompatible customs war, not granted; therefore determined, both cases, evade answer, spare him sensations which certain knowledge intended mode inflict. going place execution, bowed familiarly went along, all whom acquainted his confinement. smile complacency expressed serene fortitude his mind. arrived fatal spot, asked, some emotion, “must then die manner?” told unavoidable. “i am reconciled fate,” said he, “but not mode.” soon, however, recollecting himself, added: “it momentary pang:” and, springing upon cart, performed last offices himself, composure excited admiration, melted hearts beholders. upon told final moment hand, asked any thing say, answered, “nothing request witness world, die like brave man.” among extraordinary circumstances attended him, midst his enemies, died universally esteemed universally regretted. there something singularly interesting character fortunes andré. excellent understanding, well improved education travel, united peculiar elegance mind manners, advantage pleasing person. ’tis said possessed pretty taste fine arts, himself attained some proficiency poetry, music, painting. his knowledge appeared without ostentation, embellished diffidence rarely accompanies many talents accomplishments: which left suppose more than appeared. his sentiments elevated, inspired esteem: softness conciliated affection. his elocution handsome: his address easy, polite, insinuating. his merit, acquired unlimited confidence his general, making rapid progress military rank reputation. height his career, flushed new hopes execution project, most beneficial his party devised, once precipitated summit prosperity, saw all expectations his ambition blasted, himself ruined. character given him, drawn partly saw him myself, partly information. am aware man real merit never seen favorable light through medium adversity: clouds surround him, shades set off his good qualities. misfortune cuts down little vanities that, prosperous times, serve many spots his virtues; gives tone humility makes his worth more amiable. his spectators, who enjoy happier lot, less prone detract it, through envy, more disposed, compassion, give him credit deserves, perhaps even magnify it. speak not andré’s conduct affair philosopher, man world. authorized maxims practices war, satires human nature. countenance almost every species seduction well violence; general who make most traitors army his adversary, frequently most applauded. scale acquit andré; while not condemn him, examine his conduct sober rules philosophy moral rectitude. is, however, blemish his fame, once intended prostitute flag: about this, man nice honor scruple;

il ne demande pas mieux assurément que de le changer, il fait tous ses efforts pour cela, il frappe à toutes les portes, mais inutilement. il est bien aisé de faire de belles loix pour corriger les abus; tout le monde voit les abus, tout le monde peut se faire valoir en déclamant d’autre, mais déterminer, presque les circonstances permettent, de corriger l’abus, en supprimant des moyens abusifs de faire une chose en substituer d’autres voilà ce que les réformateurs croyans ne font pas toujours. vous expliquerez cela à qui il appartient, probablement vous ne vous tromperez pas, au fait dont je vous prie de donner à m. de villefranche un mot comme vous l’avez donné à m. de rochefontaine. je suis, mon cher colonel, dans une totale défaute de livres anglais; j’en ai réluqué un sur la table aujourd’hui, que le colonel harrison m’a dit que vous lisiez, mais je pense que vous ne lisez pas les deux volumes à la fois. si vous pouviez m’en prêter un, vous obligeriez beaucoup votre très humble serviteur. du portail. je vous prie de renvoyer les papiers en cachets. du portail. col. hamilton. la fayette hamilton. philadelphia, dec. 9, 1780. dear hamilton: arrival paramus, wrote letter general, which colonel gouvion deliver himself new windsor;

infinitely exceed apprehended. really carrying war enemy’s country; cannot establish most inconsiderable magazine, convey smallest quantity stores one post another, without obliged detach guards security. division among people much greater than imagined; whigs tories persecute each other little less than savage fury. there nothing murders devastations every quarter. loss our army charleston, defeat general gates, cause keeping such shoals militia foot; service accompanied such destruction loss, almost laid waste whole country. nothing more destructive true interest country than mode adopted defence. two misfortunes happening one after other, rendered unavoidable last season; continued, inhabitants inevitably ruined, resources country rendered incapable affording support army competent defence. government here infinitely more popular than northward; there such thing national character national sentiment. inhabitants all quarters globe, various opinions, projects, schemes, manners habits early education. office, vanity thought powerful, join measure imposing upon public respecting strength resources southern states: while congress, minister france, kept under fatal delusion, fear little support given department. inhabitants numerous; rather formidable abroad than home. scattered over such vast extent country, difficult collect, still more difficult subsist them. there great spirit enterprise among black people; come out volunteers not little formidable enemy. there are, also, some particular corps under sumpter, marion, clarke, bold daring; rest militia better calculated destroy provisions than oppose enemy. philadelphia, all journey through country, endeavored impress upon power, necessity sending clothing, supplies every kind, immediately army. poverty urged plea, bar every application. all promised fair, fear little: ability wanting some, inclination others. public credit totally lost, private people not give aid, though see themselves involved one common ruin. opinion general washington’s influence more than all assemblies upon continent. always thought him exceeding popular; many places little less than adored, universally admired. his influence country possibly effect something great. however, found myself exceedingly well received, more friend general, than own merit. country wants, defence, small well appointed army, organized move great celerity. consist about five thousand infantry, eight hundred thousand horse. enemy cannot maintain larger force quarter, neither we. resources country too small subsist large body troops any one point: draw supplies distance, through such long tracts barren land, next impossible, unless business aided water transportation; and, either case, accompanied amazing expense. get superiority horse, soon render difficult lord cornwallis hold his position far country. nor under any apprehensions, much inferior force his, taking post near him, such body horse. enemy’s horse much superior ours, cannot move detachment towards without hazarding ruin. came army, found most wretched condition. officers lost all confidence general, troops all discipline. troops not only lost discipline, addicted plundering terror country. general met least upon very civil terms;

basis something more perfect, contains any hints use you, trouble have taken myself, give you, not misapplied. any rate, confidence have judgment, assures receive, pleasure, communications sort: contain any thing useful, promote views public benefit; not, only evil trouble reading them; best informed frequently derive lights, even reveries projectors quacks. there scarcely any plan bad not have something good it. trust candor without further apology; least justice intention. first step towards determining done finances country, estimate, best manner can, capacity revenue; proportion between able afford, stands need of, expenses civil military establishments. there occur two ways doing this: 1st. examining proportion revenues other countries have borne stock wealth, applying rule ourselves, proper allowance difference circumstances. 2d. comparing result rule product taxes states which have most earnest taxation. reason recourse first method is, our own experience our faculties respect, not sufficiently clear, uniform, admit certain conclusion: more satisfactory judge general principle, drawn example other nations, compared have effected ourselves, than rely entirely upon latter. nations whose wealth revenues best acquainted, france, great britain, united provinces. real wealth nation, consisting labor commodities, estimated sign wealth--its circulating cash. there times when, particular accidents, quantity exceed fall short just representative; turn again proper level, and, general course things, maintain itself state. circulation france almost wholly carried precious metals; current cash estimated fifteen sixteen hundred millions livres. net revenue kingdom, sum which actually passes into public coffers, somewhere between three hundred sixty four hundred millions, about one fourth whole currency. estimate wealth nation liable less fallacy than other two, makes little use paper credit, which artificially increased, even supported, long time beyond natural bounds. supposed gross sum extracted people collectors revenue, one-third more than which goes into treasury: exactions excessive, fall too heavy particular orders, who means reduced indigence misery, inferred, that, moderate reasonable expenses collection, present revenue great kingdom well afford, present quantity wealth. circulating cash great britain, paper specie, stated about forty millions pounds sterling. mr. hume supposes have been, time wrote his essay balance trade, about thirty millions. other writers have carried fifty, probably medium shall find truth. not include this, whole amount bank notes, exchequer bills, india bonds, etc. etc.; only such part really employed common circulation, performs offices current cash. ’75, dr. price’s statement, net revenue great britain ten millions--that is, about one-fourth current cash, france. have never met any calculation depended upon, current cash seven provinces. almost whole coin, well large quantities plate bullion, shut up bank amsterdam. real wealth bank believed about fifteen millions sterling; though, upon strength fund, credit almost unlimited, answers all purposes cash trade. dutch, prudent maxims, have commonly rate exchange throughout europe favor, considerable balance trade, use paper credit (which, part, also depends upon particular nature banks) not same tendency them, england, banish precious metals. therefore suppose here, france, true sign wealth nation. fifteen millions bank, add two millions specie retail circulation various transactions business, shall, imagine, have nearly true stock wealth united provinces. revenues amount something more than four millions, bear same proportion stock which drawn, france england. confess, however, data, case, not sufficiently ascertained permit rely equally result. three examples venture deduce general rule,--that proportion revenue which nation capable affording, about one-fourth circulating cash, far just representative labor commodities. only applicable commercial countries, because, which not so, circulating cash not adequate sign. great part domestic commerce carried barter; state receive part dues labor commodities themselves. proportion, however, revenues such state aggregate labor commodities, same case trading nations circulating cash; difference, difficulty collection transportation, waste embezzlement inseparable mode revenue, make real advantage ultimate gain state, infinitely less than public dues paid cash. say one-fourth part stock wealth revenue which nation capable affording government, understood qualified, not absolute sense. presumptuous fix precise boundary ingenuity financiers, patience people: safely say, taxation already carried, nations have speaking of; extent which not admit very considerable increase without proportionable increase industry. suffices standard us; proceed application. comparison several estimates have seen, quantity current cash country previous war (specie paper), have settled opinion amount thirty millions dollars, which about eight have specie: one-fourth this, analogy, time proper revenue states; is, seven half millions dollars. taxation, however, has, slow gradations, carried extreme countries which have chosen examples, not be, course time, practicable this, people have little accustomed taxes, doubted whether possible raise same proportion revenue here. object war, imagine, supply want habit, reconcile minds people paying utmost abilities, provided taxes judiciously imposed, revenues wisely administered. besides this, there circumstance our favor, which puts power government raise equal proportion revenue without burthening lower classes people same degree europe. circumstance much greater equality fortunes, which means men, this country, made contribute public exigencies much juster proportion property; this fact case. france rich have gained entire ascendant, there constant sacrifice ease happiness people their avarice luxury: their burthens proportion middle order, still less poor. england holland case, though not altogether, great measure same. there also men very large moneyed capitals, which either formerly exempt taxes public funds, or, visible representative taxation operate upon, enjoy virtually same advantages. if, commencement war, ability states revenue rated seven half millions dollars, amount circulating cash thirty millions, now reduced more than one-half real value, revenue supposed equal this time? judge about one-fifth less, not more. diminution our circulating cash principally artificial. true, our foreign commerce declined war, our domestic commerce increased. know good reason believe, quantity labor commodities have materially diminished. our exports have lessened, our internal consumption augmented. men employed army, departments connected it, consume waste three times much same number men civil life. number husbandmen have taken their ploughs into military service; progress our natural population has, part, supplied their place; demands war have increased individual industry. great influx money, first operated upon avarice people, and, long time, served also stimulus industry, which taxation since kept up principle necessity. notwithstanding demands competitions two armies supplies, see corn, which staple middle states, cheaper than some years before war; strong argument plenty. infer all this, stand need now nearly same quantity medium our circulation before war. depreciation money below standard, attributed want confidence rather than decay resources. find people, some states, distressed pay their taxes, want money, ample means otherwise; which proof, our current cash not competent representative labor commodities country. another proof same nature is, particular states who have found small difficulty collecting their pecuniary taxes, have successful raising contributions large amount kind. this country never country manufactures, productions soil ever were, still are, principal source revenue. inhabitants have abridged their wants foreign articles, scarcity them, have, part, supplied their place home manufactures; which, chiefly conducted women, take nothing labor appropriated agriculture, while enables farmer spare larger portion his income public. whatever diminution our means revenue have suffered, accounted decay foreign trade, loss territory. imposts trade great britain amounted about fourth total revenue. proportion less america. suppose same; suppose our external commerce reduced one-half, which believe ample allowance, then, one-eighth be deducted our revenue this account; which bring down six millions, five hundred sixty-two thousand, five hundred dollars. allow loss georgia south carolina one-eighth this sum: this reduce income remaining states five millions, seven hundred forty-two thousand, one hundred eighty-eight, four-eighths, dollars. allowance, both cases, large, diminution have already supposed, one-fifth whole, appears be nearest truth; which leaves states net revenue six millions dollars. now examine far this rule agrees experience, already effected states. massachusetts serve criterion. this one states taxation carried furthest. taxes heavy last year, am informed there real marks distress among some classes people. legislature, their late address, tell amounted six hundred thousand pounds lawful: appear have thought pressure too great, reducing time obliged have recourse large loan, answer exigencies current year. taxes specify which seem belong present year, addition bounties raising men, beef supply, be estimated near five hundred thousand pounds. this state different situation any other. its position made impossible enemy intercept its trade; while all others greatly injured totally obstructed. become, consequence, mart states northward pennsylvania; its commerce enlarged itself much beyond its former limits. great part money expended support war, disbursed there. congress, their requisitions money, have rated quota massachusetts whole; believe its ability, this time, proportion one-fifth. found this estimation impartial comparison circumstances several states. admitting proportion be just, taking taxes present year standard, gross amount our collective revenues be two millions, five hundred thousand pounds lawful; eight millions, three hundred thirty-three thousand, three hundred thirty-three, one-third, dollars. expense collection, england, about ninth gross amount; considering our revenue be raised eleven different governments, each complete set collectors its own, expense collection, us, all probability be not much less than england. supposing be same, taxes prove productive their nominal amount, our net revenue then be seven millions, four hundred seven thousand, four hundred eight, one-half, dollars; which considerably exceeds be first calculation. there considerations which induce make large deductions this sum. legislature tells us, taxes last year amounted six hundred thousand pounds, also tells there _a part_ still be levied; which, among other things, occasioned postpone next tax future session. whatever due last year, be considered, effect, anticipation taxes present; takes off much ability people pay them. chances are, additional impositions projected current year not be raised their full extent. taxes seldom never productive their estimated value; case like this, be expected be more than commonly deficient. be observed, also, last year year peculiar exertion. there general expectation some attempt, conjunction our allies, decisive war. this made people strain their efforts beyond their natural abilities: yet not comply demands legislature. money bounties this year, which have calculated sixty thousand pounds,[12] may, like manner, be regarded extraordinary special contribution, which people be willing submit to, over above probably afford pay, get rid insupportable inconvenience temporary enlistments. reasonable deductions accounts made, bring two calculations pretty exact agreement, make confirm each other. not this case, be inclined, preference, trust first, founded basis better known better ascertained experience. believe, however, safely conclude, both, between six seven millions dollars proper revenue states, after dismemberment south carolina georgia. formed estimate our ability revenue, next thing be ascertained is, annual expense our civil military establishments. tolerable economy, suppose two millions half dollars amply suffice first, including particular administration each state. second, judiciously managed, eight millions dollars be adequate, calculating army twenty thousand men, which many shall stand need of, be able[13] raise. eleven millions dollars be then amount annual expenses states. speak supposition system embraced, well adapted rescuing our affairs chaos which now involved; which, while continues, baffle all calculation. difference between our revenues expenses, preceding scale, be four four half millions dollars; which deficiency course be supplied credit, foreign domestic, both. regard credit abroad, think have little chance obtaining sufficiency, nearly answer our purpose. france, all reforms make interior economy, all means procure loans lotteries, addition revenue, little more than satisfy own wants. death empress queen, notorious hostility emperor, add number these. will, all probability, be obliged pay greater attention her army, which neglected, several years past, apply all resources kingdom improvement navy. though russia prussia, last advices, seemed disposed control ill-humor emperor, france hardly think prudent leave herself defenceless condition, relying precarious friendship momentary interests other powers. increase her army necessarily increase her expenses, cannot, present state things, retrench any thing navy; course have less money spare allies. observed, france hitherto imposed none additional taxes usual time war; doing which, imagined have her power, not only supply her own wants better, contribute largely ours. this answered, great appearance reason, credit financier very much depends his such resource reserve, which, considered mean command, necessary, fulfil his engagements, disposes moneyed men lend him greater freedom confidence. breaking upon resource, therefore (it said), injure credit, obstruct loans degree not be compensated direct value revenue furnish. upon whole, however, variety siftings inquiries, be mistaken france not lend this country eight ten millions livres annually, during war; provided its finances once put upon reasonable footing: this not above third our wants. find reason flatter ourselves have much expect either ability inclination spain. her government far rich vulgarly imagined. mines south america, late years, have less liberal their profits; and, fear accidents, small part their product, since war, imported into europe. extreme indolence spaniards, their neglect agriculture, manufactures, trade, make tributary their more industrious neighbors, who drain their precious metals fast arrive. heartily disposed it, still afford some assistance. their conduct, hitherto, manifested such disposition: cold reserved well be. bills drawn upon have not rejected, have not paid. their permitting residence british emissary among them, countenance give him, unprecedented state war, afford just room distrust their intentions, though be nothing more than stroke policy, play him off against our negotiations, make bid higher their friendship. their method prosecuting war passive, degree scarcely be resolved even into spanish supineness;

not without enlightened respectable opponents. all said against them, only tends prove that, like all other good things, subject abuse, and, abused, become pernicious. precious metals, similar arguments, be proven be injurious. certain mines south america have great influence banishing industry spain, sinking real wealth importance. great power, commerce, riches, or, other words, great national prosperity, may, like manner, be denominated evils;

public have temptation overstrain its credit. opinion, not hesitate, because have other resource. long expensive wars king william, drained england its specie: its commerce began droop want proper medium: its taxes unproductive, its revenues declined. administration wisely recourse institution bank; relieved national difficulties. same, still greater, want sufficient medium. have little specie: paper have small value, rapidly descending less: immersed war our existence nation, our liberty happiness people: have revenues nor credit. bank, practicable, only thing give either one other. besides great cardinal motives such institution, advantages enjoy it, common other nations, our situation, relatively europe west indies, give some peculiar advantages. nothing more common than men pass abuse good thing, disuse it. some persons, disgusted depreciation money, chimerical enough imagine be beneficial abolish all paper credit, annihilate whole now circulation, depend altogether upon our specie, both commerce finance. scheme altogether visionary, attempt be fatal. have not competent stock specie this country, either answer purposes circulation trade, serve basis revenue. whole amount have, am persuaded, not exceed six millions dollars, one-fifth circulating medium before war. suppose this be sufficient operations commerce, be suppose our domestic foreign commerce both reduced four-fifths: supposition carries absurdity face it. follows our paper money destroyed, great part transactions traffic be carried barter; mode inconvenient, partial, confined, destructive both commerce industry. addition paper now have, this evil exists too great degree. respect revenue, whole our specie be drawn into public treasury annually, have seen be little more than one half our annual expense. this be impracticable; never effected any country. numerary country sufficient representative, there only certain proportion be drawn out daily circulation; because, without necessary quantity cash, stagnation business ensue. small, then, be proportion six millions (in itself unequal representative) which public be able extract revenue. either have little revenue, receive its dues kind; inefficacy inconveniences which mode, have already remarked. necessity it, part, unhappily now place, cause assigned, deficiency current cash: establish our principal dependence, be impossible contrive mode less productive public, more contrary the habits inclinations the people, more baneful industry. waiving the objections this head, there still remain balance four millions dollars more than states furnish revenue, which be provided the yearly expense the war. this be procured without paper credit, supply the deficiency specie, enable the moneyed men lend? this question, apprehend, be easy solution. the present system things, the health state, particularly commercial one, depends due quantity regular circulation cash, much the health animal body depends upon the due quantity regular circulation the blood. there indisputable indications have not sufficient medium; have continual fluctuation. the only cure our public disorders, fix the value the currency now have, increase proper standard, species have the requisite stability. the error those who explode paper money altogether, originates not making proper distinctions. our paper was, its nature, liable depreciation, because funds its support, not upheld private credit. the emissions under the resolution march, ’80, have partly the former advantage, destitute the latter, which equally essential. paper credit be substantial, durable, which not funds, which not unite, immediately, the interest influence the moneyed men, its establishment preservation. credit begun this basis, will, process time, greatly exceed its funds: this requires time, well settled opinion its favor. ’tis national bank, alone, find the ingredients constitute wholesome, solid, beneficial paper credit. am aware that, the present temper men’s minds, be easy task inspire relish project this kind: much depend the address personal credit the proposer. hands not despair: have the greater hopes am informed appeared be the disposition, the promulgation the plan loan massachusetts. the men property america, enlightened about their own interest, easily be brought see the advantages good plan. not be discouraged happened heretofore, behold the administration our finances put into better channel. the violations public engagements, hitherto, have proceeded more necessity produced ignorance mismanagement, than levity disregard the obligations good faith. the success, the first instance, not be complete the extent the plan requires, this not hinder its undertaken. the nature bank, wisely instituted, wisely administered, extend itself, and, small beginnings, grow magnitude not have foreseen. the plan propose, requires stock three millions pounds, lawful money; one-half the sum be obtained, entertain doubt its full success. now remains submit plan, which rather offer outline, than finished plan. contains, however, the general principles. each article, opposite column, shall affix explanatory remark. art i. bank be remark 1. the second article, erected stock three part the stock be landed millions pounds, lawful security: this, the whole be money, the rate six exempted taxes. here be shillings dollar, divided considerable saving the proprietor, into thirty thousand shares. which be estimated among the clear this stock be exempted profits the bank. this indeed all public taxes be small reduction the public impositions whatsoever. revenue; the loss be little consequence, compared the advantages be derived the bank. art ii. subscription remark 2. admitting landed be opened the amount security part the bank stock, the stock. subscriber while establish solid funds the one share five, money emitted, the same time advance the whole specie. supply the defect specie, give subscriber six shares strong inducement moneyed men fifteen advance one-half advance their money; because, not only specie, the other half good the money actually deposited be landed security. subscriber employed their benefit, but, the sixteen shares, upwards, credit their landed security, the advance two-sixths seventh article, be raised equal specie, one-sixth bills amount cash, be also employed securities good european their benefit: which artifice funds, three-sixths good have the use their land (exempted, landed security. either case too, taxes), the use the specie, plate bullion, value representative cash. given value, proportioned this consists capital advantage the its quality, be bank the proprietors. a, instance, substituted;

which employ loans, profitable contracts, beneficial purchases, discounting bills exchange, the other methods permitted the subsequent articles. besides all this, the bank notes have once acquired fixed credit, not obliged keep his six hundred pounds, deposited specie, idle: he lend, otherwise improve, part also. advantages not exist their full extent first, soon succeed each other. art. iii. the bank remark 3. this article needs be erected into legal illustration. corporation; have all the powers immunities requisite its security, the recovery its debts, the disposal its property. art. iv. the stock remark 4. the first part the bank not be liable this regulation necessary engage any attachment seizure foreigners trust their property the whatsoever; but, refusal bank; the latter part give idea payment, the holders bank security the holders bank notes. notes, bonds, enter suit against any member, members, the corporation; and, far their respective shares the bank extend, recover the debt, cost damages, out their private property. art. v. the united remark 5. this link the states, any particular interests the public more intimately states, foreigners, the bank, be easy method become subscribers the bank, acquiring revenue. also participate its profits, facilitate the making up its stock the any sums not exceeding the loans which congress obtain abroad; whole half the stock. without which be more difficult raise large sum. essential the stock be large, because, proportion it, be the credit the bank, course its ability lend enlarge its paper emissions. the admission foreigners also assist the completing the stock; probable many be induced enter into the plan, especially after made some progress among ourselves, obtained degree consistency. the sum limited one half the stock, because primary importance the moneyed men among ourselves be deeply interested the plan. art. vi. the united remark 6. this mode pledging states, collectively the public faith, makes difficult particularly, become be infringed possibly responsible all the be devised. our situation transactions the bank, expedient offer every appearance conjointly the private security. foreigners more firmly proprietors. persuaded the establishment our independence than the continuance our union; therefore have more confidence the states bound separately than collectively. individuals among ourselves be influenced similar considerations. art vii. the bank remark 7. the reason issue notes payable sight, payable sight, inspire pounds, shillings, the greater confidence give pence, lawful: all twenty readier currency: nor do apprehend shillings, under, bear there be any danger it. interest: all above, the beginning some be carried the bear interest not exceeding bank payment, finding four per cent. the notes be punctually discharged, the applications many denominations cease. the notes payable be judged convenient pounds, shillings, pence, rather circulation, two kinds; than dollars, produce illusion one payable only america, the minds the people favorable the other payable either the new paper; rather prevent american part their transferring their europe the bank have prejudices against the old. paper credit funds. the aggregate depends much opinion, opinion notes never exceed the bank often guided outside appearances. stock. circumstance trivial this seem, have small influence the popular imagination. 20s., under, without interest, because such small sums be diffused the lesser transactions daily circulation, there be less probability their carried the bank payment. the interest the larger notes calculated give preference specie, prevent run upon the bank. the notes, however, be introduced degrees, not inundate the public once. those bearing interest not be multiplied too much first; the interest abridgment the profits the bank, after the notes have gained unequivocal credit, be advantageous issue large proportion the smaller ones. first, the interest best be four per cent., operate the more effectually motive: afterwards, the new notes, be gradually diminished: always be expedient let bear interest not less than two per cent. the making some the notes payable europe well america, necessary enable the bank avail itself its funds there: also serve raise the demand bank notes, rendering useful foreign commerce, the promoting which further inducement. the limiting the aggregate the notes the amount the stock, necessary obviate suspicion their multiplied beyond the means redemption. art. viii. the bank remark 8. the beginning lend money the public, be the advantage the bank individuals, interest not require high interest, because money exceeding eight per cent. great demand, the bank itself want the principal part its cash the loans stipulated article xiii, performing the contracts authorized article xii: the profits not, some time, turn materially the principle loans, except the public. the contracts cease, the bank find its advantage lending, moderate interest, secure preference borrowers, which will, the same time, promote commerce; kind mutual reaction, the bank assist commerce, commerce assist the bank. art. ix. the bank remark 9. this precaution have liberty borrowing, against sudden run. borrow the best terms can, the proportion pays. amount one half its stock. another advantage: particular conjunctures the bank borrow low interest, lend, others, higher. art. x. the bank remark 10. this privilege have liberty purchasing purchasing estates be very estates principal, valuable one. watching favorable annuities; the power coining opportunities, large capital, the amount half its vast property be acquired this stock, the quantity alloy, way. there be fine opening etc., determined the conclusion the war. many persons congress; also the power disaffected our independence, who discounting bills exchange. have rendered themselves odious without becoming obnoxious the laws, be disposed sell their estates here, either their whole value, annuities europe. the power coining[15] necessary, plate, bullion, admitted instead specie; be, particular occasions, expedient coin them; this be small resource the bank. the power discounting bills exchange be considerable one. its advantages consist purchasing, taking up the honor the drawer, the security good, bills exchange much per cent. discount. large profit be now made this way the bills drawn france; hereafter, times peace, commerce comes flourish, this practice promote the transactions the several states each other, europe, be very profitable the bank. art. xi. the bank remark 11. this imitation receive individuals, the bank amsterdam. individuals deposits any sums money, once get into the practice depositing be repaid called for, their money bank, give credit passed, order, the the bank, assist trade. time, credit others; deposits premium be required repayment plate, paying certain holland. small profit be annual rate safe keeping. immediately gained plate, the whatever deposited the states begin tax this article; bank, be exempt taxes. many persons dispense this time the use their plate, deposit place safety, pay less keeping than the tax. whatever serves increase the apparent wealth the bank, enhance its credit! even be useful let the owners the plate have credit bank the value the plate, estimated scale make the advantage the bank purchase. art. xii. the bank remark 12. be have right contract great importance the success the the french government the subscriptions, previous assurance supply its fleets armies contracts take place: _america_, contract the profits be trifling congress the supply inducement adventurers; have their armies. the air employing the money subscribed trade. soon, therefore, the plan be resolved upon, negotiations be begun the purpose. clearly the interest the french government enter into contracts, be blind not do it, especially proposed under the aspect method re-establishing our finances. the present loss their bills enormous. the bank engage receive moderate discount, supply better terms than now make. their business this time trusted variety hands, some which neither very skilful nor very honest: competitions, frauds, additional expense, the consequences. congress not hesitate their parts, the amount the contracts be part the loan required article xiii. art. xiii. the bank remark 13. this loan lend congress one million, enable congress get through the two hundred thousand pounds, expenses the year. there be lawful, eight per cent. small deficiency, this be easily interest; the payment supplied. the credit the bank once which, its interest, established, increase its stock, certain unalienable fund one lend equal sum every year during hundred ten thousand, four the war. this loan be advanced, hundred pounds per annum, be partly contract provisions, established twenty years. clothing, etc., partly cash, the states, generally periodical payments, avoid too quick severally, pledge themselves multiplication bank notes. this sum, the due appropriation the fund. congress have right, any intermediate period, pay off the debt, the interest the time payment. the same rule govern all future loans. art. xiv. the bank remark 14. the greatest become responsible the importance the old currency redemption all the paper be fixed certain value, there now emitted; the old, forty be danger its infecting the one thirty years, the future paper: besides, want raise new par, gold point make approach silver, according the terms nearer adequate medium. have promised congress their chosen the resolution march, ’80, resolution march, ’80. standard. not, any account, one-third the first be raise the value the old paper redeemed the end every higher than forty one, this ten years; the whole give about the degree value the last be redeemed the most salutary; the same time expiration the six years avoid second breach faith, specified congress, the which cause violent death interest five per cent. the all future credit. stable currency united states, compensation idea fundamental all practicable this responsibility, schemes finance. the duty establish certain funds interest the public give stability annuity, payable the bank, which now exists; be equal the discharge the the interest the bank, which alone whole amount the paper effect it, co-operate. have currency thirty years, not mentioned the amount the annuity interest two per cent. be paid congress, because have per annum. not materials judge quantity paper money now exists; since be necessary take all the state emissions into the calculation. suppose (including state emissions) there be about four hundred millions dollars the old standard, about four millions the new.[16] this give us, specie-value, about fourteen millions dollars. this the bank become answerable for, the public pay, annuity thirty years, two per cent. interest. this annuity amount six hundred eleven thousand, three hundred thirty-three, one-third, dollars, which funds be provided. rough calculation, find the bank gain, the thirty years, about three millions dollars, the simple footing interest; will, different periods, have more public money its possession, than be advance others: that, upon the whole, the sum gain interest, be the loan its credit the public, not any specific sum cash. besides, the interest the bank gain very considerable sum the purchases make the old paper its current value, before the influence this plan time bring back the point which intended be fixed.[17] the obvious interest the united states concur this plan, because, paying three millions dollars interest the bank, more than have pay the money-holders, agreeably its present engagements, avoid new breach faith, fix its circulating medium increased value more than one-half, render the taxes more productive, introduce order into its finances, without which our independence lost. also have only about two-thirds the funds establish this plan required the act march, ’80, discharge the new bills: will, course, reserve large balance towards the current expenses, which insignificant consideration. perhaps be imagined, the same funds established the redemption the money the same time, without passing through the bank, have equal effect upon its credit, then save the interest two per cent. experience proves the contrary. find the new notes depreciating the states which have provided good funds. the truth is, there not confidence enough any funds merely public. the responsibility the bank beget much stronger persuasion the paper redeemed, have incomparably more efficacy raising confirming its credit. besides, the bank immediately reduce the quantity purchase, which the public not do. be observed, the six millions dollars which constitute our annual revenue, require nine hundred seventy-nine thousand, three hundred thirty-three, one-third, dollars, funds, reimburse the loan the first year, pay off the annuity the redemption the old paper. be asked, funds be procured the present impotence our federal government. answer, there ample means them, be had. congress deal plainly their constituents. tell them, power without revenue bubble; unless give substantial resources the latter, not have enough the former, either prosecute the war, maintain the union peace; that, short, must, justice the public their own honor, renounce the vain attempt carrying the war without either; perseverance which, only deceive the people, betray their safety. demand instant, positive, perpetual investiture impost trade; land tax, poll tax, be collected their own agents. this act become part the confederation. ever opinion congress have complete sovereignty all the mere municipal law each state; wish see convention all the states, full power alter amend, finally irrevocably, the present futile senseless confederation. the taxes specified, be made amount three millions dollars; the other three millions be raised requisition, heretofore. art. xv. the bank remark 15. essential notes be received payment all taxes be raised, throughout all public customs the united states, specie, taxes, equivalent bank notes par, the old paper gold silver. its current value the time payment. this serve increase the circulation credit the bank notes; person be obliged receive private dealings. their credit depend opinion; this opinion be injured legislative interposition. art. xvi. the bank remark 16. this permission dissolve itself whenever dissolve sell pleasure, thinks proper, making effectual encourage men adventure; and, provision the payment once engaged, the profits make its debts; proprietor willing continue. bank stock have the privilege selling out whenever he pleases. art. xvii. the bank remark 17. this chiefly be established thirty years prevent some speculative men way experiment. alarmed, who, upon the whole, think paper credit detrimental dangerous, though be willing, necessity, encourage limited time. experience, too, show the defects this plan, give rise alterations the better. art. xviii. other remark 18. other banks bank, public private, be excite competition prejudicial the permitted during period. interests this, multiply diversify paper credit too much. art. xix. three banks remark 19. banks be erected massachusetts, be the interior the country, pennsylvania, virginia, remote danger, every precaution facilitate the circulation their security every way. their payment the bank notes. distance the capital trading points, be advantage, make applications the payment bank notes less convenient. art. xx. the affairs remark 20. necessary, the bank be managed reciprocal security the public, the twelve general directors, men proprietors, the people, the reputation fortune; affairs the bank be conducted eight be chosen under joint direction. the private proprietors, four congress. the minister finance have the privilege inspecting all their proceedings. these, already observed, only intended outlines; the form administration the bank, all other matters, be easily determined, the leading principles once approved. shall find good models the different european banks, which accommodate our circumstances. great care, particular, be employed guard against counterfeits; think methods be devised be effectual. see nothing prevent the practicability plan this kind, distrust the final success the war, which make men afraid risk any considerable part their fortunes the public funds; but, without enthusiast, venture assert, that, such resource here proposed, the loss our independence impossible. all have fear is, the want money disband the army, perplex enfeeble our operations, create the people general disgust alarm, which make clamor peace any terms. judicious administration our finances, assisted bank, takes place, the ancient security property restored, convulsion be apprehended. our opposition soon assume aspect system vigor, relieve encourage the people, put end the hopes the enemy. ’tis evident have not their power subdue force arms. all states have not more than fifteen thousand effective troops, nor possible much augment this number. the east west indies demand reinforcements. all the islands, have not, this time, above five thousand men; force not more than equal the proper garrisoning jamaica alone; which, the moment lose maritime superiority those seas, leave much cause fear their possessions. probably send out fifteen hundred two thousand men, recruit their regiments already here; this the utmost do. our allies have five thousand men rhode island, which, the worst event happen, be recruited eight, co-operate defensive plan. our army amount more than fifteen thousand men, the combined forces, though not equal the expulsion the enemy, be equal the purpose compelling renounce their offensive, content themselves maintaining one two capital points. this the supposition the public have the means putting their troops activity. stopping the progress their conquests, reducing unmeaning disgraceful defensive, destroy the national expectation success, which the ministry draw their resources. not vague conjecture, fact founded the best information, that, not been the capture charleston, the victory camden, the ministry have been the utmost embarrassment the supplies this year. the credit those events, procured loan five twenty millions. situation want splendid successes ruin. have carried taxation nearly its extreme boundary; have mortgaged all their funds; have large unfunded debt, besides the enormous mass which funded. this necessarily create apprehensions their most sanguine partisans: not counteracted flattering events, time time, cannot much longer continue the delusion. indeed, this case, suppose themselves despair. the game play sure game, play skill. have calculated, the preceding observations, the most disadvantageous side. many events turn up, the course the summer, make even the present campaign decisive. compare the real ability france, revenue, great britain; the economy sagacity the conduct the finances the former; the extravagance dissipation which overwhelming those the latter; there be found every reason believe, the resources france outlast those her adversary. her fleet not much inferior, independent spain holland. combined spain, greatly superior. the dutch enter into the war earnest, add their fleet, the superiority be irresistible. notwithstanding the injury sustain the first instance, the dutch be still formidable: rich credit, have extensive means maritime power. except the emperor, who hostile, the dane, who neutral, all the rest europe either friends france our independence. never nation unite more circumstances its favor than do: have nothing against our own misconduct. there two classes men among us, equally mistaken: one who, spite daily experience, accumulated distress, persist narrow line policy, and, amidst the most threatening dangers, fancy every thing perfect security. another, who, judging too much the outside, alarmed partial misfortunes, the disordered state our finances, without estimating the real faculties the parties, give themselves up ignorant ill-founded despondency. want learn appreciate our true situation the enemy. this preserve stupid insensibility danger the one hand, inspire reasonable enlightened confidence the other. let suppose the worst, shall, after all, fail our independence; our return great britain, whenever happen, be compact. the war terminate mediation. cannot be supposed the mediator be devoted great britain, have little consideration france, oblige revert our former subjection unconditional surrender. while confirm his dominion over us, endeavor save appearances the honor france, stipulate terms favorable be compatible state dependence. general amnesty, the security private property (of course the payment public debts), be among the most simple most indispensable. this comprehend the concerns the bank; if, unfortunately our virtue, such circumstance could operate inducement, be added, our enemies be glad find, encourage such institution among their own benefit. question arise concerning the abilities states pay their debts after the establishment their independence; though any doubt this head originate gross ignorance, be necessary oppose more than general argument, been done heretofore. very summary obvious calculation show there nothing be dreaded this head. the funds nine hundred seventy-nine thousand, three hundred thirty-three, one-third, dollars, proposed be established paying off the loan the first year, redeeming the present paper, will, thirty years, wipe off all the debts the states, except those contracted foreigners, which, imagine, do not amount four millions dollars. suppose be obliged, two years besides the present, borrow equal sum each year the bank; the fund requisite discharge loans, the same terms the first, amount seven hundred thirty-six thousand dollars, be deducted the five million, twenty thousand, six hundred sixty-six, two-thirds, dollars, remaining the annual revenue; which reduce four millions, two hundred eighty-four thousand, six hundred sixty-six, two-thirds, dollars: then the debt unfunded be, foreigners already contracted supposition, $4,000,000 deficiency revenue the expense be obtained credit, the first year, besides the loan the bank, 1,479,333⅓ deficiency revenue the second year deducting the fund discharging the loan this year, 1,847,333⅓ deficiency revenue the third year, making the same deduction, 2,215,333⅓ ---------- $9,542,000 should, then, the war last three years longer, which probably be the utmost term its duration, shall find ourselves unfunded debt nine million, five hundred forty-two thousand dollars, unappropriated revenue four million, two hundred eighty-four thousand, six hundred sixty-six, two-thirds, dollars. the surplus four millions, which two hundred eighty-four thousand, six hundred sixty-six, two-thirds, dollars, the funds appropriated the payment the other debts which revert the public the end thirty years, be sufficient fund the redemption this debt about thirty-five years: that, according plan, the end thirty-five years states have paid off the whole debt contracted account the war; and, the mean time, have clear revenue four millions dollars, defraying the expenses their civil military establishments. this calculation supposes the ability states revenue continue the same now are, which supposition both false unfavorable. speaking within moderate bounds, our population be doubled thirty years; there be confluence emigrants all parts the world; our commerce have proportionable progress; course our wealth capacity revenue. be matter choice not out debt twenty years, without all encumbering the people. national debt, not excessive, be national blessing. be powerful cement our union. also create necessity keeping up taxation degree which, without oppressive, be spur industry, remote europe, shall be danger. otherwise be feared our popular maxims incline too great parsimony indulgence. labor less now than any civilized nation europe; habit labor the people, essential the health vigor their minds bodies, conducive the welfare the state. not suffer our self-love deceive comparison upon points. have spun out this letter much greater length than intended. develope the whole connection ideas the subject, place plan the clearest light, have indulged myself many observations which have been omitted. shall not longer intrude upon patience than assure the sincere sentiments esteem which have the honor be, sir, most obedient humble servant, a. hamilton. [12] be feared, too, this sum rated too high. hitherto have not four hundred men state, nor very promising accounts those which be expected. [13] the proportion the european armies, general, the national population, calculated one hundred. this rule, supposing our population be two a half millions, our armies consist twenty-five thousand men; the proportion naturally be less this country. our population more diffused; there a greater facility procuring subsistence, fewer poor (and consequently fewer class men whose habits, tempers, circumstances lead embrace the military life) than any other country the world. hence is, say, twenty thousand men many shall be able raise. experience justifies this opinion. the first paroxysms enthusiasm our armies larger. believe, particular periods, have more than thirty thousand men the field: our force every year diminished, been two years past below the standard have assigned. immense efforts have been made procure men, have not been able produce more. this shows our military system still susceptible great reforms favor economy; dare not make them, because cannot pay the army. also said, twenty thousand men be many stand need of. the enemy have now less than this number within the states; cannot, the future progress the war, have more. equal force, the occasional aid the militia, confine within one two capital points; this be their defeat. have a further resource the troops our allies. not dream decisive enterprises, unless our allies assist twelve fifteen thousand land troops, undisputed maritime superiority. then, the aid the militia, drawn out a few months, undertake succeed. our true policy, the meantime, is, endeavor form a solid compact force, proportioned our necessities. [14] the possibility making up large a proportion specie depend foreign assistance. could hardly be hoped effect within ourselves, if, suppose, there not more than six millions dollars states. true, plate admitted; uncertain far this prove a resource. be wished the proportion specie be large possible: but, perhaps, fear a failure, be advisable alter the above proportions, have, upon the whole, about one-third specie, two thirds european funds landed security. [15] may, perhaps, not be impossible make some profitable speculations the bullion which the spaniards afraid transport south america europe. [16] impossible too soon make some arrangement enable congress put a stop the further emission. [17] there another immense consideration. the proprietors the bank be the holders a great part this paper. have their power double the value this plan: which is, other words, gain a hundred per cent. hamilton washington. de peyster’s point, 2, 1781. sir: am extremely sorry have embarrassed late application, think there insuperable obstacles a compliance it. renounced expectations, have other inducement troubling excellency a second letter, than obviate the appearance desired a thing inconsistent the good the service, while acquainted the circumstances made so. too interested a spectator happened the case major m’pherson, not have remarked, not recollect all the circumstances. the opposition turned ostensibly his a brevet officer, yet a command a corps formed entirely one line: the propriety his employed a detachment the army large, far remember, not disputed. delicacy major m’pherson, personal objections formally made: reality existed, contributed the discontent. thought a peculiar hardship, a gentleman who had, a long time, fought against us, not taken part till a late period, our affairs assumed a more prosperous aspect, be preferred one the most honorary commands the service. excellency be convinced, mention this other view than show the sentiments the officers the time, the whole grounds the opposition. esteem major m’pherson, other reasons, make impossible have a different intention. know less the motives dissatisfaction the case colonel gimat major galvan; have understood founded their appointed the light corps two successive campaigns. be uncandid me, not acknowledge believe a disposition exclude brevet officers general command, a great share the opposition every instance; far affects case. but, the same time, appears me, this principle alone never be productive more than momentary murmurs, not seconded some plausible pretext. also am convinced the pennsylvania officers, their own sakes, repented the rash steps taken; and, cool reflection, happy opportunity relinquish their menaces quitting a service which attached habit, inclination, interest, well patriotism. believe, too, shall never have a similar instance the army, unless the practice be carried excess. major galvan, am told, probably be relieved. colonel gimat be then the only brevet officer remaining command. excellency the best judge the proper limits; there be doubt, the rights particular officers give place the general good tranquillity the service. cannot forbear repeating, case peculiar, dissimilar all the former. distinguished the circumstances have before intimated;

nor esteem confidence which make now sensibly feel the obliging expressions letter, fail have a great share influencing future exertions. have the honor be, perfect esteem respect, obedient servant, a. hamilton. robert morris, esq. hamilton gov. clinton. poughkeepsie, july 16, 1782. sir: have the honor inclose excellency the copy a warrant the honorable robert morris, esq., superintendent the finances the united states; which perceive that, agreeably the resolution congress the second november last, he appointed receiver the continental taxes this state. am therefore request the legislature be pleased vest the authority required resolution. a part duty explain the legislature, time time, the views the superintendent finance, pursuance the orders congress, be the better enabled judge the measures most proper be adopted effectual co-operation. this purpose, pray excellency impart request, have the honor a conference a committee the two houses, such time place find convenient. have the honor be, perfect respect esteem, excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency governor clinton. hamilton morris. poughkeepsie, may 22, 1782. sir: agreeably letter albany, came this place, interview a committee the legislature, which urged the several matters contained instructions. strongly represented the necessity solid arrangements finance; and, way argument, pointed out all the defects the present system. found every man convinced something wrong, few willing recognize the mischief defined, consent the proper remedy. the quantum taxes already imposed great make useless impose any others a considerable amount. a bill has, however, passed both houses, payable specie, bank notes, notes, eighteen thousand pounds. present appropriated order; doubt whether some subsequent arrangement not take place a different appropriation. the commander-in-chief applied a quantity forage, which the legislature devising the means furnishing; fear finish diverting the eighteen thousand pounds purpose. have hitherto been able prevent this; indispensable importance leave this place immediately, prepare examination, which have pledged myself the ensuing term, which hand, possible, after have left it, contrary ideas prevail. efforts have been made introduce a species negotiable certificates, which have strenuously opposed. not yet taken place; am not clear the matter terminate. the bill the eighteen thousand pounds go out its present form, cannot hope produce the treasury above half the sum; such the vices our present mode collection. a bill also passed the assembly collecting arrearages taxes, payable specie, bank notes, notes; old continental emissions one hundred twenty-eight one, a species certificates issued the state the purchase horses. this now before the senate. the arrearages very large. both houses have unanimously passed a set resolutions, be transmitted congress the several states, proposing a convention the states, enlarge the powers congress vest funds. think this a very eligible step, though doubt the concurrence the other states; am certain, without it, never be brought co-operate any reasonable effectual plan. urge reforms, exertions, the answer constantly is, avails one state make without the concert the others? vain expose the futility this reasoning: founded all those passions which have the strongest influence the human mind. the legislature have also appointed, instance, a committee devise, its recess, a more effectual system taxation, communicate this subject. a good deal depend the success this attempt. convinced the absurdity multiplying taxes the present mode, where, effect, the payment voluntary, the money received exhausted the collection, have labored chiefly instil the necessity a change the plan; and, though not rapidly the exigency public affairs requires, truth seems be making some progress. there other appropriation the use congress than the eighteen thousand pounds. shall, soon possible, give a full just view the situation temper this state. this cannot be till after intended examination: over, shall lay myself out every way can promote views the public good. am informed have an appointment make a commissioner accounts this state. permit suggest the expediency choosing a citizen the state; a man who, the qualifications requisite the execution the office, adds an influence its affairs. need not particularize the reasons this suggestion. next also take the liberty mention some characters. omitted mentioning the two houses have also passed a bill, authorizing congress adjust the quotas the states equitable principles, agreeably recommendation. have the honor be, sincere attachment respect, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. the hon. robert morris, esq. hamilton colonel hay. albany, august 3, 1782. dear sir: mr. morris, some time since, a circular letter the states, among other things, requested have an account all the money, provisions, transportations, etc., furnished this state the united states, since the eighteenth march, seventeen hundred eighty. have been very happy hear, this business been intrusted hands: am sure, feeling its importance, give all the dispatch power. have written the governor the subject; but, lest other occupations delay his attention it, must request inform me, precisely, part the matter been intrusted management, what progress have been able make. shall also thank send the amount any certificates, paper money any shape, which, through office, have passed into circulation, distinguishing the different species. do a favor letting hear soon possible. am, sincere esteem, obedient servant, a. hamilton. p. s. must still trouble an additional request, which is, let know, exactly possible, the gross product each supply-bill department specie value, the amount all expenses each. this want, a view the subjects have been speaking of. a. h. hamilton governor clinton. albany, august 8, 1782. sir: have lately received a letter the superintendent finance, inclosing a copy a circular letter him the several states, dated twenty-fifth july, ’81, which he requests information the following important points. “what supplies, every kind, money, provisions, forage, transportation, etc., have been furnished this state the united states, since the eighteenth march, 1780.” “the amount the money the treasury: the sums expected be there; the times probably be brought in; the appropriations.” “the amount the different paper currencies the state; the probable increase, decrease, each; the respective rates depreciation.” “the acts passed since the eighteenth march, 1780, raising taxes, furnishing supplies, etc.; the manner have been executed; the time necessary operate; the consequences their operation; the policy the state relative laying, assessing, levying, collecting taxes.” his letter, which _circular_, the receivers, he says the answers he received these inquiries few short the object; he therefore urges take the most speedy effectual means, power, enable him form a proper judgment such the subjects referred to, the actual state things renders important know. compliance this, request the favor excellency inform me, what steps have been taken the several heads which the above an abstract: what progress been made the business; particularly respect the first article. shall also be much obliged direct mr. holt furnish me, without delay, the acts mentioned the inclosed list. excellency must have been too sensible the necessity enabling the director the finances the united states form a just judgment the true state our affairs, have omitted any measure power procure the fullest information the several matters submitted you: am persuaded the business such a train little be left do. entreat do the honor let hear soon possible the subject. promote the public business, be good direct mr. banker supply such information call upon him for. he very obliging, without some authority the purpose, there a delicacy calling upon him. wrote the same time mr. holt, printer the state, desiring him forward the copies the acts above mentioned; telling him, the governor did not make satisfaction, do it. these acts all those relative finance supply, march eighteenth, 1780, this time. perfect respect, am excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency governor clinton. hamilton the county treasurers. albany, august 5th, 1782. sir: be great utility the state, essential the execution instructions the superintendent finance, be able ascertain, speedily possible, the expense attending the collection taxes within this state. order this, shall be much obliged send without delay an account what have received county, since the beginning the year ’80 this time, well the taxes laid county purposes, those imposed the legislature;

doing which, serve the public oblige, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton, receiver c. s. the state n. y. hamilton morris. august 13, 1782. dear sir: the speculation evils, the claims great britain, gives way the pressure inconveniences actually suffered; required the event which lately happened, the recognition our independence the dutch, give a new spring the public hopes the public passions. this a good effect. the legislature can be brought adopt a wise plan its finances, may put the people better humor, give a more regular durable movement the machine. the people this state, far observation goes, have much firmness their make, much submissiveness government, those any part the union. remains give an explicit opinion what practicable this state do. even a judicious plan taxation, do not think the state can afford, the people bear pay, more than seventy eighty thousand pounds a year. its entire flourishing state, according mode calculating, could not have exceeded two hundred thirty forty thousand pounds; and, reduced is, the wheels circulation exceedingly clogged want commerce a sufficient medium, more than have said cannot be expected. passed experience not authorize a more flattering conclusion. out this be deducted the expense the interior administration government, the money necessary the levies men. the first amounts about twelve thousand pounds, perceive the inclosed statement; suppose the legislature choose retain fifteen thousand pounds. the money hitherto yearly expended recruits, amounted between twenty thirty thousand pounds; but, a proper plan, ten thousand pounds suffice. there then remain forty thousand pounds department. this the supposition a change system; for, the present, doubt there paid into the continental treasury one-third the sum. am endeavoring collect materials greater certainty upon this subject; the business supplies been diversified, lodged such a variety independent hands, carelessly transacted, hardly possible get any tolerable idea the gross net product. the help these materials shall strive convince the committee, meet, a change measures essential. enter cordially into right views, may succeed: confess fear more than hope. have taken every step power procure the information have desired letter july ’81; the most material part it, an account the supplies furnished since march seventeen hundred eighty, been committed colonel hay. have written him, pressing terms, accelerate the preparation. perceive, sir, have neither flattered the state, nor encouraged high expectations. thought duty exhibit things are, not ought be. shall be sorry give an ill opinion the state, want equal candor the representation others; for, however disagreeable the reflection, have too much reason believe, the true picture other states be, proportion their circumstances, equally unpromising. all inquiries, all appears, induces this opinion. intend this letter _in confidence_ yourself, therefore endorse private. before conclude, say a word a point possibly wish be informed about. the contract up this way executed generously the satisfaction officers soldiers; which the more meritorious the contractor, as, all probability, be him a losing undertaking. have the honor be, sentiments unfeigned respect, sir, most ob’t humble serv’t, a. hamilton. the hon. robert morris, esq. governor clinton hamilton. poughkeepsie, august 18, 1782. sir: have received letter the third instant. am not authorized direct the printer deliver any the laws, except a certain number sets which law directed particular purposes. have, however, mentioned desire the gentlemen the committee appointed superintend the printing distribution them, requested furnish a set, which doubt not be complied with. some short time before the appointment a superintendent finance, transmitted congress the most perfect information able collect, many the matters mentioned letter; intention, time time, have continued these communications mr. morris; our laws remaining long unprinted, the dispersed situation the different public officers, the difficulty, this circumstance, well the want authority, some instances, command the necessary returns, rendered a business, not impracticable, requiring more time attention than the indispensable duties office afforded leisure bestow. shall, however, be happy give every aid power facilitate it. the laws, the returns which have lately been made the different public officers, may be found the files the legislature, the treasurer’s office, answer most the questions stated. the answers the others, appear depend, some measure, matter opinion; and, the operation our laws often obstructed, the intended consequences defeated, unforeseen events arising our embarrassed situation, cannot be given any great degree precision. readily perceive, sir, the treasurer, the nature his office, not, except cases provided law, subject control. am persuaded, however, he, well the clerks the legislature, readily give every information assistance consistent the duties their respective offices. am, great respect esteem, sir, most obedient servant, geo. clinton. col. alexander hamilton. pickering hamilton. new-windsor, august 20, 1782. dear sir: have some bills exchange, drawn mr. morris john swanwick, which am authorized exchange the receivers the continental taxes any the states eastward pennsylvania. mr. morris informed me, he advised the receivers this measure, directed their taking up the bills whenever cash. taxes loan, expect this state shortly furnish money. am indebted the subjects many special engagements, which am anxious fulfil. therefore greatly oblige me, giving me, time time, information the money shall receive; order secure the earliest supply, lodge, please, some the bills hands. bank notes mr. morris’s notes be useful me, though not beneficial cash. am, dear sir, respect esteem, most obedient servant, tim. pickering, _q. m. g._ col. alex. hamilton. hamilton morris. albany, august 25, 1782. sir: this letter serves only transmit the two last papers. wish the measures have taken satisfy the points desire be informed of, been attended much success enable now transmit the result. find a singular confusion the accounts kept the public officers whom must necessarily derive information, a singular dilatoriness complying application, partly indolence, partly jealousy the office. hope, the next post, transmit information some particulars. have the honor be, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. robert morris, esq. hamilton meade. albany, august 27, 1782. thank you, dear meade, letter the first this month, which perceive travelled much faster than been usual our letters. our correspondence, hitherto, been unfortunate;

although cannot name the citizen any state settle the accounts particular state, consistently the general line conduct have laid down myself; yet shall do, other respects, what my power. have not hitherto been able fix a proper commissioner the state new-york. the office vacant new hampshire rhode island. inclose a copy the ordinance the subject, may know the powers, duties, emoluments; have request offer these places colonel malcolm mr. lawrence. make the first offer, including the choice, own judgment may direct. the gentlemen, either them, accept, be kind give early notice. then immediately recommend the states respectively; receiving their approbation, the proper instructions, etc., can be expedited. am sorry learn any letter have given offence; conclude this effect must follow many parts my writings conduct; because the steady pursuit what appears be the true line duty, necessarily cross the various oblique views interest opinion. offend sometimes a fault, always a misfortune. the letter question is, suppose, under the date the eleventh december, which inclose a copy. let me, the same time, assure you, all excellent letter the thirteenth instant, most esteem the clause now question; because contains useful information which least common. make apologies the letter any one, because apologies rarely useful; the intention been good, are, candid minds, unnecessary. possessed the facts, can guard against misrepresentation; have ever found be the most hostile weapon which either my personal political enemies have been able wield against me. have not, _even yet_, seen the resolutions legislature relative an extension the powers congress. supposed the same reason which have expressed. indeed, power generally such a darling object weak minds, must feel extreme reluctance bid farewell; neither do believe any thing induce a general consent part it, a perfect sense absolute necessity. this may arise two sources; the one reason, the other feeling: the former more safe more uncertain; the latter always severe often dangerous. is, my dear sir, circumstances like this, a patriot mind, seeking the great good the whole, enlightened principles, can best be distinguished those vulgar souls whose narrow optics can see the little circle selfish concerns. unhappily, such souls too common, too often fill the seats dignity authority. a firm, wise, manly system federal government what once wished, what now hope, what dare not expect, what not despair of. description the mode collecting taxes, contains an epitome the follies which prevail one end the continent the other. there end the absurdity human nature. mankind seem delight contrast paradox; surely nothing else could sanctify (during a contest the precise point taxed our own consent) the arbitrary policy which, this subject, almost universally prevails. god grant success views amend it. ideas the subject perfectly correspondent my own. doubt the mode collecting it, wish obviate the observation, the farther off can remove the appointment collectors popular influence, the more effectual be their operations; the more conform the views congress, the more effectually enable body provide general defence. political life, the creature generally pay some deference both. the a double set officers indeed an evil; a good thing not always be rejected because necessary portion evil which, the course things, must be attached it. neither this a necessary evil; for, a proper federal government, army, navy, revenue, the civil administration well be provided a stamp act, roads turnpikes, navigations tolls. the account give the state means flattering: the more true appears, the more concern gives me. the loan, hope, be completed; wish the _whole_ amount the tax may be collected. the forage plan have disagreed to; inclose, information, the copy my letter, subject, the quartermaster general. believe state exhausted: perhaps even consider more than is. the certificates, which now form a useless load, (if the united states adopt, the several states agree to, a plan now before congress) become valuable property. this afford great relief. the scarcity money, also, may be immediately relieved, the love popular favor far give way the love public good, enforce plentiful taxation. the necessity money always produce money. the desire it, produces, see, much necessary gratify the desire enjoying foreign luxuries. turn the stream, which now flows the channels commerce, those revenue, the business completed. unfortunately us, this an operation which requires fortitude, perseverance, virtue; which cannot be effected the weak wicked minds who have only partial, private, interested views. consider the exertions which the country possess already made, under striking disadvantages, astonishing prodigality national wealth, pernicious modes applying it; persuade myself, regular, consistent efforts, produce much more than suppose. * * * * * am, perfect respect, most obedient humble servant, robert morris. alexander hamilton, esq. hamilton robert morris. albany, august 31, 1782. sir: send herewith all the acts the legislature this state since the government been organized; the margin which have numbered all the acts relative the matters mention letter july, ’81, the states agreeable the within list. inclose the papers the last week. the indolence some, the repugnancy others, make every trifle lag much the execution, am not able this time give any further information. wish hear the subject my former letters previous the meeting the committee--the 15th the ensuing month. have the honor be very truly, sir, most obedient servant, a. h. the honorable superintendent finance. governor clinton hamilton. poughkeepsie, september 2, 1782. sir: am favored letter the 25th instant, previous which, a view accelerating the collection the last tax, prepared, have since dispatched a circular letter the several county treasurers, urging the other officers concerned, a prompt execution their duty, case neglect the penalty the law without favor be put into execution. have not received information all the counties, this some others, know the business good train, am led hope the taxes be speedily collected paid in. my agents employed procure moneys loan some time since transmitted a small sum, not sufficient answer the orders the legislature favor the delegates some other public matters. the channel through which this money procured subject interruption disappointment, cannot present inform any sum be depended on, expect soon see hear the gentlemen, may rest assured informed the result without delay. am, great respect esteem, sir, most obedient servant, geo. clinton. col. hamilton. hamilton the county treasurers. albany, september 7, 1782. sir: the fifteenth this month the period fixed the payment the tax imposed the last meeting the legislature the use the united states. the public exigencies, the reputation the state, require every exertion should be made collect this tax punctuality dispatch; is, therefore, my duty urge you, employ the powers vested you, all personal influence, induce the collectors expedite the collection all the zeal vigor their power. while the other states all doing something, a citizen this, shall feel a sensible mortification obliged continue publishing the others, this state pays nothing support the war, have been under the necessity doing the last two months. besides this, other still more weighty considerations, a regard the subjects the state itself demands every exertion our power. have parted their property the public faith, impossible the public fulfil its engagements individuals, unless enabled do the equal just contributions the community large. am, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. hamilton morris. albany, september 7, 1782. sir: have the inclosed ready some time; hopes receiving the returns the certificates mentioned memorandum b, delayed sending the present sketch. even received answers some the parties, who live a distance me, suspect have done their business disorderly a manner (to say nothing worse it) a loss render the accounts; have, therefore, concluded not detain any longer what have procured. do not take the step mentioned memorandum a, because doubted its propriety. raise expectations about the old money, which, possibly, may not enter into plans raise: and, besides this, knowing what been called in, each state (which the sketch send you, appear this), can determine the balance emissions remaining out, except what may have worn out been accidentally destroyed. desire this step be taken, obey commands. have said nothing the rates depreciation, because imagine letter, written july, ’80, reference the rates which the money then actually circulating, the circulation now totally ceased. the laws sent the last post, inform the rates fixed different periods the legislature: forty, seventy-five, lastly, one hundred twenty-eight. am obliged infer there a studied backwardness the officers the state, who ought give the information require respecting the supplies different kinds which have been furnished the use the united states. indeed, find, inquiry, their joint information not be full satisfy intentions; this cannot be done till have appointed a commissioner accounts, authorized enter into all the details, aided some legislative arrangement which may be obtained the next session. have the honor be, great respect esteem, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. robert morris, esq. hamilton timothy pickering. albany, september 7, 1782. dear sir: this day received letter the 20th august. mr. morris advised the bills describe, directed my purchasing them, together his notes, the bank notes; what money shall come into my hands public account. now beginning collect the tax imposed the use the united states, though can yet form judgment what success expedition. shall pleasure give the information ask, rather wish be excused anticipation previous deposits my hands, some measure pledge give a preference the bills deposited, may hereafter expose a charge partiality. there have been several applications a similar anticipation which have avoided; reserving myself the power paying the bills shall be presented, proportion the nearness remoteness the periods payments. may, however, depend shall be happy assist department, keep view present request. hope, towards the latter end the month, shall receive something considerable the late tax. am, dear sir, very truly, obedient servant, a. hamilton. timothy pickering, d. q. gen. hamilton robert morris. albany, sept. 14, 1782. sir: have the honor acknowledge the receipt letter the 29th august, the contents which shall be executed. have just received the post accounts the specific supplies furnished the state; copies which shall prepare be transmitted the next post, am return the originals, which the inspection the legislature. hope add these accounts the moneys supplied. have written a number letters since my journey poughkeepsie, which, contain some things a confidential nature, am not without anxiety learn the safe arrival. should also have been happy have received instructions against the meeting the committee, which take place to-morrow. have other business, hear the next post, shall not be too late. am a loss know whether ought press the establishment permanent _funds_ not; though unless receive instructions, following my own apprehensions what probably views, shall dwell this article. have the honor be, perfect respect, sir, most ob’t serv’t, a. hamilton. inclose a copy a letter the governor, the 2d inst., which see his hopes. mine not good. this vicinity, always delinquent, little doing. hamilton robert morris. albany, sept. 21, 1782. sir: the hurry which wrote the last post, prevented my examining particularly the papers which informed received. a more careful inspection them, found not so complete hoped. there a general state specific supplies; the returns referred the particulars, some mistake omitted. have written them, have not yet arrived; do, shall lose time forwarding them. observe there nothing respecting transportation; there a part the supplies the period before col. hay came into office, which estimated a scale proportion--too vague a method be satisfactory. have urged him send an account the transportation, collect, speedily possible, official returns the supplies above mentioned. there a practice obtaining which appears contravene views. the contractors, am informed, have gotten into a method carrying bills immediately the collectors drawing the specie out their hands, which means the paper never goes into circulation all; passes, so speak, immediately out one hand the public into the other. the people, therefore, can never be familiarized the paper, nor can ever obtain a general currency. the specie come into the receivers’ hands, the contractors left under a necessity exerting their influence induce the inhabitants take notes, be afterwards redeemed the receivers agreeably plan, this gradually accustom the people place confidence the notes; though the circulation first should be momentary, come be more permanent. am doubt, whether the mere speculation an evil, without instructions, ought take any step prevent this practice. for, should forbid the exchange, possibly cause a suspicion there a preference the paper the specie, which injure its credit. have thought a method prevent, without forbidding direct terms. this require each collector return the names the persons whom he received taxes, different columns, specify the kind money, whether specie, notes, bank notes, which the tax paid; giving the inhabitants receipts accordingly; paying money the same species which received. this cover the object. have tried prevail upon the county treasurer this place, instruct the collectors accordingly; the great aim all these people avoid trouble; he affected consider the matter a herculean labor. nor be done without a legislative injunction. a method this kind tend much check fraud the collectors; have many good consequences. thought my duty, any rate, apprise the practice, that, my apprehensions right, may not be continued without control. have reason believe very extensive--by means confined this state. permit make one more observation. notes, though credit the merchants way remittance, do not enter far into ordinary circulation, this principally account their size; which even makes inconvenient paying taxes. the taxes very few amount twenty dollars a single tax; though the farmers combine sell their produce the notes, pay the taxes jointly; yet this not always convenient, seldom be practised. the notes were, considerable part, five, eight, ten dollars, their circulation be far more general; the merchants would, even their retail operations, give specie exchange balances; which few care do, can do, the larger notes; though willing take their goods. a. hamilton. hamilton morris. september 28, 1782. sir: have been honored this week letters the twenty-eighth august, the sixth, twelfth, seventeenth instant, their inclosures. gives the most real pleasure find my past communications have met approbation; feel a particular satisfaction the friendly confidence which letters manifest. am persuaded substantial reasons have determined choice a particular instance doctor tillotson; am flattered the attention have obligingly paid my recommendations colonel malcolm mr. lawrence. those gentlemen now here. make the warmest acknowledgments offer, decline leaving the state; which, indeed, not compatible the present prospects either them. am glad have an opportunity perusing letter this state, which so much exception been taken; because confirmed what presumed, there been much unjustifiable ill-humor upon the occasion. make use the knowledge have combat misrepresentation. the twenty-ninth july congress, full principles arguments luminous conclusive. be lamented have not more weight than infer the momentary expedient adopted the resolutions the fourth tenth; which will, alone, not be satisfactory the public creditors; fear only tend embarrass present operations, without answering the end view. the more see, the more find reason those who love this country weep over its blindness. the committee the subject taxation met. some have their plans; must protect their own children, however misshapen: others have none; determined find fault all. expect little, shall promote any thing, though imperfect, mend our situation. sentiments the greatest respect esteem, have the honor be, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. p.s. the public creditors this quarter, have a meeting, appointed a committee devise measures. the committee report petitions congress the legislature; an address the public creditors other parts the state, appoint persons meet convention, unite some common measure. believe also propose a general convention all the creditors the different states. a. h. the hon. robert morris, esq. hamilton morris. albany, oct. 5, 1782. sir: my last informed you, the committee, appointed the legislature the subject taxation, together. spite my efforts, have parted without doing any thing decisive. have, indeed, agreed upon several matters, those importance; have not reduced the form a report; which, fact, leaves every thing afloat, be governed the impressions the moment, the legislature meets. the points agreed upon, these: there shall be an actual valuation land, a tax so much the pound. the great diversity the qualities land not suffer listen an estimated valuation, a tax the quantity, agreeably the idea late report congress. there shall be also a tariff all personal property, be also taxed so much the pound; there shall be a specific tax carriages, clocks, watches, other similar articles luxury; money, usury, shall be taxed a fixed rate the pound, excluding which loaned the public; houses, all towns, shall be taxed a certain proportion the annual rent; there shall be a poll tax all single men fifteen upwards; the collection the taxes should be advertised the lowest bidder, a fixed rate per cent., bearing all subordinate expenses. among other things which rejected, pressed hard an excise distilled liquors; all could be carried this article a license taverns. the committee pretty generally opinion, the system funding payment old debts, procuring further credit, wise indispensable; a majority thought be unwise one state contribute this way alone. nothing decided the quantum taxes which the state able pay: those who went furthest, did not exceed seventy thousand pounds, which fifty the use the united states. send my cash account, which what been received this county. have not heard the others. have the honor be, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. the hon. robert morris, esq. morris hamilton. office finance, october 5, 1782. sir: have now before letters the fourteenth twenty-first last month. am sorry find less sanguine pecuniary expectations than the governor appears be; have always found the worst forebodings this subject the truest. find, the bottom this letter, a list all those which have hitherto received you. think have all been already acknowledged; lest should not, will see one moment, the list, whether any have miscarried. am not surprised find the contractors apply their paper, the first instance, the receivers collectors. this expected, because much paper not fit other purposes. some it, however, which payable the bearer, calculated circulation; which observe not so general otherwise have been, reason the largeness the sums expressed the notes. mr. duer’s letters contain the same sentiment. issuing this paper, one principal view facilitate the payment taxes obviating the too general (though unjust) complaint the want a circulating medium. substituting paper specie, the first obstacle be encountered, the total diffidence which arisen the late profusion it. a considerable quantity been thrown into the hands class the people, whose ideas the subject money, more the offspring habit than reason, must have depreciated. this apprehension just, clear this fact, the paper first issued, the bank paper which came out after it, did depreciate ten fifteen per cent. the eastern states, notwithstanding all the precautions which used. not taken immediate measures create a demand the spot, stop issues quarter, its credit have been totally lost a time, not easily restored. besides that, the quantities which pouring thence have done mischief here. confidence a plant very slow growth; our political situation not too favorable it. am, therefore, very unwilling hazard the germ a credit, which will, its greater maturity, become very useful. my notes circulate only among mercantile people, do not regret it, rather wish the circulation may, the present, be confined them, the wealthier members other professions. nothing the greater convenience, which will induce people prefer any kind paper the precious metals; this convenience principally felt large sums. whenever the shopkeepers, general, discover my paper will answer a remittance the principal ports, will be readily exchanged the receivers, will readily exchange other people. the people, general, find the shopkeepers receive freely, will begin look after it, not before. must know, whatever fine plausible speeches may be made this subject, the farmers will not give full credit money, merely because will pay taxes: an object not very violently devoted to. money which goes freely the store the tavern, will be sought after greedily those things which the store the tavern contain. still, however, objection remains good; the traffickings which the greater part the community engage, do not require sums so large twenty dollars. this shall readily acknowledge: will observe there infinitely less danger large notes, which go only through the hands intelligent people, will be counterfeited than small ones, which come the possession illiterate men. public credit firmly established, the little shocks receives the counterfeiters paper money, do not lead material consequences; but, the present ticklish state things, there just ground apprehension. besides this, the value paper will depend much upon the interchanges specie: these will not take place there a circulation small paper. lastly, have observe, until more reliance can be placed the revenues required, dare not issue any very considerable amount this paper, lest should be run upon more than could answer: the circulation what dare issue, increasing the general mass, enables people (so far goes) more easily get hold other money, consequently produces, its degree, object facilitating taxation which view. am, sir, most obedient, humble servant, robert morris. alexander hamilton, esq., receiver new-york. hamilton de noailles. 1782. esteem talents acquirements a sentiment which, my earliest acquaintance you, my dear viscount, have shared common all those who have the happiness knowing you;

believe his views do not extend beyond the mere possession the country. said the assemblies the two invaded states about meeting, restore the administration government. this will be a step strengthening the hands general greene, counteracting the future intrigues the enemy. many sanguine believing all the southern posts will be evacuated, a fleet transports actually gone bring the garrisons away. my part, have doubts upon the subject. my politics are, while the present ministry can maintain their seats, procure supplies, will prosecute the war the mere chance events; while this the plan, will not evacuate posts so essential points departure; whence, any favorable turn affairs, renew their attack our most vulnerable side. nor will relinquish objects be so useful them, should the worst happen a final negotiation. clinton, said, cutting a canal across new-york island, through the low grounds, about a mile a half the city. this will be an additional obstacle;

revived, some measure, the public credit; conciliating fast the support the moneyed men. his operations have hitherto hinged chiefly the seasonable aids country; he urging the establishment permanent funds among ourselves: though, the nature temper our governments, his applications will meet a dilatory compliance, be hoped will degrees succeed. the institution a bank been very serviceable him: the commercial interest, finding great advantages it, anticipating much greater, disposed promote the plan;

will not alone be sufficient. upon the whole, however, the war continues another year, will be necessary congress should again recur the generosity france pecuniary assistance. the plans the financier cannot be so matured enable us, any possibility, dispense this; he should fail want support, must replunge into confusion distress which like have proved fatal us, out which slowly emerging. the cure, a relapse, be infinitely more difficult than ever. have given an uninteresting a faithful sketch our situation. may expect, time time, receive the progress our affairs;

one written your way boston, two france. acknowledge have written only once; the reason been, have been taught daily expect your return. this should not have done my own calculations; saw prospect an inactive campaign; much better be intriguing your hobby-horse paris, than loitering away your time here. yet seem be convinced, head quarters, certainly coming out; your letters appears have been your own expectation. imagine have relinquished this time. have been employed the last ten months rocking the cradle studying the art _fleecing_ my neighbors. am now a grave counsellor-at-law, shall soon be a grave member congress. the legislature, their last session, took into their heads name me, pretty unanimously, one their delegates. am going throw away a few months more public life, then retire a simple citizen good _paterfamilias_. set out philadelphia a few days. see the disposition am in. condemned run the race ambition all your life. am already tired the career, dare leave it. not give a pin my letter unless politics war made a part it. tell employed building _a peace_: other accounts say nearly finished. hope the work may meet interruptions. necessary america;

the war goes on, the removal the army not prove an unwise measure, renounce all future pretensions judgment. think, however, the circumstances the enemy oblige peace. have been hoping abandon their posts these states. doubt once contemplation, latter appearances rather ambiguous. begin suspect peace not made, new-york charleston, the former least, will still be held. there probability shall be one the commissioners peace. a thing do not desire myself, which imagine other people will not desire. our army now excellent order, small. the temper respecting the alliance, will see public acts. there never a time greater unanimity point. wish durst enter into a greater detail you;

this refused, anticipate calamities a most menacing nature--with this consolation, however, have faithfully discharged their trust, the mischiefs which follow cannot be attributed them. a principal object the proposed fund _procure loans abroad_. security can be held out lenders, the success these must necessarily be very limited. the last accounts the subject not flattering; intelligence shall arrive europe, the state rhode island disagreed the only fund which yet been devised, there every reason apprehend will have a fatal influence upon their future progress. deprived this resource, our affairs must all probability hasten a dangerous crisis, these states be involved greater embarrassments than have yet experienced, which may be much more difficult emerge. congress will only add a request your excellency, the legislature should not be sitting, may be called together speedily possible, enable the gentlemen whom have deputed perform the purpose their mission. governor clinton hamilton. poughkeepsie, december 29, 1782. dear sir: before honored your letter the eighteenth instant, received a line colonel floyd the same subject. my answer his forwarded the present conveyance, beg leave refer information. hope may prove satisfactory; flatter myself further disappointment can take place. should i, however, be mistaken, have only advise it, will immediately forward the cash. phelps, who delayed the road the late heavy fall snow, waited a few days since, delivered your official dispatches the ninth instant. considering the disposition heretofore discovered congress, the subject our controversy the grants, their resolutions which inclosed me, though short what justly entitled to, exceed my expectations; am not without hope, properly improved, may be the mean leading a just favorable issue. the idea many the military being interested the independency vermont, consequence their taken grants lands under them, believe without foundation. there a period the disposition congress, founded political expedience, appeared so favorable the independence district, have induced some gentlemen the army apply the usurped government grants. discovered intriguing the common enemy, the more respectable characters withdrew their applications, relinquished all kind connection them; even those who did not go so far, imagine conceive themselves perfectly secure under our late acts. if, however, this should not be the case, any difficulty which may be apprehended may be easily obviated; am persuaded the legislature disposed every liberal act may consist the honor the state, tend facilitate a settlement the dispute. there a time, not long since, congress only have spoken decisively the subject, would have been obeyed: nor do believe the time yet past, could be convinced congress earnest. force necessary carry their decision into execution, the longer delayed the more force will require. the misfortune is, though believe there few states favor their independence, some members those who do, take great pains encourage the revolters their opposition, secret assurances congress will not direct any coercive measures against them: am not without my fears this conduct will, some measure, defeat the present resolutions. am, great respect esteem, dear sir, your most obedient servant, george clinton. the hon. alexander hamilton, esq. la fayette hamilton. (most private.) cadix, feb. 5, 1783. your friendship me, my dear sir, the affection have you, command my most _confidential_ communications. public affairs have the first place me, let tell our articles confederation ought be revised, measures immediately taken invigorate the continental union; depend upon it, there lies the danger america; this last stroke wanting, unless the states be strongly bound each other, have much fear british, and, indeed, european politics. there ought be delegates each state, perhaps some officers among them, one whom would be happy be, who, toward next fall, would meet together, under the presidence general washington, may devise upon amendments be proposed the articles confederation--limits states, &c., &c., &c. the army, hope their country will be grateful, hope the half pay affair may be terminated their satisfaction. now, my dear sir, am going torment my private concerns. first all, wish the people america know that, have lengthened my furlough, their service, the request their commissioners; upon my embarking a fresh expedition, a view join the summer, forces adequate every plan general washington had directed promote; that, moreover, a canadian expedition take place; then, instead sending a vessel, going myself america. entreaties your residence madrid have forced go there, probably there paris; the month june, am embark america. confess, my dear sir, have a great value my american popularity, want the people large know my affection my zeal their service. the best way manage have a resolve congress published, way answer my letters, wherein their approbation my conduct will comprehend the above mentioned matters. there another thing which would highly flatter me, lies within your department; a ratification the treaty will be sent congress the court england; an honorary commission, requires only a few weeks, even a few days’ attendance. the sedentary minister may send, me, after me, or, what would like better, the time great britain sent you. so many greater proofs confidence have been bestowed upon congress, may truly tell my wishes upon this very pleasing mark their esteem. upon my leaving england, have been considered there an enthusiastic rebel, and, indeed, a young madman. would well enough like present myself there the capacity an extraordinary envoy the united states; though upon my committing so far the french ambassador, have been him pretty bad terms; now our friendship revived, am a situation lead him into my measures, know his secrets without telling him mine. the choice a minister, (this commission being only a compliment,) think a very difficult task. advise take a gentleman who had connection the great men england; our friend hamilton would be a very proper choice; ought bring about. acquainted col. harrison, who the general’s family; there few men so honest sensible; hope may send hamilton, he knows better than all the british councils. case congress pleased do what have so much heart, would beg send mr. mchenry me, a member the maryland senate. this, my dear sir, entirely confidential you, _for alone_; should the general be philadelphia, may show him. adieu. my best respects wait upon your lady family. most affectionately, am yours, la fayette. should think any use have printed the last paragraph my letter congress, will be glad it, the opinion one who knows europe may have some weight the people. hamilton washington. philadelphia, february 7, 1788. sir: flattering myself your knowledge will induce receive the observations make, dictated a regard the public good, take the liberty suggest my ideas some matters delicacy importance. view the present juncture a very interesting one. need not observe far the temper situation the army make so. the state our finances perhaps never more critical. am under injunctions which will not permit disclose some facts would once demonstrate this position; think probable will be possessed through another channel. is, however, certain, there scarcely been a period the revolution which called more wisdom decision congress. unfortunately us, a body not governed reason foresight, circumstances. probable shall not take the proper measures; do not, a few months may open an embarrassing scene. this will be the case, whether have peace a continuance the war. the war continues, would seem the army must, june, subsist itself, _to defend the country_. peace should take place, _will_ subsist itself, _to procure justice itself_. appears be a prevailing opinion the army, the disposition recompense their services, will cease the necessity them; once lay down their arms, part the means obtaining justice. be lamented appearances afford too much ground their distrust. becomes a serious inquiry, what the true line policy? the claims the army, urged moderation, firmness, may operate those weak minds which influenced their apprehensions more than their judgments, so produce a concurrence the measures which the exigencies affairs demand. may add weight the applications congress the several states. so far a useful turn may be given them. the difficulty will be, keep a _complaining_ _suffering army_ within the bounds moderation. this your excellency’s influence must effect. order it, will be advisable not discountenance their endeavors procure redress, rather, the intervention confidential prudent persons, _to take the direction them_. this, however, must not appear. moment the public tranquillity, your excellency should preserve the confidence the army without losing the people. this will enable you, case extremity, guide the torrent, bring order, perhaps even good, out confusion. ’tis a part requires address; ’tis one which your own situation, well the welfare the community, points out. will not conceal your excellency a truth which necessary should know. an idea propagated the army, delicacy, carried an extreme, prevents your espousing its interests sufficient warmth. the falsehood this opinion one can be better acquainted than myself; not the less mischievous being false. its tendency impair influence which may exert advantage, should any commotions unhappily ensue, moderate the pretensions the army, make their conduct correspond their duty. the great _desideratum_ present, the establishment general funds, which alone can do justice the creditors the united states (of whom the army forms the most meritorious class), restore public credit, supply the future wants government. this the object all men sense. this, the influence the army, properly directed, may co-operate. the intimations have thrown out, will suffice give your excellency a proper conception my sentiments. will judge their reasonableness fallacy; persuade myself will do justice my motives. have the honor be, great respect, your excellency’s most obedient servant, alex. hamilton. general knox the confidence the army, a man sense. think he may be safely made use of. situated am, your excellency will feel the confidential nature these observations. his excellency general washington. duane hamilton. newburgh, 17th february, 1783. dear sir: am now a visit the general kingston, the legislature convened. the british king’s speech----to his parliament, his secretary’s letters the lord mayor london, which had the pleasure meeting here, afford the fairest prospect a speedy peace. have one anxiety remaining, respects a better establishment our general government a basis will secure the permanent union the states, a punctual payment the public debts. do not think our legislature will be averse a reasonable system. the assembly have agreed the requisitions congress, press the arrears taxes; a joint committee both houses have taken measures compel the immediate production the accounts all who have been intrusted public money. this last step became so necessary, found no difficulty getting adopted. would even hazard an attempt introduce an intendant, had proper materials; am disappointed not receiving the maryland plan, which promised mr. wright mr. homsly. possible, still wish would forward this act this subject, the collection taxes. the example a state may be adopted, any plan my own be rejected. there such confusion the present administration our state finances, the weight our debts so burthensome, a remedy must be provided; apprehend the production the public accounts, before alluded to, will furnish sufficient arguments prove its necessity. want the report, the evidence arguments support our territorial rights. if, proposed, have taken the trouble copy it, be so obliging transmit your copy. should your leisure not have been sufficient the undertaking, be pleased get transcribed forwarded. a collection great importance the state, should be lost, do not know who would submit the labor a second effort. general schuyler sent a week ago pay the last duties your grandfather. he wrote the tenth, there no hopes his surviving many days, learn he still living four days ago, without the least prospect recovery. your known punctuality, take granted have written agreeably your promise, your letters have miscarried. any communication, while the legislature convened, would be peculiarly acceptable, probably useful. be pleased present my respectful compliments colonel floyd, mrs. hamilton, mr. mrs. carter, the gentlemen our family, etc. the utmost regard, remain, dear sir, your affectionate most obedient humble servant, jas. duane. colonel alexander hamilton. hamilton governor clinton. february, 24, 1783 sir: my letter the fourteenth informed your excellency, congress employed devising a plan carrying the eighth article the confederation into execution. this business length brought a conclusion. inclose, the information the legislature, the proceedings upon different stages, which will see the part have acted. ultimately left a small minority, think my duty explain the motives upon which my opposition the general course the house founded. am opinion, the article the confederation itself ill-judged. the first place, do not believe there any general representative the wealth a nation, the criterion its ability pay taxes. there only two can be thought of, _land_ _numbers_. the revenues the united provinces (general particular) computed, before the present war, more than half much those great britain. the extent their territory not one-fourth part great; their population less than a third. the comparison still more striking between those provinces the swiss cantons; both which, extent territory population nearly the same; yet the revenues the former five times large those the latter; nor could any efforts taxation bring any thing like a level. both cases, the advantages agriculture superior those countries which afford least revenue proportion. have selected these examples because most familiar; whoever will extend the comparison between the nations the world, will perceive the position have laid down supported universal experience. the truth is, the ability a country pay taxes depends infinite combinations physical moral causes, which can never be accommodated any general rule; climate, soil, productions, advantages navigation, government, genius the people, progress arts industry, an endless variety circumstances. the diversities sufficiently great, these states, make an infinite difference their relative wealth; the proportion which can never be found any common measure whatever. the only possible way, then, making contribute the general expense, an equal proportion their means, general taxes imposed under continental authority. this mode, there would, no doubt, be inequalities, and, a considerable time, material ones; experience, the constant operation a general interest, which, the very collision particular interests, must, the main, prevail a continental deliberative, would length correct those inequalities, balance one tax should bear hard upon one state, another should have proportional weight others. this idea, however, not, the period framing the confederation, not yet, agreeable the spirit the time. futurity must leave the discovery, far this spirit wise foolish. one thing only now certain; congress, the discretionary power determining the quantum money be paid into the general treasury towards defraying the common expenses, have, effect, the constitutional power general taxation. the restraints upon the exercise this power, amount perpetuating a rule fixing the proportions, which must necessity produce inequality, and, refusing the federal government a power specific taxation collection, without substituting any other adequate means coercion, do, fact, leave the compliance continental requisitions the good will the respective states. inequality inherent the theory the confederation; and, the practice, inequality must increase proportion the honesty dishonesty the component parts. this vice will either, its consequences, reform the federal constitution, dissolve it. a general standard must be fixed, numbers preferable land. modes be devised ascertain the former tolerable precision; am persuaded the experiment will prove, the value all the land each state cannot be ascertained any thing like exactness. both these measures have the common disadvantage being no equal representative the wealth the people; one much more simple, definite, certain than the other. have indulged myself these remarks, show have little expectation success any mode carrying the article question into execution upon equitable principles. owe it, however, myself, declare, my opposition did not arise this source. the confederation pointed out this mode; and, though would heartily join a representation the difficulties (of which every man sense must be sensible examination) occur the execution the plan, induce the states consent a change, yet, this not the disposition a majority congress, would have assented any mode attempting which not either obviously mischievous impracticable. the first plan proposed, your excellency will see, an actual valuation each state itself. this evidently making the interested party judge his own cause. those who have seen the operation this principle between the counties the same state, the districts the same county, cannot doubt a moment the valuations this plan would have been altogether unequal unjust. without supposing more liberality one state than another, the degree care, judgment, method, employed the execution, would alone make extreme differences the results. this mode has, also, the further inconvenience awakening all the jealousies the several states against each other. each would suspect its neighbor had favored itself, whether the partiality appeared not. would be impossible silence these distrusts, make the states sit down satisfied the justice each other. every new requisition money would be a new signal discussion clamor; the seeds disunion, already sown too thick, would not be a little multiplied. guard against these evils, the plan proposes a revision congress; easy be seen such a power could not be exercised. should any states return defective valuations, would be difficult find sufficient evidence determine such. alter would not be admissible; congress could have no data which could be presumed equivalent those which must have governed the judgment commissioners under oath, an actual view the premises. do either this, reject, would be an impeachment the honor the states, which not probable there would be decision enough hazard; which, done, could not fail excite serious disgusts. there a wide difference between a single state exercising such a power over its own counties, a confederated government exercising over sovereign states which compose the confederacy. also happen, too many states would be interested the defective valuations, leave a sufficient number willing, either alter reject. these considerations prevailed prevent the plan being adopted a majority. the last plan may be less mischievous than the first; appears altogether ineffectual. the mere quantity land granted surveyed, the general species buildings upon them, can certainly be no criteria determine their value. the plan not even distinguish the improved the unimproved land; the qualities soil, degrees improvement: the quantities the houses other buildings, entirely omitted. these, seems, be judged the commissioners be appointed each state. am unable conceive, any commissioner can form the least estimate these circumstances respect even his own state, much less respect other states, which would be necessary establish a just relative value. even there a distinction improved unimproved land, supposing an intrinsic value the land, adopting general rates, something nearer the truth be attained; must now be all conjecture uncertainty. the numbers inhabitants, distinguishing white black, called for. this not only totally foreign the confederation, can answer no reasonable purpose. been said, the proportion numbers may guide correct the estimates. an assertion, purely verbal, no meaning. a judgment must first be formed the value the lands upon some principles. this should be altered the proportion numbers, plain numbers would be substituted land. another objection this plan is, lets the particular interests the states, operate the returns the quantities land, number buildings, number inhabitants. the principle this objection applies less forcibly here than against the former plan. whoever will consider the plain import the eighth article the confederation, must be convinced, intended an _actual_ _specific_ valuation land, buildings, improvements, not a mere general estimate, according the present plan. while insist, therefore, upon adhering the confederation, should do reality, not barely appearance. many those who voted this scheme, had bad an opinion myself; induced accede it, a persuasion some plan the purpose expected the states; none better, the present circumstances the country, could be fallen upon. a leading rule which have laid down the direction my conduct, this: while would have a just deference the expectations the states, would never consent amuse attempts which must either fail the execution, be productive evil. would rather incur the negative inconveniences delay than the positive mischiefs injudicious expedients. a contrary conduct serves destroy confidence the government, the greatest misfortune can befall a nation. there should, my opinion, be a character wisdom efficiency all the measures the federal council, the opposite a spirit temporizing concession. would have sufficient reliance the judgments the several states, hope good reasons not attempting a thing, would be more satisfactory than precipitate fruitless attempts. my idea is, that, taking granted the states will expect an experiment the principle the confederation, the best plan will be make commissioners appointed congress, acting under their authority. congress might, the first instance, appoint three more the principal characters each state probity abilities, a power nominate other commissioners under them, each subdivision the state. general principles be laid down the regulation their conduct, which uniformity the manner conducting the business would obtain. sanctions such solemnity be prescribed, such notoriety given every part the transaction, the commissioners could neither be careless nor partial without a sacrifice reputation. carry this plan, however, into effect, sufficient care accuracy, would be a work both time expense; and, unfortunately, so pressed find money calls immediate necessity, could not, present, undertake a measure which would require so large a sum. appears evident, every part a business which so important universal concern, should be transacted uniform principles, under the direction _body_ which a common interest. general, regard the present moment, probably the dawn peace, peculiarly critical; the measures which shall produce, great importance the future welfare these states. am, therefore, scrupulously cautious assenting plans which appear founded false principles. your excellency will observe, the valuation the lands be the standard adjusting the accounts, past supplies, between the united states the particular states. this, adhered to, without allowance the circumstances those states which have been more immediately the theatre the war, will charge our state the past, according its _future ability_, an entire condition, the valuation should be made after regain possession the parts the state now the power the enemy. have heretofore introduced a motion repeating the call, a more earnest manner, upon the states, vest congress a power making equitable abatements, agreeably the spirit the resolution the twentieth february last, which few the states have complied with. this motion been committed. know not what will be its fate. notwithstanding the opposition have given, now the matter been decided congress, hope the state will cheerfully comply what required. unless each state governed this principle, there an end the union. every state will, no doubt, have a right, this case, accompany its compliance such remarks may think proper. have the honor be, your excellency’s most ob’t servant, a. hamilton. p. s. after the plan agreed upon, committed be put into form; and, reported, instead commissioners, an alteration carried making the estimate a grand committee. february 27. mr. morris signified congress, his resolution resign the first june, adequate funds not time provided. this will be a severe stroke our affairs. no man, fit the office, will be willing supply his place, the very reason he resigns. ’tis happy have reasons expect a peace. am sorry that, different accounts, appears not have been concluded late december. his excellency governor clinton. governor clinton hamilton. kingston, february 24, 1783. sir: have been honored your letter the twelfth january. may remember, july last, submitted the consideration our legislature, certain resolutions the assembly new hampshire, making overtures an amicable settlement a boundary line between the two states; which read committed: the session short, devoted principally the particular business which convened, no determination had the subject. had some reason expect a consideration these resolutions would have taken place the present meeting. this induced defer answering your letter until could inform the result. cannot, however, discover any disposition take up this business. seems be the prevailing opinion, congress engaged make a final decision the controversy respecting the district called the grants, a partial compromise the matter would be improper; any measures the purpose, alienate the affections our most zealous subjects quarter, be attended other dangerous consequences. besides, doubts exist whether the legislature have authority, any act theirs, consent such a dismemberment the state would probably be insisted upon, a compromise new hampshire. am, nevertheless, still persuaded, should congress determine the summit the mountains be the boundary between the two states, this state (whatever our sentiments be the equity the decision) would, the sake peace, submit it: there cannot be a doubt, new hampshire would be perfectly satisfied the jurisdiction so extensive valuable a territory. take granted, that, whatever may be the decision, equitable measures will be adopted securing the property individuals. congratulate you, most sincerely, the promising prospects peace. pray nothing may prevent the desirable event soon taking place. our friends the city, long island, anxiously wait the moment which may return their homes. the expectations all so much raised obstruct public business not a little. please offer my best respects mrs. hamilton, believe me, great respect esteem, sir, your most obedient servant, geo. clinton. p. s. great concern mention, since writing the above, am informed the death your relation, colonel john van rensselaer. he departed this life friday last. general schuyler, who sent his recovery despaired of, set out albany his return this place wednesday next. g. c. alexander hamilton, esq. washington hamilton. newburgh, march 4, 1783. dear sir: have received your favor february, thank the information observations conveyed me. shall always think myself obliged a free communication sentiments, have often thought (but suppose thought wrong, did not accord the practice congress), the public interest be benefited, the commander-in-chief the army let more into the political pecuniary state our affairs than he is. enterprises, the adoption military other arrangements be exceedingly proper some circumstances, would be altogether improper others. follows, then, fair deduction, there a want information, there must be chance-medley; a man may be upon the brink a precipice before he aware his danger, a little foreknowledge enable him avoid it. this the by. the hint contained your letter, the knowledge have derived the public gazettes, respecting the non-payment taxes, contain all the information have received the danger stares the face account our funds; so far conceiving our finances so deplorable a state, _at this time_, had imbibed ideas some source other, that, the prospect a loan holland, should be able rub along. you, who have seen the danger which the army been exposed a political dissolution want subsistence, the unhappy spirit licentiousness which imbibed becoming, one two instances, its own proveditors, no observations necessary evince the fatal tendency such a measure; shall give my opinion, would this day be productive civil commotions end blood. unhappy situation this! god forbid should be involved it. the predicament which stand, citizen soldier, critical delicate can well be conceived. been the subject many contemplative hours. the sufferings a complaining army one hand, the inability congress, tardiness the states the other, the forebodings evil, may be productive events which more be deprecated than prevented: am not without hope, there such a disposition shown prudence policy dictate, do justice, your apprehensions, case peace, greater than there cause for. this, however, may be mistaken, those ideas which have been informed propagated the army, should be extensive, the source which may be easily traced; the old leaven, _it said_, have no proof it, again beginning work, under the mask the most perfect dissimulation apparent cordiality. be these things may, shall pursue the same steady line conduct which governed hitherto; fully convinced, the sensible discerning part the army cannot be unacquainted (although never took pains inform them) the services have rendered more occasions than one. this, pursuing the suggestions your letter, which am happy find coincide my own practice several months past, which the means directing the business the army into the channel now is, leave under no _great_ apprehension its exceeding the bounds reason moderation; notwithstanding the prevailing sentiment the army is, the prospect compensation past services will terminate the war. the just claims the army ought, be hoped will, have their weight every sensible legislature the union, congress point their demands; show (if the case so) the reasonableness them; the impracticability complying without their aid. any other point view, would, my opinion, be impolitic introduce the army the tapis, lest should excite jealousy bring its concomitants. the states cannot, surely, be so devoid common sense, common honesty, common policy, refuse their aid, a full, clear, candid representation facts congress; more especially, these should be enforced members their own body, who demonstrate what the inevitable consequences failure must lead to. my opinion a matter worthy consideration, far an adjournment congress a few months advisable. the delegates, case, unison themselves respecting the great defects their constitution, may represent fully boldly their constituents. me, who know nothing the business which before congress, nor the arcanum, appears such a measure would tend promote the public weal: clearly my opinion, unless congress have powers competent all _general_ purposes, the distresses have encountered, the expenses have incurred, the blood have spilt, the course an eight years’ war, will avail nothing. the contents your letter known only myself; your prudence will direct what should be done this. great esteem regard, am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton, esq. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 5, 1783. sir: had the honor writing your excellency lately a very confidential subject, shall be anxious know, soon convenient, whether the letter got safe hand. the bearer, shattuck, thinks he can point out means apprehending wells knowlton, the two persons whom your excellency authorized have taken into custody. have desired him call upon disclose the plan. will not trouble your excellency any observation the importance getting hold those persons. the surmise mr. arnold, a member congress, gave intelligence the design take them, makes peculiarly important. have the honor be, your excellency’s most ob’t serv’t, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. washington hamilton. newburgh, march 12, 1783. dear sir: wrote last, a state tranquillity; after the arrival a certain gentleman, who shall be nameless present, philadelphia, a storm very suddenly arose, unfavorable prognostics; which, though diverted a moment, not yet blown over; nor my power point the issue. the papers which send officially congress, will supersede the necessity my remarking the tendency them. the notification address, both, appeared the same instant, the day preceding the intended meeting. the first these got hold the same afternoon; the other not till next morning. there something very mysterious this business. appears reports have been propagated philadelphia, dangerous combinations forming the army; this a time there not a syllable the kind agitation camp. also appears, upon the arrival camp the gentleman above alluded to, such sentiments these immediately circulated: universally expected the army would not disband until had obtained justice; the public creditors looked up redress their own grievances; would afford every aid, even join the field, necessary; some members congress wished the measure take effect, order compel the public, particularly the delinquent states, do justice; many other suggestions a similar nature. this, a variety other considerations, firmly believed _some_, the scheme not only planned, also digested matured, philadelphia;[19] my opinion shall be suspended till have better ground found one on. the matter managed great art; soon the minds the officers thought be prepared the transaction, the anonymous invitations addresses the officers put circulation through every state line the army. obliged, therefore, order arrest the spot, the feet stood wavering a tremendous precipice, prevent the officers being taken surprise, while the passions all inflamed, rescue plunging themselves into a gulf civil horror which there be no receding, issue the order the eleventh. this done upon the principle easier divert a wrong, point a right path, than recall the hasty fatal steps which have been already taken. commonly supposed, the officers had met agreeably the anonymous summons, their feelings all alive, resolutions have been formed, the consequences which may be more easily conceived than described. now will have leisure view the matter more calmly, will act more seriously. be hoped will be induced adopt more rational measures, wait a while longer a settlement their accounts, the postponing which appears be the most plausible, almost the only article which designing men can make an improper use, insinuating (which really do) done design peace may take place, prevent any adjustment accounts; which, say they, would inevitably be the case, the war cease to-morrow: or, supposing the best, would have dance attendance public offices, great distances, perhaps, equally great expenses, obtain a settlement, which would be highly injurious, nay, ruinous you. this their language. let beseech you, therefore, my good sir, urge this matter earnestly, without further delay. the situation these gentlemen, do verily believe, distressing beyond description. affirmed me, a large part have no better prospect before than a jail, turned loose without liquidation accounts, an assurance justice which so worthily entitled. prevail the delegates those states, through whose means these difficulties occur, may, my opinion, propriety be suggested them, any disastrous consequences should follow, reason their delinquency, must be answerable god their country the ineffable horrors which may be occasioned thereby. am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. p. s. have received your letter the fifth, have put matter train which mentioned it. g. w. am this instant informed, a second address the officers, distinguished no. 2, thrown into circulation. the contents evidently prove, the author in, near, camp; the following words, erased the second page this letter, ought not have met this treatment, viz.--“by others, the illegitimate offspring a person the army.” [19] the words, “by others, the illegitimate offspring a person the army,” which came here, obliterated the original, restored washington the _postscript_. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 17, 1783. sir: am duly honored your excellency’s letters the fourth twelfth instant. much be regretted, though not be wondered at, steps so inflammatory a tendency have been taken the army. your excellency has, my opinion, acted wisely. the best way is, ever, not attempt stem a torrent, divert it. am happy find coincide opinion the conduct proper be observed yourself. am persuaded, more more, which most consistent your own reputation the public safety. our affairs wear a most serious aspect, well foreign domestic. before this gets hand, your excellency will probably have seen the provisional articles between great britain these states. might, first appearance, be concluded, these will be the prelude a general peace; there strong reasons doubt the truth such a conclusion. obstacles may arise different quarters; the demands spain holland; the hope, france, greater acquisitions the east; and, perhaps, still more probably, the insincerity duplicity lord shelburne, whose politics, founded the peculiarity his situation, well the character the man, may well be suspected insidiousness. am really apprehensive, peace not take place, the negotiations will tend sow distrust among the allies, weaken the force the common league. have, fear, men among us, men trust, who have a hankering after british connection. have others whose confidence france savors credulity. the intrigues the former, the incautiousness the latter, may be both, though different degrees, injurious the american interests, make difficult prudent men steer a proper course. there delicate circumstances, respect the late foreign transactions, which am not liberty reveal; which, joined our internal weaknesses, disorders, follies, prejudices, make this country stand upon precarious ground. some use, perhaps, may be made these ideas, induce moderation the army. an opinion their country not stand upon a secure footing, will operate upon the patriotism the officers against hazarding any domestic commotions. make these observations, cannot forbear adding, no excesses take place, shall not be sorry ill-humors have appeared. shall not regret importunity, temperate, the army. there good intentions the majority congress, there not sufficient wisdom decision. there dangerous prejudices, the particular states, opposed those measures which alone can give stability prosperity the union. there a fatal opposition continental views. necessity alone can work a reform. produce necessity, apply it, keep within salutary bounds? fear have been contending a shadow. the affair accounts considered having been put a satisfactory footing. the particular states have been required settle till the first august, ’80; the superintendent finance been directed take measures settling since period. shall immediately see him the subject. have had eight states a half favor a commutation the half pay an average ten years’ purchase; is, five years’ full pay instead half pay life, which, a calculation annuities, nearly an equivalent. hope this will now shortly take place. have made considerable progress a plan be recommended the several states funding all the public debts, including those the army; which certainly the only way restore public credit, enable continue the war borrowing abroad, should be necessary, continue it. omitted mentioning your excellency, that, european intelligence, there great reason believe, all events, peace war, new-york will be evacuated the spring. will be a pity any domestic disturbances should change the plans the british court. have the honor be, the greatest respect, your excellency’s most ob’t serv’t, a. hamilton. p. s. your excellency mentions, been surmised, the plan agitation formed philadelphia; combinations have been talked between the public creditors the army; members congress had encouraged the idea. this partly true. have myself urged, congress, the propriety uniting the influence the public creditors, the army, a part them, prevail upon the states enter into their views. have expressed the same sentiments out doors. several other members congress have done the same. the meaning, however, all this, simply, congress should adopt such a plan would embrace the relief all the public creditors, including the army; order the personal influence some, the connections others, a sense justice the army, well the apprehension ill consequences, form a mass influence, each state, favor the measures congress. this view, mentioned your excellency a former letter, thought the discontents the army be turned a good account. am still opinion, their earnest respectful applications redress will have a good effect. any combination _force_, would only be productive the horrors a civil war, end the ruin the country, would certainly end the ruin the army. a. h. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 24, 1783. sir: your excellency will, before this reaches you, have received a letter the marquis de la fayette, informing you, the preliminaries peace between all the belligerent powers have been concluded. congratulate your excellency this happy conclusion your labors. now only remains make solid establishments within, perpetuate our union, prevent our being a ball the hands european powers, banded against each other their pleasure; fine, make our independence truly a blessing. this, be lamented, will be an arduous work; for, borrow a figure mechanics, the centrifugal much stronger than the centripetal force these states; the seeds disunion much more numerous than those union. will add, your excellency’s exertions essential accomplish this end, have been establish independence. will, upon a future occasion, open myself upon this subject. your conduct the affair the officers highly pleasing here. the measures the army such could have wished them, will add new lustre their character, well strengthen the hands congress. am, great truth respect, your excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 25, 1783. sir: wrote your excellency a day two ago express. since that, a committee, appointed the communications you, have had a meeting, find themselves embarrassed. have requested communicate our embarrassments confidence, ask your private opinion. the army, their resolutions, express an expectation congress will not disband previous a settlement accounts, the establishment funds. congress may resolve upon the first, the general opinion is, cannot constitutionally declare the second. have no right, the confederation, _demand_ funds; can only recommend: determine, the army shall be continued service till the states grant them, would be determine, the whole present army shall be a standing army during peace, unless the states comply the requisition funds. this, supposed, would excite the alarms jealousies the states, increase, rather than lessen, the opposition the funding scheme. also observed, the longer the army kept together, the more the payment past dues procrastinated; the abilities the states being exhausted their immediate support, a new debt every day incurred. further suggested, there danger keeping the army together, a state inactivity, a separation the several lines would facilitate the settlement accounts, diminish present expense, avoid the danger union. added, the officers each line, being the spot, might, their own solicitations, those their friends, forward the adoption funds the different states. a proposition will be transmitted colonel bland, the form a resolution, be adopted congress, framed upon the principles the foregoing reasoning. another proposition contained the following resolution: “that the commander-in-chief be informed, the intention congress effect the settlement the accounts the respective lines previous their reduction; congress doing, will continue do, every thing their power towards procuring satisfactory securities what shall be found due such settlement.” the scope this your excellency will perceive without comment. am request will favor your sentiments both the propositions; and, general, your ideas what had best be done reference the expectation expressed the officers; taking into view the situation congress. one side, the army expect they will not be disbanded till accounts settled funds established. the other hand, they have no constitutional power doing any thing more than recommend funds, persuaded these will meet mountains prejudice some the states. a considerable progress been made a plan funding the public debts; be hoped will ere long go forth the states, every argument can give success. have the honor be, sincere respect, your excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 25, 1783. sir: the inclosed write more a public than a private capacity. here write a citizen, zealous the true happiness this country; a soldier who feels what due an army which suffered every thing, done much the safety america. sincerely wish _ingratitude_ not so natural the human heart is. sincerely wish there no seeds those who direct the councils the united states. while urge the army moderation, advise your excellency take the direction their discontents, endeavor confine within the bounds duty, cannot, an honest man, conceal you, am afraid their distrusts have too much foundation. republican jealousy a principle hostility an army, whatever be their merits, whatever be their claims the gratitude the community. acknowledges their services unwillingness, rewards reluctance. see this temper, though smothered great care, involuntarily breaking out upon too many occasions. often feel a mortification, which would be impolitic express, sets my passions variance my reason. too many, perceive, they could do safety color, would be glad elude the just pretensions the army. hope this not the prevailing disposition. supposing the country ungrateful, what can the army do? must submit its hard fate. seek redress its arms would end its ruin. the army would moulder its own weight, want the means keeping together: the soldiery would abandon their officers: there would be no chance success, without having recourse means would reverse our revolution. make these observations, not imagine your excellency can want motives continue your influence the path moderation; merely show cannot, myself, enter into the views coercion which some gentlemen entertain. confess, could force avail, should almost wish see employed. have an indifferent opinion the honesty this country, ill forebodings its future system. your excellency will perceive have written sensations chagrin, will make allowance coloring: the general picture too true. god send all more wisdom. am, very sincere respect, your excellency’s obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. washington hamilton. newburgh, march 31, 1783. dear sir: have duly received your favors the seventeenth twenty-fourth ultimo. rejoice, most exceedingly, there an end our warfare; such a field opening our view, will, wisdom direct the cultivation it, make a great, a respectable, happy people: must be improved other means than state politics unreasonable jealousies prejudices; (it requires not the second sight see that) shall be instruments the hands our enemies, those european powers who may be jealous our greatness union, dissolve the confederation. attain this, although the way seems extremely plain, not so easy. my wish see the union these states established upon liberal permanent principles, inclination contribute my mite pointing out the defects the present constitution, equally great. all my private letters have teemed these sentiments; whenever this topic been the subject conversation, have endeavored diffuse enforce them; far any further essay, me, be productive the wished end, appear arrogate more than belongs me, depends so much upon popular opinion, the temper disposition people, not easy decide. shall be obliged you, however, the thoughts which have promised this subject, soon can make convenient. no man the united states, is, can be, more deeply impressed the necessity a reform our present confederation, than myself; no man, perhaps, felt the bad effects more sensibly: for, the defects thereof; want powers congress, may justly be ascribed the prolongation the war, and, consequently, the expenses occasioned it. more than half the perplexities have experienced the course my command, almost the whole the difficulties distress the army, have their origin here: still, the prejudices some, the designs others, the mere machinery the majority, make address management necessary, give weight opinions which combat the doctrines these different classes men, the field politics. would have been more full this subject, the bearer (in the clothing department) waiting. wish may understand what have written. am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. washington hamilton. newburgh, april 4, 1783. dear sir: the same post which gave your two letters the twenty-fifth march, handed one colonel bland the same point. observing both have been written the desire a committee which both members, have made a very full reply their subject my letter which addressed colonel bland; and, supposing unnecessary enter into a complete detail both, must beg leave refer colonel bland’s (a sight which have desired him give you), a full explanation my ideas sentiments. read your private letter the twenty-fifth pain, contemplated the picture had drawn astonishment horror: will yet hope the best. the idea redress, force, is too chimerical have had a place the imagination any serious mind this army; there is no telling what unhappy disturbances may result distress, distrust justice: the fears jealousies the army alive, hope no resolution will be come to, disbanding separating the lines, till the accounts liquidated. may rely upon it, sir, unhappy consequences would follow the attempt. the suspicions the officers afloat, notwithstanding the resolutions which have passed both sides. any act, therefore, which can be construed into an attempt separate before the accounts settled, will convey the most unfavorable ideas the rectitude congress: whether well ill founded, matters not; the consequences will be the same. will now, strict confidence, mention a matter which may be useful be informed of. is, some men (and leading ones, too) this army, beginning entertain suspicions congress, some members it, regardless the past sufferings present distress, maugre the justice which is due them, the returns which a grateful people should make men who certainly have contributed, more than any other class, the establishment independency, be made use mere puppets establish continental funds; that, rather than not succeed this measure, weaken their ground, they would make a sacrifice the army all its interests. have two reasons mentioning this matter you: the one is, the army (considering the irritable state is in, its sufferings, composition) is a dangerous instrument play with; the other, every possible means, consistent their own views (which certainly moderate), should be essayed get disbanded without delay. add a third: is, the financier is suspected be the bottom this scheme. sentiments this sort should become general, their operation will be opposed this plan, the same time would increase the present discontents. upon the whole, disband the army soon possible, consult the wishes it, which really moderate the mode, perfectly compatible the honor, dignity, justice, which is due the country it. am, great esteem regard, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. hamilton washington. april 11, 1783. sir: have received your excellency’s letters the thirty-first march, fourth april; the last to-day. the one colonel bland, member the committee, been read committee confidentially, gave great satisfaction. the idea not attempting separate the army before the settlement accounts, corresponds my proposition. endeavoring let have some pay, had also appeared indispensable. the expectations the army, represented your excellency, moderation itself. to-morrow confer the superintendent finance the subject money. there will be difficulty, not, hope, insurmountable. thank your excellency the hints so obliging give your private letter. do not wonder the suspicions have been infused; nor should be surprised hear, have been pointed out one the persons concerned playing the game described. facts must speak themselves. the gentlemen who here the army, general mcdougal, who is still here, will be able give a true account those who have supported the just claims the army, those who have endeavored elude them. there two classes men, sir, congress, very different views: one attached state, the other continental politics. the last have been strenuous advocates funding the public debt upon solid securities; the former have given every opposition their power; have only been dragged into the measures which now near being adopted, the clamors the army other public creditors. the advocates continental funds, have blended the interests the army other creditors, a conviction, no funds, partial purposes, will go through those states whose citizens the united states largely indebted; they should be carried through, impressions the moment, would have the necessary stability: the influence those unprovided for, would always militate against a provision others, exclusion them. is vain tell men, who have parted a large part their property the public faith, the services the army entitled a preference: they would reason their interest their feelings: these would tell them, they had great a title any other class the community public justice; while this denied them, would be unreasonable make bear their part a burthen the benefit others. this is the way they would reason; their influence some the states was considerable, they would have been able prevent any partial provision. the question was not merely do justice the creditors, restore public credit. taxation, this country, was found, would not supply a sixth part the public necessities. the loans europe far short the balance, the prospect every day diminishing; the court france telling us, plain terms, she could not even do much she had done; individuals holland, every else, refusing part their money, the precarious tenure the mere faith this country, without any pledge the payment either principal interest. this situation what was be done? was essential our cause, vigorous efforts should be made restore public credit; was necessary combine all the motives this end, could operate upon different descriptions persons the different states: the necessities discontents the army presented themselves a powerful engine. but, sir, these gentlemen would be puzzled support their insinuations a single fact. was, indeed, proposed appropriate the intended impost trade the army debt; and, what was extraordinary, gentlemen who had expressed their dislike the principle the fund. acknowledge was one opposed this, the reasons already assigned, these additional ones: _that_ was the fund which most counted; obtain further loans europe, was necessary should have a fund sufficient pay the interest what had been borrowed, what was be borrowed. the truth was, these people, this instance, wanted play off the army against the funding system. mr. morris, will give your excellency a true explanation his conduct. he had been some time pressing congress endeavor obtain funds, had found a great backwardness the business. he found the taxes unproductive the different states; he found the loans, europe, making a very slow progress; he found himself pressed all hands supplies; he found himself, short, reduced this alternative, either making engagements which he could not fulfil, declaring his resignation case funds not established a given time. had he followed the first course, the bubble must soon have burst; he must have sacrificed his credit his character: public credit, already a ruinous condition, would have lost its last support. he wisely judged better resign: this might increase the embarrassments the moment; the necessity the case, was be hoped, would produce the proper measures; he might then resume the direction the machine advantage success. he also had some hope his resignation would prove a stimulus congress. he was, however, ill advised the publication his letters resignation. this was an imprudent step, given a handle his personal enemies, who, playing upon the passions others, have drawn some well-meaning men into the cry against him. mr. morris certainly deserves a great deal his country. believe no man this country, himself, could have kept the money machine agoing during the period he been office. every thing appears, his administration been upright well able. the truth is, the old leaven deane lee, is, this day, working against mr. morris. he happened, dispute, have been the side deane; certain men can never forgive him. a man whom once esteemed, whom will rather suppose _duped_ than wicked, is the second actor this business. the matter, respect the army, which occasioned most altercation congress, most dissatisfaction the army, been the half pay. the opinions this head have been two: one party was referring the several lines their states, make such commutation they should think proper; the other, making the commutation congress, funding continental security. was this last opinion; so all those who will be represented having made use the army puppets. our principal reasons were, _firstly_: referring the lines their respective states, those which opposed the half pay, would have taken advantage the officers’ necessities, make the commutation far short an equivalent. _secondly_: the inequality which would have arisen the different states the officers came compare (as happened other cases), would have been a new source discontent. _thirdly_: such a reference was a continuance the old wretched state system, which the ties between congress the army have been nearly dissolved; which the resources the states have been diverted the common treasury, wasted; a system which your excellency often justly reprobated. have gone these details, give a just idea the parties congress. assure you, upon my honor, sir, have given a candid state facts, the best my judgment. the men against whom the suspicions mention must be directed, are, general, the most sensible, the most liberal, the most independent, the most respectable characters our body, well the most unequivocal friends the army. a word, they the men who think continentally. have the honor be, sincere respect esteem, your excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. p. s. am chairman a committee peace arrangements. shall ask your excellency’s opinion large, a proper military peace establishment. will just hint your excellency, our prejudices will make wish keep up few troops possible. this moment learn, an officer is arrived sir guy carleton dispatches; probably official accounts peace. a. h. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. philadelphia, april 15, 1783. sir: there two resolutions passed relative the restoration the british prisoners, making arrangements the surrender the posts the possession the british troops; the first which is be transacted conjunction the secretary war; the latter yourself alone. will explain some doubts which have arisen congress, regard the true construction the provisional treaty; which may be use transacting the business above-mentioned. the sixth article declares, there shall be no future confiscations, etc., after the _ratification the treaty america_; the seventh article makes the surrender prisoners, evacuation posts, cessation hostilities, etc., depend event, wit, _the ratification the treaty america_. now the doubt is, whether _the treaty_ means the provisional treaty _already concluded_, the _definitive_ treaty _to be concluded_. the last construction is most agreeable the letter the provisional articles; the former, most agreeable the usual practice nations: hostilities commonly cease the ratification the preliminary treaty. there is a great diversity opinion congress. will be, my opinion, advisable, the same time do not communicate our doubts the british, extract their sense the matter them. this may be done asking them, what periods they willing stipulate the surrender posts; the same time they asked, what manner will be the most convenient receive the prisoners. they postpone the evacuation the different posts the definitive treaty, shall then be justified doing the same respect prisoners. the question will then arise, whether, principles humanity, economy, liberality, ought not restore the prisoners, all events, without delay? much may be said both sides. doubt the expedience a total restoration prisoners, till they willing fix the epochs which they will take leave us. will add considerably their strength; accidents, though improbable, may happen. confess, however, am not clear my opinion. have the honor be, your excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. p.s. the provisional preliminary treaty, is ratified us--for the greater caution. a. h. his excellency general washington. washington hamilton. newborgh, april 16, 1783. dear sir: my last letter was written a hurry, was fatigued the more public, yet confidential, letter, which (with several others) accompanied it. possibly, did not, occasion, express myself (in what intended a hint) so much perspicuity ought: possibly, too, what then dropped, might have conveyed more than intended; do not, this time, recollect the force my expression. my meaning, however, was only inform, there different sentiments the army, well congress, respecting continental state funds: some wishing be thrown upon their respective states, rather than the continent large, payment; that, an idea should prevail, generally, congress, part its members, ministers, bent upon the latter, should _delay_ doing justice, _hazard_ pursuit their favorite object; might create such divisions the army, would weaken, rather than strengthen, the hands those who disposed support continental measures; might _tend_ defeat the end they themselves had view endeavoring involve the army. these reasons said, meant say, the army was a dangerous engine work with, might be made cut both ways; and, considering the sufferings it, would, more than probably, throw its weight into scale which seemed most likely preponderate towards its immediate relief, without looking forward (under the pressure present wants) future consequences the eyes politicians. this light, also, meant apply my observations mr. morris, whom, rather mr. g---- m----, is ascribed, a great degree, the groundwork the superstructure which was intended be raised the army the anonymous addresses. no man can be more opposed state funds local prejudices than myself, the whole tenor my conduct been one continual evidence of. no man, perhaps, had better opportunities _see_, _feel_, the pernicious tendency the latter than have; endeavor (i hope not altogether ineffectually) inculcate them upon the officers the army, upon all proper occasions: their feelings be attended soothed; they assured, continental funds cannot be established, they will be recommended their respective states payment. justice must be done them. should do injustice reports, what believe be the opinion the army, not inform you, they consider a friend, zealous serve them, one who espoused their interests congress, upon every proper occasion. is be wished, observed my letter colonel bland, congress would send a committee the army plenipotentiary powers. the matters requested me, your letter the chairman a committee, many other things, might then be brought a close, more despatch, a happier manner, than is likely they will be an intercourse letters the distance one hundred fifty miles: which takes _our_ expresses, a week, _at least_, go come. this moment, being without any instructions congress, am under great embarrassment respect the soldiers the war; shall be obliged, more than probably, the necessity the case, exercise my own judgment without waiting orders, the discharge them. should adopt measures which events may approve, all will be well. otherwise, what authority did do so? far a _strong_ recommendation congress, observe _all_ the articles peace, well the may imply a suspicion good faith the people this country, pretend not judge: am much mistaken, something the kind will not be found wanting; already perceive a disposition carp at, elude, such parts the treaty affect their different interests; although do not find a man, who, pushed, will not acknowledge, that, upon the _whole_, is a more advantageous peace than could possibly have expected. am, dear sir, great esteem regard, your most obedient servant, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. washington hamilton. newburgh, april 22, 1783. dear sir: did not receive your letter the fifteenth, till after my return ringwood, had a meeting the secretary war, the purpose making arrangements the release our prisoners, agreeably the resolve congress the fifteenth instant. finding a diversity opinion respecting the treaty, the line conduct ought observe the prisoners, requested, precise terms, know general lincoln (before entered the business), whether exercise our own judgment respect the _time_, well the _mode_, releasing them; be confined the latter: being informed had no option the first, congress wishing be eased the expense soon possible, acted _solely_ ground. the same time, scruple not confess you, this measure was not dictated necessity, is, my opinion, an impolitic one; place ourselves the power the british, before the treaty is definitive. the manner which peace was first announced, the subsequent declarations it, have led the country army into a belief, was final. the ratification the preliminary articles, the third february, so far confirmed this, one consequence resulting it, is, the soldiers the war, conceive the term their services actually expired; believe is not the power congress, their officers, hold them much, any, longer; obliged, this moment, increase our guards, prevent rioting, the insults which the officers meet with, attempting hold them their duty. the proportion these men, amount seven-elevenths this army: these shall lose the moment the british army will receive, their prisoners, an augmentation five six thousand men. is not investigate the causes which induced this measure; nor the policy those letters (from authority) which gave the _ton_ the present sentiment; since they have been adopted, ought, my opinion, put a good face upon matters; and, a liberal conduct throughout, our part (freed appearances distrust) try cannot excite similar dispositions theirs. indeed, circumstanced things _now_ are, wish, most fervently, all the troops which not retained a peace establishment, be discharged immediately, such them, least, do not incline await the settlement their accounts. they continue here, their claims, can plainly perceive, will increase; our perplexities multiply. a petition is this moment handed me, the non-commissioned officers the connecticut line, soliciting half pay. is well drawn, am told, did not read it. sent back, without appearing understand the contents, because did not come through the channel their officers. this may be followed others: mention it, show the necessity, the absolute necessity, discharging the _warsmen_ soon possible. have taken much pains support mr. morris’s administration the army; and, proportion its numbers, believe he had not more friends any where: he will neither adopt the mode which been suggested, point out any other, nor show cause why the first is either impracticable impolitic (i have heard he objects it), they will certainly attribute their disappointment a lukewarmness him, some design incompatible their interests. here, my dear colonel hamilton, let assure you, would not be more difficult still the raging billows a tempestuous gale, than convince the officers this army, the justice, policy, paying men, civil offices, full wages, _they_ cannot obtain a sixtieth part their dues. am not unapprised the arguments which made use of, upon this occasion, discriminate the cases: they really futile; may be summed up this: though both are contending the same rights, expect equal benefits, yet, both cannot submit the same inconveniences obtain them: otherwise, adopt the language simplicity plainness, a ration salt pork, without pease, the case often is, would support the one well the other; and, such a struggle ours, would, my opinion, be alike honorable both. my anxiety get home, increases the prospect it. is happen? have not heard congress have yet had under consideration, the lands, other gratuities, which, different periods the war, have been promised the army. do not these things evince the necessity a committee’s repairing camp, order arrange adjust matters without spending time a tedious exchange letters? unless something this kind is adopted, business will be delayed, expenses accumulated; the army will break up disorder, go home enraged, complaining injustice, committing enormities the innocent inhabitants every direction. write unreservedly. if, therefore, contrary my apprehension, all these matters are a proper train, mr. morris devised means give the army three months’ pay, will, am persuaded, excuse my precipitancy solicitude, ascribing an earnest wish see the war happily honorably terminated; my anxious desire enjoying some repose; the necessity my paying a little attention my private concerns, which have suffered considerably eight years’ absence. m’henry, expressing, a letter have lately received him, a wish be appointed official secretary the court versailles, london, have, this opportunity, written mr. livingston, mr. madison, speaking him warm terms; wish him success all my heart. am, dear sir, great esteem regard, your most obedient servant, g. washington. colonel hamilton. hamilton gov. clinton. philadelphia, may 14, 1783. sir: the president congress will course have transmitted your excellency, the plan lately adopted congress funding the public debt. this plan was framed accommodate the objections some the states; this spirit accommodation will only serve render less efficient, without making more palatable. the opposition the state rhode island, instance, is chiefly founded upon these two considerations: the merchants are opposed any revenue trade; the state, depending almost wholly commerce, wants have credit the amount the duties. persuaded the plan now proposed will have little more chance success than a better one; that, agreed all the states, will, a great measure, fail the execution, received my negative. my principal objections were, _firstly_: not designate the funds (except the impost) which the whole interest is arise; which (selecting the capital articles visible property) the collection would have been easy, the funds productive, necessarily increasing the increase the country. _secondly_: the duration the funds is not coextensive the debt, limited twenty-five years; though there is a moral certainty, that, period, the principal will not, the present provision, be fairly extinguished. _thirdly_: the nomination appointment the collectors the revenue are reside each state, instead of, least the nomination, being the united states; the consequence which will be, those states which have little interest the funds, having a small share the public debt due their own citizens, will take care appoint such persons are least likely collect the revenue. the evils resulting these defects, will be, many instances the objects the revenues will be improperly chosen, will consist a multitude little articles, which will, experiment, prove insufficient; want a vigorous collection each state, the revenue will be unproductive many, will fall chiefly upon those states which are governed most liberal principles; want an adequate security, the evidences the public debt, will not be transferable any thing like their value; this not admitting an incorporation the creditors the nature banks, will deprive the public the benefit an increased circulation, course will disable the people paying the taxes want a sufficient medium. shall be happy be mistaken my apprehensions; the experiment must determine. hope our state will consent the plan proposed; because is her interest, all events, promote the payment the public debt continental funds (independent the general considerations union propriety). am much mistaken the debts due the united states the citizens the state new-york, do not considerably exceed its proportion the necessary funds: course has an immediate interest there should be a continental provision them. there are superior motives ought operate every state; the obligations national faith, honor, reputation. individuals have been already too long sacrificed public convenience. will be shocking, indeed an eternal reproach this country, begin the peaceable enjoyment our independence a violation all the principles honesty true policy. is worthy remark, least four-fifths the domestic debt, are due the citizens the states (from pennsylvania inclusively) northward. have the honor be, sir, your most obedient servant, a. hamilton. p. s. is particularly interesting the state should have a representation here. not only many matters are depending which require a full representation congress (and there is now a thin one), those matters are a nature so particularly interesting our state, ought not be without a voice them. wish two other gentlemen the delegation may appear soon possible; would be very injurious remain much longer here. having no future views public life, owe myself, without delay enter upon the care my private concerns earnest. a. h. his excellency governor clinton. hamilton governor clinton. philadelphia, june 1, 1783. sir: my last letter your excellency, took occasion mention, was great importance the state, this time, have a representation here, points which, its present situation, is particularly interested, are daily, will be daily, agitated. is also importance, this moment, the united states; (not only general considerations, but) because we have a very thin representation congress, are frequently unable transact any those matters which require nine states. wish your excellency would urge a couple gentlemen come on, becomes highly inconvenient remain here, have staid the full time be expected. observe, great regret, the intemperate proceedings among the people different parts the state, violation a treaty, the faithful observance which so deeply interests the united states. surely, the state new-york, its capital its frontier posts (on which its important fur trade depends) the hands the british troops, ought take care nothing is done furnish a pretext the other side, even delaying, much less refusing, the execution the treaty. we may imagine the situation great britain puts her under a necessity, all events, fulfilling her engagements, cultivating the good will this country. this is, no doubt, her true policy; we feel passion makes depart the dictates reason; we have seen passion has had so much influence the conduct the british councils, the whole course the war; we recollect, those who govern them, are men like ourselves, alike subject passions resentments; we reflect, also, all the great men england are not united the liberal scheme policy respect this country, the anarchy which prevails, there is no knowing whom the reins government may be committed; we recollect little a condition we are, enforce a compliance our claims; we ought, certainly, be cautious what manner we act, especially we, particular, have so much stake; should not openly provoke a breach faith the other side, setting the example. an important distinction is not sufficiently attended to. the fifth article is recommendatory; the sixth positive. there is no option, the part the particular states, any future confiscations, prosecutions, injuries any kind, person, liberty, property, account any thing done the war. is matter discretion the states, whether they will comply the recommendations contained the fifth article; no part the sixth can be departed them, without a direct breach public faith, the confederation. the power making treaties is exclusively lodged congress. power includes whatever is essential the termination the war, the preservation the general safety. indemnity individuals similar cases, is a _usual_ stipulation treaties peace, which many precedents are be produced. should be said, the associations the people, without legal authority, do not amount a breach the public faith; the answer is, the government not repress them, prevent their having effect, is much a breach, a formal refusal comply its part. the eye a foreign nation, our engagements are broken, is no moment whether is the want good intention the government, want power restrain its subjects. suppose a violence committed an american vessel the vessel another nation, upon the high seas, after complaint made there is no redress given: is not this a hostility against the injured nation which will justify reprisals? am not misinformed, there are violations going form law. am told indictments continue be brought under the former confiscation laws: a palpable infraction, true, the sixth article the treaty; which an immediate stop ought, no doubt, be put. has been said some men, the operation this treaty is suspended till the definitive treaty: a plain subterfuge. whatever is clearly expressed the provisional preliminary treaty, is binding the moment is made, the definitive treaty; which, fact, only developes, explains fixes, more precisely, what may have been too generally expressed the former. suppose the british should now send away, not only the negroes, all other property, all the public records their possession belonging us, the pretence above stated: should we not justly accuse them breaking faith? is this not already done the case the negroes who have been carried away, though founded upon a very different principle, a doubtful construction the treaty, not a denial its immediate operation? fine, is our interest advance this doctrine, countenance the position, nothing is binding till the definitive treaty, there are examples _years_ intervening between the preliminary definitive treaties? sir guy carleton, his correspondence, has appeared consider the treaty immediately obligatory: has been the policy which have pursued, promote the same idea. am not, indeed, apprehensive a renewal the war, peace is necessary great britain. think also most probable, her disposition conciliate this country will outweigh the resentments which a breach our engagements is calculated inspire. a treaty which has exceeded the hopes the most sanguine; which, the articles boundary the fisheries, is even better than we asked; circumstanced, too, this country is, respect the means making war; think the height imprudence run any risk. great britain, without recommencing hostilities, may evade parts the treaty. she may keep possession the frontier posts; she may obstruct the free enjoyment the fisheries; she may be indisposed such extensive concessions, matters commerce, is our interest aim at. all this she would find no opposition any foreign power: we are not a condition oblige her any thing. we imagine france, obviously embarrassed herself, her finances, would renew the war oblige great britain the restoration frontier posts; a compliance the stipulations respecting the fisheries (especially after a manifest breach the treaty our part); we speculate much random. observations might be made the last article, which would prove, is not the policy france support our interest there. are we prepared, the mere gratification our resentments, put those great national objects the hazard; leave our western frontier a state insecurity; relinquish the fur trade; abridge our pretensions the fisheries? do we think national character so light a thing, be willing sacrifice the public faith individual animosity? let the case be fairly stated: great britain america, two independent nations, war. the former possession considerable posts districts territory, belonging the latter; also the means obstructing certain commercial advantages which is deeply interested. is not uncommon, treaties peace, the _uti possidetis_ take place. great britain, however, the present instance, stipulates restore all our posts territories her possession. she even adds an extent, not within our original claims, more than a compensation a small part ceded another quarter. she agrees re-admit a participation the fisheries. what equivalent do we give this? congress are recommend the restoration property those who have adhered her; expressly engage, no future injury shall be done them, person, liberty, property. this is the sole condition, our part, there is not an immediate reciprocity (the recovery debts, liberation prisoners, being mutual; the former, indeed, only declaring what the rights private faith, which all civilized nations hold sacred, would have declared without it), stands the single equivalent all the restitutions concessions be made great britain. will be honest violate this condition, will be prudent put competition all the important matters be performed the other side? will foreign nations be willing undertake any thing us, us, they find the nature our governments will allow no dependence be placed upon our engagements? have omitted saying any thing the impolicy inducing, our severity, a great number useful citizens, whose situations do not make them a proper object resentment, abandon the country, form settlements will hereafter become our rivals, animated a hatred us, which will descend their posterity. nothing, however, can be more unwise than contribute, we are doing, people the shores wilderness nova scotia; a colony which, its position, will become a competitor us, among other things, branch commerce which our navigation navy will essentially depend: mean the fisheries; which, have no doubt, the state new-york will, hereafter, have a considerable share. your excellency freely deliver my sentiments, because am persuaded cannot be a stranger the force these considerations. fear not even hazard them the justice good sense those whom have the honor represent. esteem my duty do it, because the question is important the interests the state, its relation the united states. those who consult only their passions, might choose construe what say, too favorable a set men who have been the enemies the public liberty: those whose esteem am most concerned, will acquit any personal considerations; will perceive only urge the cause national honor, safety, advantage. we have assumed an independent station: we ought feel, act, a manner consistent the dignity station. anxiously wish see every prudent measure taken prevent those combinations which will certainly disgrace us, they do not involve other calamities. whatever distinctions are judged necessary be made, the cases those persons who have been opposition the common cause, let them be made legal authority, a fair construction the treaty, consistent national faith national honor. your excellency will have been informed, congress have instructed general washington garrison the frontier posts, surrendered, the three years’ continental troops. this is more the interest the state, than have them garrisoned its particular expense: should wish permanent provision might be made the same principle. wait see whether any continental peace establishment garrisons, etc., will take place, before engage the consent congress a separate provision. cannot forbear adding a word the subject money. the only reliance we now have redeeming a large anticipation the public credit, already made, making, the benefit the army, is the taxes coming in. the collection, hitherto, is out all proportion the demand. is vast consequence, this juncture, every thing possible should be done forward it. forbear entering into details which would be very striking upon this subject. will only say, unless there is a serious exertion the states, public credit must ere long receive another shock very disagreeable its consequences. have the honor be, perfect respect, your excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency governor clinton. hamilton reed. 1783. sir: having always entertained an esteem personally, could not, without reluctance, yield impressions might weaken sentiment: is pain find myself drawn, circumstances, animadvert upon the late message the executive council the assembly pennsylvania relative the mutiny, a manner which may seem impeach the candor those who the authors it. will be impossible persons who have read the report the committee, the message the council, however inclined make allowances the force involuntary bias, not conclude, one side the other, the facts have been wilfully discolored. decline any attempt set the public opinion right upon this subject; because, after all can be said, the judgments men will eventually be determined personal party prepossessions. so far am concerned, persuade myself those who are acquainted me, will place entire confidence my fairness veracity. doubt not your excellency’s friends will be equally partial you, those the council them. though should despair rectifying fixing the public opinion, an appeal the public; though have seen too much the ridicule thrown upon such appeals, men official stations, the ill effect they have had upon the national character, not be willing sacrifice the desire justifying myself considerations prudence propriety; yet cannot forbear indulging my feelings so far enter into a few explanations your excellency; submitting the justness them the testimony your own mind. this is a mere private discussion, address myself your excellency particular; the rather, as, the style manner the message, take granted had the principal agency it: shall consider, the same grounds, the notes [20] paper the [20], a comment the report the committee yourself; aid the message. take up the matter individually, because mean treat a private footing; because, though do not acknowledge any peculiar responsibility, happened be my lot, chairman, principally conduct the conferences the part the committee. regard the whole this business a most unfortunate one; which, probably, none the actors will acquire great credit. deplore it, tending interrupt the harmony between congress a respectable, a meritorious member the union. who right, who wrong, is a question less importance, than mutual irritations may be best healed. whatever revives, continues, the former, is be regretted. lament be under an inducement discuss circumstances relate the remotest degree. nothing an attack upon the ingenuousness my conduct, could have called it. its prudence, either collectively individually, would patiently have been consigned the lash censure criticism, merited unmerited. happily, the present case, the members the committee have a strong ground, which they cannot easily be forced. apprehensive misconception, will not say misrepresentation, they tried render impossible written documents. the presumption, impartial minds, cannot fail be favor side which gave so decisive a proof its disposition fairness, endeavor put out its own power misrepresent. the professed scruples the council, cannot be admitted have any weight. usage, the plainest rules propriety, will dictate, never could have wounded the dignity, delicacy, the executive any state, have given a committee congress, appointed confer a subject moment, a written answer a request writing after previous explanations. the fact stated speaks itself. the consequences show, the precaution the committee was well judged; would have been well the council have concurred. the present case might be observed, there was, the first instance, a written application congress the council, the customary form resolutions: though a committee was authorized confer explain, a formal authentic answer might reasonably have been expected congress; and, desired the committee, should have been understood desired their behalf. there is an awkwardness reasoning upon self-evident positions; the council have, their conduct the first instance, their message since, put forward a doubt upon the subject, made a point importance, shall be excused examining a little further. what could the objection the council be founded? they say had been unusual. admitting the fact, was the mere novelty the thing a sufficient reason against it? there was no apparent inconvenience making a new precedent; if; the contrary, there was a manifest convenience it; ought not such a punctilio have given way considerations utility? was derogatory the dignity the council? surely, they communicate writing the executive servants congress, even those subordinate stations, is the practice every day, is indispensable the prosecution public business, they might, less expense dignity, pursue the same mode a part body itself. the distinction taken the council, their message the assembly, respecting the responsibility such executive officers, not applicable a committee, amounts any thing, proves only this: such officers ought, prudence, take greater precautions their own justification than a committee congress need do. is not be inferred, a committee congress, acting ministerially, think expedient use circumspection, those whom they are transacting business, can, propriety, refuse join them mode which is best adapted precision certainty. but, indeed, the ground distinction is erroneous. a committee congress act a ministerial capacity, are therefore responsible the body which they belong, well the servants body, though a different manner. be said they do not act ministerially, stand the place congress; then the council, upon their own principles, ought have complied their request. diminish the exceptionableness their refusal, is true, stated the council, though they said they could not _condescend_ do what the committee had asked; yet they declared themselves willing _grant_ an answer writing, congress should request it; they proposed, the committee should put their verbal answer writing, be afterwards perused examined them. the answer the committee, doubt not your excellency will recollect, was, the first point, congress all probability would not make the request, having determined (as the council had been already informed) not resume their deliberations the city, till effectual measures had been taken suppress the mutiny; should they assemble, would naturally feel a delicacy requesting what had been denied their committee. the second point, the council having judged inexpedient give a written answer, the committee would content themselves making the most accurate report their power, relying upon the confidence the body which they belonged, upon the candor the council. your excellency is too good a judge human nature, well the force language, not have perceived the time, the effect which the refusal the council had upon my mind. own struck me, either an uncandid reserve, an unbecoming stateliness; and, either supposition, a disrespect the body which the committee members. though nothing enters less into my temper than an inclination fetter business punctilio, after the council had discovered such overweening nicety, should have thought it a degradation my official character, have consented their proposal. the desire self-justification is so natural, should not have been surprised have seen the transactions which are the subject the council’s message, receive a coloring favorable their purpose: did not expect find material facts either suppressed denied. the report made the committee the first interview the council, was, acknowledge, memory, therefore admit a possibility error; but, so far my memory can be relied on, the representation was just. am certain there is a mistake the insinuation, the circumstance the message sent congress the board sergeants, was not mentioned all the council; have a note it, taken immediately after the first conference subsequent the mutiny. the affair, the event , having assumed a more serious aspect, kept a regular minute the proceedings; a summary which, made up our report congress, which shall annex, large, this letter your excellency’s perusal. the message entirely omits the declaration the council, ... ... ... [21]; the note says, the council only declared, “that they could not be sure, such another insult would produce those exertions.”[22] the difference this article is great importance. the declaration made so deep an impression the time, almost the precise words remained my memory. they twice repeated, well we saw your excellency alone, your own house, the morning, delivered us, the council chamber, the determination the council. mr. ellsworth[23], half an hour afterwards, repeated them several members congress assembled the president’s house; a few hours time committed them writing. cannot suppose your excellency’s recollection fails this particular; must pointedly appeal your candor. show the inaccuracy which the report the committee was composed, it is observed, the notes respect part which relates the commission given the mutineers the officers whom they had chosen represent them, only two hours had intervened between event the conference the council; it was very improbable the knowledge it could have so early reached the committee. it is added, none the council remembers have heard a single syllable respecting it, during the whole conference. the argument drawn the short interval between the delivery the commission the conference, it will be sufficient say, the committee held a constant communication general st. clair, he kept a vigilant eye upon all the motions the mutineers; his access them was easy; the fact question was a matter immediate notoriety; two hours abundant time a thing nature be conveyed the barracks general st. clair’s quarters; one the committee had actually seen, obtained the intelligence him, a little time before the interview the council commenced. it is much more extraordinary the council should have been apprised it so late, than the committee should have known it so early. the memory the council, it is unfortunate it should have been so fallible it is said have been: would rather suppose, “in the quick succession circumstances,” the matter had escaped recollection, than my minutes, well my memory, should have deceived me. well recollect, also, your excellency, it was mentioned, acknowledged it rather contradicted the pacific appearance which the conduct the troops, other respects, wore. these are the essential differences, point fact, between the report the committee, the message council: the whole complexion, indeed, one, materially varies the other; the most common observer must have noticed, different an aspect the same facts will bear, differently dressed arranged. it was avoid this, we proposed reduce them writing: this has not been done, spectators must judge, the situation the parties, the course the transactions, which side has given the justest relation. cannot, however, forbear remarking, see expressions civility, the part the committee, making a figure the message, very different their genuine intention; being introduced a manner gives them the air concessions favor the conduct the council. your excellency will certainly recollect, the committee very remote a concurrence sentiment the council; though they did not presume judge the disposition the citizens, strongly urged the expedience necessity calling out the militia, facility employing them success against an unofficered disorderly body mutinous soldiers. it is true, also, they acknowledged the candor which the council exposed them, what they deemed the temper their citizens, their own difficulties embarrassments; which were, no doubt, delineated great energy language, display circumstances: they certainly never admitted the candor refusing an answer writing, which was a part the _business_ transacted the council; nor did they _withdraw_, without giving an intelligible intimation their sense this proceeding. was also surprised see any part the private confidential conversation had your excellency, ushered into the message the council; moulded into such a shape, imply, an obvious construction, an approbation their reasons. your excellency will admit the following state this transaction be a just one. waited upon the council correct a piece information had given them respecting ammunition: even this is misstated, will be seen my minutes. having done this, my official business ended; was taken aside your excellency, a conversation passed declared confidence. informed me, a meeting the militia officers was then holding, consultation the council about eventual measures (in consequence, conjectured, a communication you, the preceding evening, the delegates the state, the intention congress remove the city, case they did not receive satisfactory assurances support). added, hoped nothing would be precipitated; proper allowances would be made the situation the council. understood your observations reference the departure congress, replied this effect: viewed the departure congress a delicate measure, including consequences important the national character abroad, critical respect the state pennsylvania, and, particular, the city philadelphia; the triumph a handful mutinous soldiers, permitted a place which is considered the capital america, surround, and, fact, imprison congress, without the least effort, the part the citizens, uphold their dignity authority, so oblige them remove the place which had been their residence during the revolution, would, it was be feared, be viewed a distance, a general disaffection the citizens the federal government; might discredit its negotiations, affect the national interests: that, home, it might give a deep wound the reputation pennsylvania; might draw upon it the resentments the other states, sow discord between congress the state; the removal congress would probably bring the affair a crisis; and, convincing the mutineers extremities intended, would either intimidate them into a submission, determine them immediate excesses; that, impressed these considerations, still hoping, notwithstanding some appearances the contrary, the mutineers might be sincere their professions submission, the council, further examination, would find it their power act vigor, had declined giving my assent a report writing, which would necessarily be followed the departure congress; though the committee had no discretion, the powers under which they acted, bound the tenor their instructions, the moment they did not receive “satisfactory assurances prompt adequate exertions, the part the state, supporting the public authority,” advise the adjournment congress trenton princeton; therefore considered the delay this advice their extreme peril; yet, myself, should persist it, till the result the present consultation the militia officers, till some new circumstance should turn up, explain the designs the mutineers; pursuing this line conduct, should counteract the sense some gentlemen, whose feelings upon the occasion keen, the opinions others, who thought the situation congress, under the existing circumstances, extremely awkward, precarious, unjustifiable their constituents. your excellency approved my intention; wished time; promised, any new resolution should be taken, give immediate notice it. the meeting the militia officers dissolved. heard nothing your excellency. general st. clair, about two the afternoon, informed the committee, the officers appointed the soldiers manage their business, had, the first instance, refused give him an account their transactions; the which was only extracted them a peremptory demand. he mentioned the instructions they had received the soldiers, which contained faint affected concessions, mixed new inadmissible claims. the whole affair wore the complexion collusion between the officers the committee the soldiery; a mere amusement their part, till they could gain fresh strength execute their project, whatever it might be, greater advantage. this behavior the officers gave the affair a new more serious aspect, overcame my opposition the report. mr. peters, hearing the relation general st. clair, declared, once, he thought the committee had then no alternative; least, what he said was understood this sense general st. clair, mr. ellsworth, myself. am not much mistaken, general st. clair also expressed his opinion congress unsafe the city. the ideas suggested your excellency, the conversation have mentioned, substantially expressed several members congress the motives my delay; particularly, recollect, mr. madison, these observations addition: though was fully convinced congress, under an immediate view circumstances, would, reality, be justified withdrawing a place such an outrage government had been impunity perpetrated, a body armed mutineers, still, several days, complete command the city, either the feebleness public councils, the indisposition the citizens, afforded no assurance protection support; yet, the opinions men would be governed events, the most probable event was, the removal congress, announcing decisive measures coercion the soldiery, would awe them into submission, there was great danger the reputation congress would suffer the easy termination the business; they would be accused levity, timidity, rashness. though not within the scope my original intention, will indulge a few additional reflections this subject. am sensible the council, some respects, stand upon advantageous ground this discussion. congress left the city, because they had no forces hand, no jurisdiction over the militia, no assurances effectual support those who had. the council, the executive the state, necessitated remain the spot. soon after congress removed, the mutineers deserted their leaders, surrendered discretion. the multitude will be very apt conclude, the affair was trifling consequence; it vanished under its own insignificance; congress took up the matter too high a tone authority; they discovered a prudish nicety irritability about their own dignity: council more temperate, more humane, possessed greater foresight. the bias favor an injured army; the propensity the human mind lean the speciousness professed humanity, rather than the necessary harshness authority; the vague imperfect notions what is due public authority, an infant popular government; the insinuating plausibility a well-constructed _message_; will all contribute conclusion. let suppose an impartial man sense, well acquainted facts, form an argument upon the subject. it appears me, he might naturally fall into this train combination. it is a well known fact, that, the necessities the war, the delinquencies the several states, congress not enabled comply their engagements the army, which, after a glorious successful struggle their country, much suffering, exemplary patience, signal desert, they compelled, the irresistible dictates an empty treasury a ruined credit, disband, after having given strong indications their discontent, resentment the public neglect. a large part the army suffer themselves be patiently dismissed; a particular corps four five hundred men, stationed the place congress reside, refuse accept their discharges certain specified conditions. they even go further, and, stimulated their injuries, encouraged misled designing persons, are emboldened send a threatening message congress, declaring them, unless they would do them justice immediately, they would find means redress themselves. measures are indirectly taken appease this disorder, give the discontented soldiers much satisfaction the situation things will permit. shortly after, accounts are received, another corps, miles distance, have also mutinied; a part them, the number about eighty men, are their march join those who had already discovered so refractory a disposition. a committee congress is immediately appointed confer the executive the state, the measures proper be pursued this exigency. committee, the first instance, suggest the council, the expedience calling out a body militia, intercept the detachment mutineers its march, represent the danger the progress the spirit mutiny, future outrages, should those their march be suffered, without molestation, join a more numerous corps the same temper themselves. the council urge a variety difficulties: the shortness the time collect the militia before the mutineers would arrive; the reluctance which the citizens would obey a call against men whom they consider meritorious, injured, the like. the committee, perceiving the unwillingness the council employ the militia, desist pressing, recur expedients. the day after, the mutineers march triumph into the city, unite themselves those who are already there; the following day, the whole body assemble arms, throw off all obedience their officers, and, open defiance government, march the place which is the usual seat congress the council the state, while both are actually sitting; surround it guards, send a message the council, demanding authority appoint, themselves, officers command them, absolute discretion take such measures those officers should think proper, redress their grievances; accompanied a threat, there was not a compliance twenty minutes, they would let an injured soldiery upon them, abide the consequence. the members congress who the time assembled, request general st. clair, who happened be present, take such measures he should judge expedient, without committing the honor government, divert the storm, induce the troops return their quarters without perpetrating acts violence. general st. clair, concert the council, grants the mutineers permission elect, out officers then, formerly, commission, such they should confide in, represent their grievances the council, a promise, the council would confer the persons elected purpose. having obtained this promise, the mutineers return their quarters, military parade, continue open defiance government. the concession made was a happy compromise between an attention dignity, a prudent regard safety. men who had dared carry their insolence such an extreme, who saw no opposition their outrages, not be expected retreat without an appearance, least, gratifying their demands. the slightest accident was sufficient prompt men, such a temper situation, tragical excesses. however it might become the delicacy government not depart the promise it had given, it was its duty provide effectually against a repetition such outrages; put itself a situation give, instead receiving, the law; manifest its compliance was not the effect necessity, choice. this was not be considered the disorderly riot an unarmed mob, the deliberate mutiny an incensed soldiery, carried the utmost point outrage short assassination. the licentiousness an army is be dreaded every government; but, a republic, it is more particularly be restrained; directed against the civil authority, be checked energy, punished severity. the merits sufferings the troops might be a proper motive mitigating punishment, it was the power the government inflict it; it was no reason relaxing the measures necessary put itself situation. its authority was first be vindicated, then its clemency be displayed. the rights government are essential be defended, the rights individuals. the security the one is inseparable the other. and, indeed, every new government, especially the popular kind, the great danger is, public authority will not be sufficiently respected. upon this occasion, there more particular reasons decision. congress knew there were, within two three days’ march the city, a more considerable body the same corps, part which had mutinied come town, had been the chief actors the late disorder; those men had, difficulty, been kept, the exertions their officers, joining the insurgents the first instance; there was another corps their neighborhood which, a little time before, had also discovered symptoms mutiny; a considerable part the same line which mutiny town, was every moment expected arrive the southward, and, there was the greatest reason conclude, would be infected the same spirit, their arrival, had presently happened the case a small detachment which had joined a few days before; there were, besides, large numbers disbanded soldiers, scattered through the country, want, who had not yet had time settle down any occupation, exchange their military private habits; some these really coming in, adding themselves the revolters; an extensive accession strength might be gained these different quarters; there all the sympathies like common wrongs, distresses, resentments, bring them together, unite them one cause. the partial success those who had already made an experiment, would be a strong encouragement others; the rather, the whole line had formerly mutinied, not only impunity, advantage themselves. this state things, decision was most compatible the safety the community, well the dignity government. though no general convulsion might be be apprehended, serious mischiefs might attend the progress the disorder. indeed, it would have been meanness, have negotiated temporized an armed banditti four five hundred men; who, any other situation than surrounding a defenceless senate, could only become formidable being feared. this was not an insurrection a whole people: it was not an army their officers their head, demanding the justice their country; either which might have made caution concession respectable: it was a handful mutinous soldiers, who had equally violated the laws discipline, the rights public authority. congress, therefore, wisely resolve, “it is necessary effectual measures be immediately taken supporting the public authority;” call upon the state which they reside, the assistance its militia, the same time they send orders the march a body regular forces an eventual resource. there was a propriety calling the aid the militia the first place, different reasons. civil government may always, more peculiar propriety, resort the aid the citizens, repel military insults encroachments. ’tis there, it ought be supposed, it may seek its surest dependence, especially a democracy, which is the creature the people. the citizens each state are, an aggregate light, the citizens the united states, bound, much support the representatives the whole, their own immediate representatives. the insult was not congress personally; it was the government, public authority general; was very properly put upon footing. the regular forces, which congress could command, were a great distance, could not, a length time, be brought effectuate their purpose. the disorder continued exist the spot they were; was likely increase delay; might be productive sudden mischievous effects being neglected. the city the bank were immediate danger being rifled; and, perhaps, suffering other calamities. the citizens, therefore, were the proper persons make the first exertion. the objection, these were not the objects the care congress, can only serve mislead the vulgar. the peace safety the place which was the immediate residence congress, _endangered, too, the troops the united states_, demanded their interposition. the president the state pennsylvania was himself this opinion; having declared a member body, their troops were the offenders, it was proper them declare the necessity calling out the militia, a previous step its being done. nor is there more weight the supposition the danger was inconsiderable; that, the pacific appearances the troops, it was be expected, the disorder would subside itself. the facts were, the troops still continued a state mutiny; had made no submissions, nor offered any; they affected negotiate their arms their hands. a band mutinous soldiers, such a situation, uncontrolled, elated their own power, was not be trusted. the most sudden vicissitudes contradictory changes were be expected; a fit intoxication was sufficient, any moment, men who had already gone such length, make the city a scene plunder massacre. it was the height rashness leave the city exposed the bare possibility such mischiefs. the only question, this view, is, whether there was greater danger the city, attempting their reduction force, than endeavoring, palliatives, bring them a sense duty? it has been urged, appeared have operated strongly upon the minds the council,[24] the soldiers being already embodied, accustomed arms, ready act a moment’s warning, it would be extremely hazardous attempt collect the citizens subdue them, the mutineers might have taken advantage the first confusion incident the measure, do a great deal mischief, before this militia could have assembled equal superior force. it is not be denied, a small body disciplined troops, headed led their officers, a plan conduct, could have effected a great deal similar circumstances; it is equally certain, nothing can be more contemptible, than a body men, used be commanded obey, deprived the example direction their officers. they are infinitely less be dreaded than an equal number men who have never been broken command, nor exchanged their natural courage artificial kind which is the effect discipline habit. soldiers transfer their confidence themselves their officers, face danger the force example, the dread punishment, the sense necessity. take away these inducements leave them themselves, they are no longer resolute than till they are opposed. the present case, it was be relied upon, the appearance opposition would instantly bring the mutineers a sense their insignificance, submission. conscious their weakness, the smallness their numbers; a populous city, the midst a populous country; awed the consequences resisting government arms, confounded the want proper leaders proper direction; the common soldiers would have thought nothing making their peace the sacrifice those who had been the authors their misconduct. the idea, therefore, coercion, was the safest most prudent: more was be apprehended leaving them their own passions, than attempting control them force. it will be seen, by, far the events, justly appreciated, corresponded this reasoning. congress were not only right adopting measures coercion; they were also right resolving change their situation, proper exertions were not made the particular government citizens the place they resided. the want such exertions would evince some defect, no matter where, would prove they ought have no confidence their situation. they were, all intents purposes, the power a lawless, armed banditti, enraged, whether justly, not, against them. however they might have had a right expose their own persons insult outrage, they had no right expose the character representatives, the dignity the states they represented, the union. it was plain, they could not, propriety, such a state things, proceed their deliberations they were; it was right they should repair a place they could do it. it was far impossible, the mutineers might have been induced seize their persons, hostages their own security, well a hope extorting concessions. had such an event taken place, the whole country would have exclaimed, why did not congress withdraw a place they found they could not be assured support; the government was so feeble, the citizens so indisposed, suffer three four hundred mutinous soldiers violate, impunity, the authority the united states, their own state? they resolved depart, the want adequate exertions, they had reason doubt their being made, the disinclination shown the council call out the militia the first instance: they did actually depart, they were informed the council, the efforts the citizens were not be looked for, even a repetition the outrage which had already happened; it was be doubted what measure outrage would produce them. they had also convincing proof, the mutiny was more serious than it had even first appeared, the participation some the officers. throw the blame harshness precipitancy upon congress, it is said, their dignity was only _accidentally_ _undesignedly_ offended. much stress has been laid upon the message, the soldiery being directed the council, not them. all this, however, is very immaterial the real merits the question. whatever might have been the first intention the mutineers this particular act, whether it proceeded artifice confusion ideas, the indignity congress was the same. they knew congress customarily held their deliberations the state house: it even be admitted, they knew saturday be a day usual recess, which, perhaps, is not altogether probable: they came the place they saw, knew, congress be assembled there. they did not desist consequence this; proceeded station their guards, execute their purposes. members congress went out them; remonstrated them; represented the danger their proceedings themselves, desired them withdraw: they persisted till they obtained what they supposed a part their object. a majority the same persons had, some days before, sent a message, almost equally exceptionable, congress; the time they scarcely spoke any other body than congress; who, indeed, may naturally be supposed have been the main object their resentments: congress, having always appeared the soldiery, be the body who contracted them, who had broken faith them, it is not be supposed they were capable investigating the remote causes the failures, so transfer the odium congress the state. the substantial thing be considered this question, is the violation public authority. it cannot be disputed, the mutiny troops is a violation authority which they owe obedience. this was, the present case, aggravated a high degree atrociousness, the gross insult the government pennsylvania, the face congress, defiance their displeasure. it was further aggravated continuing condition a series time. the reasons have been assigned, made it incumbent upon congress interpose; they called upon the state pennsylvania, not only vindicate its own rights, support their authority, the declining a compliance was a breach the confederation, the duty which the state pennsylvania owed the united states. the best apology the government pennsylvania, this case, is, they could not command the services their citizens. so improper a disposition the citizens, admitted, must operate an additional justification congress, their removal. the subsequent events, justly appreciated, illustrate the propriety their conduct. the mutineers did not make voluntary submissions consequence negotiation, persuasion, conviction. they did not submit till after congress had left the city, publishing their intentions coercion; till after there had been an _actual call_ upon the militia; till their leaders instigators, alarmed the approach force, the fear being betrayed the men, fled. they were reduced coercion, not overcome mildness. it appears, too, while they were professing repentance, a return their duty, they were tampering the troops yorktown lancaster, increase their strength; two officers, least, were concerned the mutiny, who, their letters since, have confessed, some project importance was contemplation. the call the militia was made the day after it had been pronounced ineligible the council. there could have been little change, time, either the temper preparations the citizens. the truth is, the departure congress brought the matter a crisis; the council were compelled, necessity, do what they ought have done before, through choice. it is be lamented they did not, an earlier decision, prevent the necessity congress taking a step which may have many disagreeable consequences. they then would [_the residue the manuscript is not found._] [20] these blanks are the manuscript.

substantially, the observations which follow. hamilton madison. princeton, june 29, 1783. dear sir: am informed, that, among other disagreeable things said about the removal congress philadelphia, it is insinuated, it was a contrivance some members, get them out the state pennsylvania, into one those which they belonged; am told, this insinuation has been pointed particular. though am persuaded, all disinterested persons will justify congress quitting a place they were told they were not expect support (for the conduct the council amounted that), yet, am unwilling be held up having had an extraordinary agency the measure interested purposes, the fact is directly the reverse. were a witness my conduct opinions through the whole the transaction, am induced trouble your testimony upon this occasion. do not mean make a public use it; but, through my friends, vindicate myself the imputations have mentioned. will therefore request your answers the following questions: did part the resolutions, which related the removal congress, originate me, not? did i, a member the committee, appear press the departure; did not rather manifest a strong disposition postpone event long possible, even against the general current opinion? wish be particular full your answer your memory will permit. think will recollect, my idea was clearly this: the mutiny ought not be terminated negotiation; congress were justifiable leaving a place they did not receive the support which they had a right expect; but, their removal was a measure a critical delicate nature; might have an ill appearance europe; might, events, be susceptible an unfavorable interpretation this country; it was prudent delay it till its necessity became apparent: not only till it was manifest there would be no change the spirit which seemed actuate the council; till it was evident, complete submission was not be expected the troops; that, give full time this, it would be proper delay the departure congress till the latest period which would be compatible the idea meeting trenton princeton thursday--perhaps even till thursday morning. am, sir, your most obedient servant, a. hamilton. james madison, junior, esq. hamilton james madison, jr. philadelphia, july 6, 1783. dear sir: my arrival this city am more convinced than was the necessity giving a just state facts the public. the current runs strongly against congress, a great measure want information. when facts are explained they make an impression, incline conclusions more favorable us. have no copy the reports my possession, which puts it out my power publish them. will procure send one without loss time? without appearing, intend give them the public some additional explanations. this done moderation will no doubt have a good effect. the prevailing idea is, the actors the removal congress were influenced the desire getting them out the city, the generality the remainder timidity--some say passion. few give a more favorable interpretation. will thank your letter answer the following question: what appeared be my ideas disposition respecting the removal congress? did appear wish hasten it, did not rather show a strong disposition procrastinate it? will be obliged answering this question do it fully. do not intend make any public use it, through my friends vindicate myself the insinuation have mentioned, confute the supposition the motive assigned did actuate the members whom it fell be more particularly active. yours, a. hamilton. hamilton mrs. hamilton. philadelphia, july 22, 1783. wrote you, my beloved eliza, the last post, which hope will not meet the fate many others my letters must have met with. count upon setting out see four days; have been so frequently disappointed unforeseen events, shall not be without apprehensions being detained, till have begun my journey. the members congress are very pressing not go away this time, the house is thin, the definitive treaty is momently expected. tell your father mr. rivington, a letter the south carolina delegates, has given information, coming him admiral arbuthnot, the mercury frigate is arrived new-york the definitive treaty, the city was be evacuated yesterday, the treaty. am strongly urged stay a few days the ratification the treaty; all events, however, will not be long absent. give joy the happy conclusion this important work which your country has been engaged. now, a very short time, hope we shall be happily settled new-york. my love your father. kiss my boy a thousand times. a. hamilton. hamilton governor clinton. princeton, july 27, 1783. sir: a few days since was honored your excellency’s letter the was glad find your ideas the subject corresponded mine. shall, a day two, take leave congress, think it my duty give my opinion the legislature, a matter importance the state, which has been long depending, is still without a prospect termination the train which it has been placed: mean the affair the grants. it is hazardous pass a positive judgment what will happen a body so mutable congress; all have seen, have come a settled opinion, no determination will be taken executed them any other manner, than prescribed the confederation. there is always such a diversity views interests; so many compromises be made between different states; that, a question this nature, the embarrassments which have been increased the steps have preceded, which the passions the opposite sides have taken a warm part, decision must be the result necessity. while congress have a discretion, they will procrastinate: when they are bound the constitution, they must proceed. it is, therefore, my opinion, it will be advisable the legislature, when they meet, review the question; either relinquish their pretensions the country dispute, instruct their delegates, a decision is not had within a limited time, declare the submission congress revoked, institute a claim according the principles the confederation. it would be out my province discuss which side the alternative ought, policy, prevail: will take the liberty observe, the last should be preferred, it would be expedient remove every motive opposition private claims; not only confirming, their full latitude, previous the trial, the possessions the original settlers, even the grants the usurped government. it may happen, it will be eventually necessary employ force; and, this case, it would be great importance neither the inhabitants the grants, nor powerful individuals other states, should find their private interest contradiction the state. this has already had great influence counteracting our wishes; would continue throw impediments the way ulterior measures; might last kindle a serious flame between the states. communicated your excellency, a former letter, had declined pressing the application the legislature congress, respecting the state troops garrisoning the frontier posts, because temporary provision had been made another way, which would save the state the immediate expense; because there was a prospect some general provision the defence the frontiers a continental establishment, which was be preferred every account. a report this purpose is now before congress; the thinness representation has, some time, retarded, still retards, its consideration. the definitive treaty is not yet arrived; accounts which, though not official, appear deserve credit, it may be daily expected. a gentleman, known confided in, has arrived philadelphia, who informs, he saw a letter dr. franklin mr. barkeley, telling him the definitive treaties were signed the twenty-seventh may, between all the parties; new-york was be evacuated six months the ratification the preliminaries europe, which will be the twelfth fifteenth next month. it is not my intention return congress, take this opportunity make my respectful acknowledgments the legislature, the honorable mark their confidence conferred upon me, having chosen represent the state body. shall be happy my conduct has been agreeable them. perfect respect, have the honor be, your excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general

influenced congress against the declared sense the state; give directions the commander-in-chief garrisoning those posts continental troops. this is a duty which, not having been present the debates, we find ourselves incompetent. we can therefore, only refer his excellency the legislature you, our worthy colleagues, who, being fully possessed the facts, can alone give the necessary official information. sentiments the most perfect esteem regard, we have the honor be, gentlemen, your most obedient servants, jas. duane. ezra l’hommedieu. the honorable cols. william floyd alexander

because it added your happiness, because it tended fix your residence a state which long wished be remain a citizen. the character talents delegates congress daily become more more important, regret your declining appointment this interesting period. respect, however, is due the considerations which influence you, they do not oppose your accepting a place the legislature, hope the state will still continue draw advantage your services; much remains be done, laborers do not abound. am happy hear terms peace, the conduct your negotiators, give general satisfaction: there are some our countrymen, it seems, who are not content; that, too, an article which thought be very unexceptionable; viz., the one ascertaining our boundaries. perhaps those gentlemen are latitudinarians. the american newspapers, some months past, contain advices which do us harm. violences associations against the tories, pay an ill compliment government, impeach our good faith the opinion some, our magnanimity the opinion many. our reputation also suffers, the apparent reluctance taxes, the ease which we incur debts without providing their payment. the complaints the army; the jealousies respecting congress; the circumstances which induced their leaving philadelphia; the too little appearance a national spirit pervading, uniting, invigorating the confederacy, are considered omens which portend the diminution our respectability, power, felicity. hope that, the wheel turns round, other better indications will soon appear. am persuaded america possesses too much wisdom virtue, permit her brilliant prospects fade away want either. the tories are almost much pitied these countries they are execrated ours. an undue degree severity towards them, would, therefore, be impolitic, well unjustifiable. they who incline involve whole class men indiscriminate punishment ruin, certainly carry the matter too far. it would be an instance unnecessary rigor, unmanly revenge, without a parallel, except the annals religious rage times bigotry blindness. what it signify nine-tenths these people are buried? would rather see the sweat their brows fertilize our fields than those our neighbors. * * * * * victory peace should, my opinion, be followed clemency, moderation, benevolence: we should be careful not sully the glory the revolution, licentiousness cruelty. these are my sentiments: however unpopular they may be, have not the least desire conceal disguise them. believe be, great regard esteem, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, john jay. colonel a. hamilton. hamilton washington. albany, september 30, 1783. dear sir: flatter myself may indulge a consciousness my services have been some value the public, least enough merit the small compensation wish, will make no apology your excellency, conveying, through you, wish congress. are able inform them, they wish information, what degree may have been useful: have entire confidence will do justice. a letter which wrote several months ago, intimated it might be your power contribute the establishment our federal union upon a more solid basis. have never since explained myself. the time, was hopes congress might have been induced take a decisive ground; inform their constituents the imperfections the present system, the impossibility conducting the public affairs, honor themselves advantage the community, powers so disproportioned their responsibility; and, having done this, a full forcible manner, adjourn the moment the definitive treaty was ratified. retiring the same juncture, wished you, a solemn manner, declare the people, your intended retreat public concerns; your opinion the present government, the absolute necessity a change. before left congress despaired the first; your circular letter the states had anticipated the last. trust it will not be without effect; though am persuaded it would have had more, combined what have mentioned. all events, without compliment, sir, it will do honor the sensible well meaning; and, ultimately, it is be hoped, the people large, when the present epidemic frenzy has subsided. am, dear sir, sincere esteem, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. albany, september 30, 1783. sir: think may address the subject this letter your excellency more propriety than any other person, it is purely a military nature; are best acquainted my services an officer; are now engaged assisting form the arrangements the future peace establishment. your excellency knows, march, ’82, relinquished all claim any future compensation my services, either during the residue the war, after its conclusion--simply retaining my rank. this foundation build a hope, may be permitted preserve my rank, the peace establishment, without emoluments unattached any corps--as an honorary reward the time have devoted the public. may hereafter travel, may find it an agreeable circumstance appear the character have supported the revolution. rest my claim solely the sacrifice have made; because have no reason believe my services have appeared any value congress; they declined giving them any marks their notice, an occasion which appeared my friends entitle it, well the common practice sovereigns, the particular practice this country repeated instances. your excellency will recollect, it was my lot york town command, senior officer, a successful attack upon one the enemy’s redoubts; the officer who acted a similar capacity another attack, made the same time the french troops, has been handsomely distinguished, consequence it, the government which he belongs; there are several examples among us, congress have bestowed honors upon actions, perhaps not more useful nor, apparently, more hazardous. these observations are inapplicable the present congress, further than they may possibly furnish an additional motive a compliance my wish. the only thing ask your excellency, is, my application may come into view the course the consultations the peace establishment. have the honor be, sincere esteem, your excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. hamilton governor clinton. albany, october 3, 1783. sir: have lately received messrs. duane l’hommedieu, an extract a letter your excellency the delegates, the twenty-third august last, requesting “a particular detail the motives which influenced the determination congress,” respecting the application the legislature have their state troops released continental pay, the purpose garrisoning the frontier posts. my letters your excellency, the first june twenty-seventh july, which were intended be official, summarily informed you, congress had made temporary provision garrisoning the frontier posts, a plan was under deliberation relative a peace establishment, which would, course, embrace object permanently; such temporary provision being made the common expense, a general plan being under consideration the future, had declined pressing a compliance the application the legislature; conceiving it be more the interest the state, the expense should be jointly borne, than it should fall exclusively upon itself. did not enter into a more full detail upon the subject, because the business continued, the time left congress, an undecided state; it was impossible judge what views would finally prevail. the concurrent resolutions the two houses had been immediately, their receipt, referred a committee appointed report a peace establishment, who had suspended their report these resolutions, till it should appear, what would be the fate a general plan which had been submitted. the motives influenced congress making the provision they did make, rather than immediately assenting the application the state; far was able collect them, they were these: the opinions many were unsettled the most eligible mode providing the security the frontiers, consistent the constitution, well respect the general policy the union, considerations justice those states whose frontiers were more immediately exposed. a considerable part the house appeared think, reasons a very cogent nature, the well-being the union required a federal provision the security the different parts; it would be a great hardship individual states, peculiarly circumstanced, throw the whole burthen expense upon them, recurring separate provisions, a matter, the benefit which would be immediately shared their neighbors, and, ultimately, the union large: that, indeed, it was not probable particular states would be either able, or, _upon experiment_, willing, make competent provision their separate expense; the principle might eventually excite jealousies between the states unfriendly the common tranquillity. freely confess was one who held this opinion. questions naturally arose the true construction the articles confederation upon this head; questions delicate interesting, difficult solution. one hand, it was doubted whether congress were authorized the confederation, proceed upon the idea a federal provision: the other, it was perceived such a contrary construction would be dangerous the union, including, among other inconveniences, this consequence: the united states, congress, cannot raise a single regiment, nor equip a single ship, the general defence, till after a declaration war, an actual commencement hostilities. this dilemma, an important constitutional question; other urgent matters depending before congress; the advanced season requiring a determination upon the mode securing the western posts case a surrender this fall; all sides the house concurred making a temporary provision, the manner which has been communicated. my apprehension the views the legislature was simply this: that, looking forward a surrender the posts, conceiving, some expressions the articles confederation, separate provision was be made the frontier garrisons; they had thought it expedient apply the troops already foot purpose, propose congress give their sanction it. under this apprehension; reflecting, besides, those troops were engaged only a short period, upon a very improper establishment continue, account the enormous pay the private men; the expense which is now shared all, which would have fallen solely upon the state, had the application been complied with; would probably be the rate nearly eighty thousand dollars per annum, a considerable sum the state its present situation; acknowledge your excellency, saw pleasure, rather than regret, the turn which the affair took. shall be sorry, however, it has contravened the intentions the legislature. will take the liberty add, upon this occasion, it has always appeared great importance, this state particular, well the union general, federal, rather than state, provision should be made the defence every part the confederacy, peace well war. without entering into arguments general policy, it will be sufficient observe, this state is, all respects _critically situated_. its relative position, shape, intersections, viewed the map, strongly speak this language.--strengthen the confederation; give it exclusively the power the sword: let each state have no forces its militia. a question mere economy, the following considerations deserve great weight. the north river facilitates attacks sea land: and, besides the frontier forts, all military men are opinion, a strong post should be maintained west point, some other position the lower part the river. canada is well governed, it may become well peopled, inhabitants attached its government. the british nation, while it preserves the idea retaining possession country, may be expected keep foot there, a large force. the position force, either defence offence, will necessarily be such will afford a prompt easy access us. our precautions defence, must be proportioned their means annoying us: we may hereafter find it indispensable increase our frontier garrisons. the present charge a competent force quarter, thrown additionally, into the scale those contributions which we must make the payment the public debt, other objects general expense, if the union lasts, would, fear, enlarge our burthen beyond our ability: charge, hereafter increased, it may be, would be oppressively felt the people. it includes, not only the expense paying subsisting the necessary number troops, keeping the fortifications repair; probably creating others; furnishing the requisite supplies military stores. say nothing the indian nations, because, though it will be always prudent be upon our guard against them, yet, am opinion we diminish the necessity it making them our friends: take it granted, there cannot be a serious doubt, any where, the obvious policy endeavoring do it. their friendship, alone, can keep our frontiers peace. it is essential the improvement the fur trade; an object immense importance the state. the attempt the total expulsion so desultory a people, is chimerical it would be pernicious. war them is expensive it is destructive: it has not a single object; for, the acquisitions their lands is not be wished, till those now vacant are settled: the surest, well the most just humane way removing them, is extending our settlements their neighborhood. indeed, it is not impossible they may be already willing exchange their former possessions others more remote. the foregoing considerations would lose all force, if we had full security the rest the world would make our safety prosperity the first object their reverence care: an expectation this kind would be too much against the ordinary course human affairs; too visionary be a rule national conduct. it is true, our situation secures us conquest, if internal dissensions do not open the way: when nations now make war upon each other, the object seldom is total conquest. partial acquisitions; the jealousy power; the rivalship dominion, commerce; sometimes national emulation antipathy; are the motives. nothing shelters us the operation either these causes. the fisheries; the fur trade; the navigation the lakes the mississippi; the western territory; the islands the west indies, reference traffic; short, the passions human nature, are abundant sources contention hostility. will not trespass further your excellency’s patience. expected, indeed, my last letter would have finished my official communications; messrs. duane l’hommedieu having transmitted the extract your letter mr. floyd myself, order we might comply what your excellency thought would be expected the legislature, it became my duty give this explanation. mr. floyd having been congress a little time after the concurrent resolutions arrived, being now a great distance me, occasions a separate communication. have the honor be, perfect respect, your excellency’s most obedient servant, a. hamilton. n. b. did not the time inclose the resolution, directing the general provide garrisoning the frontier posts, because understood it would course be transmitted the president, the secretary war. a. h. his excellency governor clinton. madison hamilton. princeton, october 16, 1783. dear sir: your favor the sixth july, some singular ill luck, never found its way my hands till yesterday evening. the only part now needs attention, is a request would answer the following question: “what appeared be my ideas disposition respecting the removal congress: did appear wish hasten it, did not rather show a strong disposition procrastinate it?” if this request had been received the time it ought, it might have been answered fully then wished. even after the delay which has taken place, my recollection enables me, certainty, witness, the uniform strain your sentiments, they appeared, both particular conversations myself, incidental ones others my presence, was opposed the removal congress, except the last necessity; when finally yielded the measure, it appeared be more compliance the peremptory expostulations others than any disposition your own mind; after the arrival congress princeton, your conversation showed reviewed the removal, rather regret than pleasure. perhaps this obedience your wishes may be too late answer the original object them. could not omit such an opportunity testifying the esteem regard which am your obedient servant, j. madison, jr. the hon. alexander hamilton, esq. washington hamilton. rocky hill, october 18, 1783. dear sir: am favored your two letters the thirtieth september. the debate indian affairs, which, believe, is got through, the residence congress, which is yet agitation, have entirely thrown aside, some time, the consideration the peace establishment. when it is resumed, will take care your application comes into view; shall be happy if any thing my power may contribute its success; being, great truth, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. colonel hamilton. mchenry hamilton. princeton, october 22, 1783. dear hamilton: the homilies you delivered congress are still recollected pleasure. the impressions they made are favor your integrity; no one believes you a man honor republican principles. were you ten years older twenty thousand pounds richer, there is no doubt you might obtain the suffrages congress the highest office their gift. you are supposed possess various knowledge, useful, substantial, ornamental. your very grave your cautious, your men who measure others the standard their own creeping politics, think you sometimes intemperate, seldom visionary: were you pursue your object much cold perseverance you do ardor argument, you would become irresistible. a word, if you could submit spend a whole life dissecting a fly, you would be, their opinion, one the greatest men the world. bold designs; measures calculated their rapid execution; a wisdom would convince its own weight; a project would surprise the people into greater happiness, without giving them an opportunity view it reject it; are not adapted a council composed discordant elements, a people who have thirteen heads, each which pay superstitious adorations inferior divinities. have been deterred, day day, sending you the extract you desire, a proclamation the subject, which expected would have passed. it is still _in dubio_. have reported fleury’s case, the principle you recommend. fear his half-pay will not be granted. congress, some time ago, determined fix their federal town the delaware, near trenton. yesterday they determined erect a second federal town the potomac, near georgetown; reside equal periods (not exceeding one year) annapolis trenton, till the buildings are completed. we adjourn the twelfth next month, meet annapolis the twenty-sixth. adieu, my dear friend; the days your happiness drop a line yours. james mchenry. p.s. our exemplification the treaty has passed, will be transmitted the state officially. j. mch. the hon. alexander hamilton, esq. washington hamilton. rocky hill, november 6, 1783. dear sir: the inclosed is a letter which had written, was about dispatch the date it; but, upon second thoughts, determined postpone it, try, if, the importance the matter, could not bring forward the peace establishment previously. have tried vain. congress, after resolving, the ---- last month, adjourn upon the twelfth this, did, equally unexpectedly surprisingly me, finish their session this place the day before yesterday; without bringing the peace establishment, any the many other pressing matters, a decision. finding this was likely be the case, showed your letter some your particular friends; consulted them the propriety making known your wishes my testimonial your services congress; they advised decline it, under a full persuasion no discrimination would, indeed, could, be made this late hour, every other officer, the highest the lowest grades (not actual command), were retiring without the retention rank; that the remainder, upon a peace establishment (if a continental one should ever take place), would come upon the new system, under fresh appointments; so that unless you wished come into actual command again (which none supposed), they saw no way which you could preserve your rank. have the pleasure inclose you a brevet, giving you the rank full colonel. am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. colonel hamilton. hamilton president congress. new-york, december 8, 1783. sir: being concerned counsel a number persons who have been, since the annunciation the provisional treaty, indicted under the confiscation laws this state, the part they are supposed have taken the late war, we are induced, the desire our clients, their behalf, apply congress, through your excellency, an exemplification the definitive treaty. we take it granted, that ere this it will have been direction the united states. we have found a great strictness the courts this state. it will, we apprehend, be necessary be able produce an exemplification the treaty under the seal the united states. a matter so interesting a great number individuals, it not belong us urge considerations national honor, we hope we shall be excused when we observe, that there appears be no probability that the legislature this state will interpose its authority put a stop prosecutions, till the definitive treaty is announced form. the mean time, a period is limited the appearance the indicted persons plead their indictments, if they neglect appear, judgment default will be entered against them. it is therefore great consequence them, that we should have our possession, speedily possible, an authentic document the treaty, its ratification congress; we, this account, pray an exemplification both. we persuade ourselves that the justice liberality congress will induce a ready compliance our prayer, which will conduce the security a great number individuals who derive their hopes safety the national faith. we have the honor be perfect respect, your excellency’s most obedient humble servants, a. hamilton others. his excellency the president congress. hamilton j. b. church. new-york, march 10, 1784. my dear sir: my last you informed you that a project a land bank had been set foot mr. sayre, the ostensible parent; that had reason suspect the chancellor was the true father. the fact has turned out supposed, the chancellor, a number others, have since petitioned the legislature an exclusive charter the proposed bank. thought it necessary, not only a view your project, the sake the commercial interests the state, start an opposition this scheme; took occasion point out its absurdity inconvenience some the most intelligent merchants, who presently saw the matter a proper light, began take measures defeat the plan. the chancellor had taken so much pains the country members, that they all began be persuaded that the land bank was the true philosopher’s stone that was turn all their rocks trees into gold; there was great reason apprehend a majority the legislature would have adopted his views. it became necessary convince the projectors themselves the impracticability their scheme; counteract the impressions they had made a direct application the legislature. some the merchants, effect these purposes, set foot a subscription a money bank, called upon subscribe. was a little embarrassed act, upon the whole concluded it best fall them, endeavor induce them put the business upon such a footing might enable you, advantage, combine your interests theirs; since the thing had been taken up upon the broad footing the whole body the merchants, it appeared that it never would be your interest pursue a distinct project opposition theirs; that you would prefer, so far you might choose employ money this way, become purchasers the general bank. the object, this supposition, was have the bank founded such principles would give you a proper weight the direction. unluckily, this purpose, entered rather late into the measure: proposals had been agreed upon, which, among other things, it was settled that no stockholder, whatever amount, should have more than seven votes, which was the number which a holder ten shares was be entitled. an after meeting some the most influential characters, engaged them so far depart this ground, allow a vote every five shares above ten. the stockholders have since thought proper appoint one the directors. shall hold it till wadsworth you come out, and, if you choose become parties this bank, shall make a vacancy one you. inclose you the constitution, the names the president, directors, cashier. an application a charter has been made the legislature, a petition against granting an exclusive one the land bank. the measures which have been taken appear have had their effect upon the minds the partisans the land bank. the affairs the bank pennsylvania appear be some confusion. they have stopped discounts; have no apprehension that there is any thing more the matter than temporary embarrassment having a little overshot their mark their issues paper, the opposition which the attempt establish a new bank had produced. affectionately, a. hamilton. j. b. church, esq. hamilton fitzsimmons. new-york, march 21, 1784. dear sir: permit introduce your acquaintance attention mr. seton, cashier the bank new-york. he is just setting out philadelphia procure materials information the forms business. recommend him you, because am persuaded you will pleasure facilitate his object. personally, dare say you will be pleased him. he will tell you our embarrassments prospects. hope an incorporation the two banks, which is evidently the interest both, has put an end differences philadelphia. here a wild impracticable scheme a land bank stands our way; the projectors it persevering spite the experience they have, that all the mercantile moneyed influence is against it. a. hamilton. william seton hamilton. philadelphia, 27 march, 1784. dear sir: you will observe my letter this day our president, that have been requested postpone my visit the bank until they shall be well informed that the bank new-york has, actually will, obtain a charter. although am confident this is only an ostensible reason not wishing see the bank, it will be highly necessary should be regularly informed what is doing this respect, that i may be able speak fully firmness the subject; therefore, exclusive any letter the director may write me, i trust you will communicate whatever may appear you essential me know. the fact is (and which cannot be communicated the many, therefore not mentioned my official letter), their motive not wishing see me the bank just now, arises their being present very great confusion--the opposition the new bank began it, being pressed so hard this opposition, they were obliged lay themselves so open, that it evidently appeared, if carried further, it would strike too fatal a blow. therefore, the safety the community large, it became absolutely necessary drop the idea a new bank, join hand hand relieve the old bank the shock it had received. gold silver had been extracted such amounts that discounting was stopped, this fortnight past not any business has been done the bank this way. the distress it has occasioned those dependent circulation engaged large speculations, is severe; and, if their cup misery must overflow, the last arrival europe, intelligence is received that no less a sum than £60,000 sterling mr. morris’s bills, drawn the dutch loan, are under protest. it is well known that the bank, some means other, must provide this sum. the child must not desert its parent distress, and, such is their connection, that whatever is fatal the one must be so the other. however, the man who has more than once, his consummate abilities, saved the american empire ruin, will no doubt be found equal overcome these temporary inconveniences, restore universal confidence good order. i trust you will be guarded your conversation others this subject, lest it might recoil me, not only place me a disagreeable situation, defeat the purposes my coming there. i have had several interviews our friend gov. morris; he is making the bank new-york a branch the bank north america, we differ widely our ideas the benefit that would result such a connection. if it will not be intruding too much upon your time goodness, may i request that you will now then inform me what is doing our legislature, permit me assure you, that it will ever give me singular pleasure have it my power evince the respect esteem which i am, dear sir, your ob’t very humble serv’t, wm. seton. alexander hamilton, esq. hamilton gouverneur morris. new-york, april 4, 1784. pardon me, my dear sir, not sooner having obeyed your orders respect the inclosed. i part it reluctantly; wit is so rare an article, that when we get so much it so small a compass, we cannot easily consent be dispossessed it. i am very happy hear the union your two banks; you will believe me when i tell you, that, more deliberate consideration, i was led view the competition a different light that which it first struck me. i had no doubt that it was against the interests the proprietors; but, a superficial view, i perceived benefits the community, which, a more close inspection, i found were not real. you will call our proceedings here _strange doings_. if some folks were paid counteract the prosperity the state, they could not take more effectual measures than they do. it is vain attempt kick against the pricks. discrimination bills; partial taxes; schemes engross public property the hands those who have present power; banish the real wealth the state, substitute paper bubbles; are the only dishes that suit the public palate this time. permit me ask your opinion a point importance the new-york bank--the best mode receiving paying out gold. i am aware the evils that which has been practised upon philadelphia--_weighing quantities_; i cannot satisfy myself about a substitute, unless there could be a coinage. favor me your sentiments this subject soon you can. believe me, equal warmth sincerity, yours, a. hamilton. gouverneur morris, esq. hamilton de chastellux. new-york, june 14, 1784. monsieur le chevalier: colonel clarkeson, who will have the honor delivering you this, being already known you, i give him this letter more the sake renewing you the assurances my attachment esteem, than a supposition that he will stand need any new title your attention. i will therefore only say him, that his excellent qualities cannot be known without interesting those whom they are known, that a personal warm regard him, i should be happy, if any thing i could say, could be an additional motive your countenance civilities him. i speak him the light a friend. the messenger science, he cannot fail acquire the patronage one her favorite ministers. he combines the views private satisfaction, which a voyage europe cannot afford, an undertaking the benefit a seminary learning, lately instituted this state. learning is the common concern mankind; why may not poor republicans, who can do little more than wish her well, send abroad solicit the favor her patrons friends? her ambassador will tell you his errand. i leave it your mistress _command_ the trustees the institution _ask_ your interest promoting his mission. permit me only add, that if there is any thing this country which i can contribute your satisfaction, nothing will make me happier all times, than that your commands may enable me give you proofs the respectful affectionate attachment which i have the honor be, monsieur le chevalier, your most ob’t humble serv’t, a. h. le chevalier de chastellux. gouverneur morris hamilton. philadelphia, june 30, 1784. dear hamilton: this is rather a late period acknowledge yours the seventh april. i have lived the constant intention answer it, i now execute my purpose. why not sooner? “procrastination is the thief time,” says dr. young. i meant have written fully the subject the gold. i waited some informations annapolis the probability a mint. i afterwards intended a long letter upon a subject i mentioned mr. seton, namely, a coalition between your bank the national bank. i do not find either party inclined it. yet both would be the better it. you, i believe, will soon be out blast unless it should take place. i could say a great deal this subject, it would be very useless. when you find your cash diminish very fast, remind seton my predictions, let him tell you what they were. if the legislature should attempt force paper money down your throats, it would be a good thing be somewhat independent them. i must check myself, i shall go too far into a business which would plague us both no purpose. it shall be left, therefore, until we meet. very affectionately yours, gouv. morris. alexander hamilton, esq. la fayette hamilton. albany, oct. 8, 1784. dear hamilton: * * * * * several delays have retarded the opening the treaty; when i was upon the ground, it has been found that my influence the indians, both friendly hostile tribes, was much greater than the commissioners, even myself, had conceived; so that i was requested, even every one the tribes there, speak those nations. there were some, more less, each tribe. i stayed long the commissioners thought i could do them some good; that has rather cramped my private plans visits. now, my dear friend, i am going hartford, boston, newport; thence, water, virginia, order save time; about the twentieth next month i hope be again you new-york: before that time will write you newport. adieu, my dear hamilton. most affectionately i am yours, la fayette. p.s. i am told mr. jay is not determined upon accepting. i much wish he may consent it; the more so, his probable successor not hit my fancy. indeed, i very much wish mr. jay may accept the office. colonel hamilton. la fayette hamilton. boston, oct. 22, 1784. my dear hamilton: every step i move, there comes upon me a happy necessity change my plans. the reception i met boston no words can describe; least it is impossible express what i have felt. gratitude well propriety conspired all other inducements keep me here some time longer. rhode island new hampshire i must visit, intend embarking the first second day next month virginia, the nymph frigate, which has been sent my account. less than four weeks’ time this day, i hope be congress; when my business there is concluded, will come new-york, i hope we will spend some days together. my stay your city has been too short, far inadequate the feelings my gratitude, the marks goodness bestowed upon me; this time i will be some days longer my new-york friends. upon reflecting my situation, my circumstances, my love america, yet the motives that might render it improper her employ me a public capacity, i have confined myself a plan which, the same time that it gratifies my attachment serves the united states, cannot have any shadow inconvenience. after having told me they know my zeal, i wish congress add, they want me continue those friendly, and, i might say, patriotic exertions; that consequence it, their ministers home, their ministers abroad, will have a standing order look me one whose information exertions will ever be employed the service the united states; when they think it is wanted, communicate me upon the affairs america; that congress will, whenever i think it proper, be glad my correspondence. upon that general scale, every minister may conceal me what he pleases, may write me only when he pleases; should he ever think my assistance is wanting, he has a title ask, i have one give it; my connection america is ever kept, without giving jealousy, upon such a footing will remain the disposition each public servant congress. it seems me, my dear friend, this idea already met your approbation. case it does, do promote it your delegates others. if it does not, write it me the bearer whom i send land apologize the general my delays. our friend knox has been most affectionate kind me. yours ever, la fayette. p.s. i have written wadsworth, spoken bostonians respecting the baron’s affairs. i will do the same virginia, maryland, elsewhere. alexander hamilton, esq. la fayette hamilton. paris, april 13, 1785. my dear hamilton: although i have just now written mchenry, requesting him impart my gazette you, a very barren one indeed, i feel within myself a want tell you, i love you tenderly. your brother church has sailed america, since which i had a letter his lady, who is very good health. an old letter our friend greene, i have been delighted find he consents send his son be educated mine; the idea makes me very happy. i wish, dear hamilton, you would honor me the same mark your friendship confidence. there is no fear a war, i intend visiting the prussian austrian troops. one your new-york gazettes, i find an association against the slavery negroes, which seems me worded such a way give no offence the moderate men the southern states. i ever have been partial my brethren that color, i wish, if you are one the society, you would move, your own name, my being admitted the list. my best respects wait mrs. hamilton. adieu. your affectionate friend, la fayette. john adams hamilton. grosvenor-square, london, oct. 19, 1785. sir: the instance mr. hartley, behalf his friend, mr. francis upton, i advised mr. upton apply some counsellor new-york, particularly mr. hamilton, whose reputation was known me, although his person was not. mr. hartley now requests mr. upton a letter introduction. a total stranger, character, it would be very difficult find a pretence excuse the liberty i take presenting mr. upton you, recommending his case your attention. but, we say the bar, i wish i was, _valeat quantum valere potest._ much esteem, i have the honor be, sir, your most obedient most humble servant, john adams. mr. hamilton. hamilton wilkes. november, 8, 1785. sir: the message which you sent me yesterday, your letter to-day, were conceived terms which i am little accustomed. were i consult my feelings only upon the occasion, i should return an answer very different that which i have, justice my own conduct, resolved upon. whatever light we are view each other hereafter, however harsh indelicate i may think the method you have taken obtain an explanation be, i shall, my own part, leave no room suppose that i intentionally gave you any cause complain. i shall, therefore, explicitly declare, that whatever inattention may have appeared towards you, was solely owing the continual hurry which my engagements, a long time past, have kept me; that, so far its having been occasioned any designed neglect, it was what, under the circumstances, might have happened my best friend. indeed, much what you mention have been done you, i am a stranger to. the frequent callings, yourself your servant, did not, that i recollect, come my knowledge. it is possible some them might have been mentioned me, and, the hurry my mind, forgotten. once, i remember, i saw your servant just i was going out some urgent business. i sent a verbal message, promising that i would see you; which i intended do, soon i had made up my resolution the business the interview. when i received your note i was about sending you an answer writing; but, upon inquiring your servant, finding him gone, i omitted it, an intention see you personally. you say it is near six months since you first applied me the business question. a great part the time i gave you all the answer i could give you; wit, that i had written mr. macaulay, only waited his answer. about two months since, i received it. i have been the greater part the time out town indispensable business. the intervals i have been occupied about objects immediate absolute necessity, which could not have been delayed without letting my business run into utter confusion. mr. macaulay’s concerns have been hanging upon my spirits. i have been promising myself, day day, bring them a conclusion; more pressing objects have unavoidably postponed it. i thought the delay required some apology mr. macaulay, i never dreamt having given occasion offence you. i will not, however, deny, upon a review what has passed, that there have been, through hurry inadvertency my part, appearances neglect towards you; between gentlemen men business, unfavorable conclusions ought not be drawn before explanations are asked. allowances ought be made the situations parties; the omissions men, deeply involved business, ought rather be ascribed that cause than ill intentions. had you, the first instance, expressed me (in such a manner respect yourself delicacy me dictated) your sense these appearances, i should have taken pains satisfy you that nothing improper towards you was intended me. make one my clerks the instrument communication, the bearer me a harsh accusation, was ill-judged ungenteel. take it granted that you had received an injury me, without first giving me an opportunity an explanation, couch your sense it terms so offensive some those used your letter, is an additional instance precipitation rudeness. inadvertencies susceptible misapprehension, i may commit; i am incapable intending wound injure any man who has given me no cause it; i am incapable doing any thing, sir, which i need be ashamed. the intimation, your part, is unmerited unwarrantable. after thus having explained my own conduct you, given you my ideas yours, it will depend yourself far i shall be indifferent, not, your future sentiments my character. i shall only add, that to-morrow you shall receive me my determination the matter business between us. i am, due consideration, sir, your most obedient servant, a. hamilton. john wilkes, esq. wilkes hamilton. november 9, 1785. sir: the moment i received yours, i perceived the precipitancy my own conduct, was very sorry i had so far mistaken both our characters act the manner i have done. i flatter myself, that the same candor which has dictated yours, will be exerted towards mine, that you will only view it the act a man who conceived himself injured. you have never experienced the cruel reverses fortune, you can scarcely judge the least insinuations their prejudice will affect those persons who have; much more suspicious they are the behavior mankind towards them. the morning i left the message you, i had been called upon one the creditors mr. heart, who thought it very strange no dividend was made; he insinuated, some party must be interested the delay. it is the first money transaction i have engaged since my release. i felt the insinuation alluding me, a force, which, perhaps, i should not. however, that moment i went your office. the next morning, when i saw your note mr. atkinson, found myself totally set aside a business i had, most undoubtedly, been originally neglected, i felt myself very much agitated; that frame mind i wrote my last you. so much i thought it necessary add explanation. i am convinced, now, i have been too hasty; i am sorry it. it will put me my guard future, i make no doubt prove beneficial me, provided it has not been the means hurting me your estimation, which i am now more desirous than ever obtaining. i am, sir, respect, your much obliged, most obedient servant, john wilkes. colonel hamilton. hamilton washington. november 23, 1785. dear sir: major fairly is just setting out a visit you, i believe some business relating the cincinnati. the society this state met some short time since, took into consideration the proposed alterations the original frame the institution: some were strenuous adhering the old constitution, a few adopting the new, many a middle line. this disagreement opinion, the consideration that the different state societies pursuing different courses--some adopting the alterations entire; others rejecting them the same way; others adopting part rejecting part--might beget confusion defeat good purposes, induced a proposal, which was unanimously agreed to, that a committee should be appointed prepare lay before the society, a circular letter, expressive the sense the society the different alterations proposed, recommending the giving powers a general meeting the cincinnati, make such alterations might be thought advisable, obviate objections promote the interests the society. i believe there will be no difficulty agreeing change the present mode continuing the society; it appears be the wish our members, that some other mode may be defined substituted, that it might not be left the uncertainty legislative provision. we object, too, putting the funds under legislative direction. indeed, it appears us, the legislatures will not, present, be inclined give us any sanction. i am the committee: i cannot flatter myself, that when the object is better digested, more fully explained, it will meet your approbation. the poor _baron_ is still soliciting congress, has every prospect indigence before him. he has his imprudences; but, upon the whole, he has rendered valuable services; his merits the reputation the country, alike, demand that he should not be left suffer want. if there could be any mode which your influence could be employed his favor, writing your friends congress, otherwise, the baron his friends would be under great obligations you. i have the honor be, sincere esteem, your ob’t humble serv’t, alex. hamilton. his excellency general washington. washington hamilton. mount vernon, december 11, 1785. dear sir: i have been favored your letter the twenty-third november, major fairly. sincerely do i wish that the several state societies had, would adopt the alterations that were recommended the general meeting, may, seventeen hundred eighty-four. i then thought, have had no cause since change my opinion, that if the society the cincinnati mean live peace the rest their fellow-citizens, they must subscribe the alterations which were that time adopted. that the jealousies of, prejudices against, this society, were carried an unwarrantable length, i will readily grant; that _less_ than was done, _ought_ have removed the fears which had been imbibed, i am clear in, i am that it would not have done it. it is a matter little moment, whether the alarm which seized the public mind was the result foresight, envy, jealousy, a disordered imagination: the effect perseverance would have been the same. wherein, then, would have been found an equivalent the separation interests which (from my best information, not one state only, many) would inevitably have taken place? the fears the people are not yet removed; they only sleep; a very little matter will set them afloat again. had it not been the predicament we stood respect the foreign officers the charitable part the institution, i should, that occasion, far my voice would have gone, have endeavored convince the narrow-minded part our countrymen, that the _amor patriæ_ was much stronger our breasts than theirs, that our conduct, through the whole the business, was actuated nobler more generous sentiments than were apprehended, abolishing the society once, a declaration the causes, the purity its intention. the latter may be interesting many, the former is an insuperable bar such a step. i am sincerely concerned find, your letter, that the baron is again straitened circumstances. i am much disinclined ask favors congress; if i knew what the object his wishes are, i should have much pleasure rendering him any service my power, such members that body i now then correspond with. i had flattered myself, what was told me some time ago, that congress had made a final settlement the baron much his satisfaction. i am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, g. washington. alex. hamilton, esq. hamilton nathaniel hazard. april 24, 1786. sir: your letter the twenty-first was only delivered me this morning. the good opinion liberal men i hold too high estimation not be flattered that part your letter which relates me personally. the other part i have communicated general schuyler, he assures me he will see all his friends this afternoon upon the subject; so that i have no doubt, far his influence extends, it will be employed favor the success the bill the assembly, it has already been the senate. taking this step, however, i would not be understood declare any opinion concerning the principles the bill, which i am not sufficiently acquainted form a decided opinion. i have merely made your letter the occasion introducing the subject general schuyler, whose sentiments are favorable your wishes you could desire. i make this observation that spirit candor which i hope will always direct my conduct. i am aware that i have been represented an enemy the wishes what you call your corps. if this has been meant that i do not feel much any man, not immediately interested, the distresses those merchants who have been a great measure the victims the revolution, the supposition does not do justice either my head my heart. if it means that i have always viewed the mode relieving them a matter peculiar delicacy difficulty, it is well founded. i should have thought it unnecessary enter into this explanation, were it not that i am held up a candidate the ensuing election; i would not wish that the step i have taken, respect your letter, should be considered implying more than it does; i would never wish conciliate the expense candor. the other hand, i confide your liberality not infer more than i intend the explanation i have given; hope you will believe me be, great cordiality esteem, dear sir, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. mr. hazard. cushing, dana, breck hamilton. new-york, sept. 10, 1786. gentlemen: understanding, our arrival this city last friday evening, that you had gone the convention annapolis the week past, we take the liberty acquaint you, beg you communicate the convention, if it should be opened before we arrive there, that we shall set off this place to-morrow join them, as commissioners the state massachusetts, which we hope do the course this week. the commissioners philadelphia were sail thence this city, the seventh instant, so that they may be expected soon after us. great respect, your most obedient humble servants, thomas cushing. f. t. h. dana. saml. breck. the gentlemen commissioners new-york. la fayette hamilton. paris, april 12, 1787. my dear hamilton: it is an age since i heard you. you i hear some our friends, the newspapers. although i have a right complain, i want let you know the proceedings our assembly, which, as it is unusual france, may raise your curiosity. our constitution is pretty much what it was england before it had been fairly written down minutely preserved; so that we have great claims freedom, a national representation, the denial taxes, &c., &c. disposition one hand, levity the other have manœuvred us out almost every privilege. they will still subsist, however, more less, some provinces, particularly those bretagne. now that the follies courts had obliged government saddle us new taxes, the opposition our magistrates did present itself as an obstacle the ministers, they have thought proper call an assembly notables, chosen the king, taken among the first people _each_ order, begin granting them what is more wished the nation, an assembly each province. the last assembly notables, 1626, had been obedient the ministers. this one came at a more enlightened period. it happened under a minister, who, although he has parts, is not equal some the members--men fine abilities. we are backed the nation, although not her representatives, have behaved as her interpreters, we have formed a great majority favor popular measures. the speeches the throne, those m. de calonne, have been printed: the last one contains many falsehoods. the first measure we took was the clergy declare they were ready pay the same proportion other people, the noblesse make the same declaration, reject a pecuniary privilege that was offered, lieu the other that is taken off. we have gratefully accepted the provincial elective assemblies, have united such alterations as will invigorate them. m. de calonne had made a mixture democracy despotism which did annihilate those checks gradations that are necessary evils, wherever there is a king. i think the provincial assemblies, as they are proposed us, may lay a foundation a good building. several plans the removal internal custom offices, the free exportation corn, the change the salt tax, the annihilation some duties, now the disposal the king’s domanial possessions, have been examined, underwent several alterations. some we have only left the titles the chapters, changed them, my opinion, much the better. the idea a general tax kind, was proposed the government, we said it was not practicable. as any new imposition, we have answered, it is impossible form an opinion before we know the return the exports the two last years, the plans economy that are intended. we have not, it is true, any powers the nation, our opinion is asked, a measure has become necessary, a majority us do not think their opinion can be given, until those preliminaries are fulfilled. there is a very interesting contrast between the king’s power at versailles, the opposition that assembly which is held there, divided seven committees twenty, twenty-two each, presided a prince the blood. hitherto we have not voted a general assembly, although we had some hear the minister. the opinions the committees only are now taken, the end each vote will be pronounced the whole house, beginning the last up the first rank. you know that we have the clergy, magistracy, noblesse, tiers etat. at the last meeting we had before the recess these holidays, i had a personal battle some importance. the king’s domanial property has been a pretence lavish money the princes the blood, favorites, the powerful people the country. i had the day before moved an examination those bargains, wherein more than fifty millions have been thrown away. the great people being afraid being found out, particularly m. de calonne, who is guilty the most indecent depredation, thought they must intimidate me the bishop langres, m. de la luzerne’s brother, who had seconded my motion. they, consequence it, persuaded the king have us told his brother, our president, that such motions ought be signed. upon which, we signed the inclosed paper; the bishop said, that after the rents, he would bring some accounts, signed him, the bargain sinecure, made m. de calonne. the king was very angry me; m. de calonne, who had his confidence, intended signal revenge. i was preparing support what i had said, when we suddenly heard that m. de calonne had been dismissed. the keeper the seal was also sent off. i am glad we got rid m. de calonne; his successor, who, unfortunately, is an old broken man, may improve the opportunity this assembly, let us make useful arrangements. adieu, my dear hamilton; my best respects wait mrs. hamilton. remember me gen. knox, wadsworth--all our friends, particularly the good doctor. most affectionately yours, la fayette. p. s. don’t tell the french chargé d’affairs that you have this paper me, except that there is nothing it, topics have spread every _where_. hamilton washington. new-york, july 3, 1787. dear sir: my passage through the jerseys, since my arrival here, i have taken particular pains discover the public sentiment, i am more more convinced that this is the critical opportunity establishing the prosperity this country a solid foundation. i have conversed men information, not only this city, different parts the state; they agree that there has been an astonishing revolution the better the minds the people. the prevailing apprehension among thinking men is, that the convention, the fear shocking the popular opinion, will not go far enough. they seem be convinced, that a strong, well-mounted government will better suit the popular palate, than one a different complexion. men office are, indeed, taking all possible pains give an unfavorable impression the convention; the current seems be moving strongly the other way. a plain, sensible man, a conversation i had him yesterday, expressed himself nearly this manner:--the people begin be convinced that “their excellent form government,” as they have been used call it, will not answer their purpose, that they must substitute something not very remote that which they have lately quitted. these appearances, though they will not warrant a conclusion that the people are yet ripe such a plan as i advocate, yet serve prove that there is no reason despair their adopting one equally energetic, if the convention should think proper propose it. they serve prove that we ought not allow too much weight objections drawn the supposed repugnance the people an efficient constitution. i confess, i am more more inclined believe, that former habits thinking are regaining their influence more rapidity than is generally imagined. not having compared ideas you, sir, i cannot judge far our sentiments agree; but, as i persuade myself, the genuineness my representations will receive credit you. my anxiety the event the deliberations the convention, induces me make this communication what appears be the tendency the public mind. i own you, sir, that i am seriously deeply distressed at the aspect the counsels which prevailed when i left philadelphia. i fear that we shall let slip the golden opportunity rescuing the american empire disunion, anarchy, misery. no motley feeble measure can answer the end, will finally receive the public support. decision is true wisdom, will be not less reputable the convention, than salutary the community. i shall necessity remain here ten twelve days. if i have reason believe that my attendance at philadelphia will not be mere waste time, i shall, after that period, rejoin the convention. a. hamilton. washington hamilton. philadelphia, 10th july, 1787. dear sir: i thank you your communication the 3d. when i refer you the state the councils which prevailed at the period you left this city, add that they are now, if possible, a worse train than ever; you will find little ground which the hope a good establishment can be formed. a word, i _almost_ despair seeing a favorable issue the proceedings the convention, do, therefore, repent having any agency the business. the men who oppose a strong energetic government are my opinion narrow-minded politicians, are under the influence local views. the apprehension expressed them, that the _people_ will not accede the form proposed, is the _ostensible_, not the _real_, cause the opposition; admitting that the _present_ sentiment is as they prognosticate, the question ought nevertheless be, is it is it not the best form? if the former, recommend it, it will assuredly obtain, maugre opposition. i am sorry you went away; i wish you were back. the crisis is equally important alarming, no opposition under such circumstances should discourage exertions, till the signature is fixed. i will not at this time trouble you more than my best wishes sincere regards. i am, dear sir, your obedient servant, g. washington. alexander hamilton, esq. hamilton ---- new-york, ----, 1787. dear sir: agreeably what passed between us, i have had an interview mr. auldjo, i flatter myself if there is (as i doubt not there will be) as much moderation the part major peirce as there appears be that mr. auldjo, that the affair between them may yet be amicably terminated. mr. auldjo observes, i confess my opinion propriety, that he ought know some precision the matters which have given offence major peirce, before he can enter into explanations; which he declares himself be very ready do coolness candor, the moment he shall be enabled do it a specification the subjects complaint. if a personal interview is any reason disagreeable major peirce, i entreat you, my dear sir, obtain him, communicate me letter, the substance what has occasioned his dissatisfaction, so much particularity only as will put it the power mr. auldjo give an explicit answer. major peirce will, i hope, have no scruples about this, as the door explanation has been opened mr. auldjo, there is no punctilio which stands his way; i trust he will feel the force a sentiment which prudence humanity equally dictate, that extremities ought then only ensue when, after a fair experiment, accommodation has been found impracticable. an attention this principle interests the characters both the gentlemen concerned, them our own; every other consideration, as well as that personal friendship the parties, i sincerely wish give it its full operation. i am convinced you are not less anxious effect this than myself; i trust our joint endeavors will not prove unsuccessful. i remain sincere regard, dear sir, your obedient servant, alex. hamilton. i cannot, however, conclude without making one remark. though mr. auldjo has expressed still entertains a desire explanation, it would ill become him solicit it. whatever, therefore, my expressions may seem urge such an explanation the earnestness entreaty, must be ascribed my own feelings, that inclination which every man sensibility must feel, not see extremities take place if it be his power prevent them, until they become an absolutely necessary sacrifice public opinion. i remain sincere regard, dear sir, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. hamilton auldjo. new-york, july 26, 1787. sir: i have delivered the paper you committed me, as it stood altered, major peirce, whose conduct i am conclude the affair between you is at an end. he informs me that he is shortly set out a jaunt up the north river. as you intimate a wish have my sentiments writing the transaction, i shall pleasure declare that the steps you have taken consequence mr. peirce’s challenge have been altogether conformity my opinion what would be prudent, proper, honorable your part. they seem have satisfied mr. peirce’s scruples arising what he apprehended some particulars have been your conduct him, i presume we are hear nothing further the matter. i remain great esteem, sir, your obedient humble servant, alex. hamilton. mr. auldjo. hamilton to rufus king. new-york, august 20, 1787. dear sir: since my arrival here, i have written to my colleagues, informing them if either them would come down, i would accompany him to philadelphia; so much the sake propriety public opinion. the mean time, if any material alteration should happen to be made the plan now before the convention, i will be obliged to you a communication it. i will also be obliged to you to let me know when your conclusion is at hand, i would choose to be present at that time. hamilton to wadsworth. august 20, 1787. my dear sir: the inclosed is said to be the copy a letter circulating your state. the history its appearance among us is, that it was sent one _whitmore_ stratford, formerly the paymaster general’s office, to one james reynolds this city. i am at a loss clearly to understand its object, have some suspicion, that it has been fabricated to excite jealousy against the convention, a view to an opposition to their recommendations. at all events, i wish, if possible, to trace its source, send it to you that purpose. whitmore must course say he got it, pursuing the information we may at last come at the author. let me know the political connections this man, the complexion the people most active the circulation the letter. be so good as to attend to this inquiry somewhat particularly, as i have different reasons some moment setting it foot. i remain, &c. a. hamilton. to jeremiah wadsworth. col. wadsworth to hamilton. hartford, august 26, 1787. my dear sir: i received your favor this day, the inclosed copy a letter, said to be circulating this state. some time since a paragraph the new haven papers hinted at such a letter, appeared to be written to secure the anti-federal party alarm them. i believed it was well intended, as it seemed to be meant to prepare them to comply the doings the convention, lest worse befell them; the close the letter appears to be calculated other purposes. wetmore has always associated men who wished well to america, a good government. he is half-brother to the spirited federal writer our papers, who signs himself cato; if he has really written circulated the letter question, i am quite at a loss to know his intentions. i have communicated this matter to col. humphreys, confidence, who is his way to new haven, wetmore lives, though formerly hartford. he will inquire carefully into the matter, write you. he has lived the same town wetmore, can easily fathom him. wetmore is naturally sanguine, has some talents, i believe, is enterprising, fickle. who the active people this business are, i have yet to learn, as it certainly has not circulated hereabouts. humphreys you may expect to know all that is true, wetmore’s neighborhood. i have always been humphreys’ friend, a nearer acquaintance him convinces me he is a man great integrity, such talents as would wear well any employment confidence. if he comes to new-york i wish you to be more acquainted him. i am, dear sir, your very humble servant, jerh. wadsworth. hamilton to rufus king. new-york, august 28, 1787. dear sir: i wrote you, some days since, to request you to inform me when there was a prospect your finishing, as i intended to be you, certain reasons, before the conclusion. it is whispered here, that some late changes your scheme have taken place, which give it a higher tone. is this the case? i leave town to-day to attend a circuit a neighboring county, which i shall return the last the week, shall be glad to find a line you, explanatory the period the probable termination your business. colonel humphreys to hamilton. new haven, sept. 16, 1787. my dear sir: our friend col. wadsworth has communicated to me a letter, which you made inquiries respecting a political letter that has lately circulated this state. i arrived this town yesterday, have since conversed several intelligent persons the subject. it appears to have been printed a fairfield paper as long ago as the 25th july. i have not been able to trace it to its source. mr. wetmore informs me, that when he first saw this letter it was the hands one jared mansfield, who, i believe, has formerly been reputed a loyalist. indeed it seems to have been received circulated avidity that class people, whether it was fabricated them not. i think, however, there is little doubt that it was manufactured this state. i demanded mr. wetmore what he thought were the wishes objects the writer that letter. he said, he believed it might be written principally the amusement the author, perhaps some view to learn whether the people were not absolutely indifferent to all government dead to all political sentiment. before i saw the letter question, a paragraph had been published mr. meigs, giving an account it, attempting to excite the apprehensions the anti-federalists, an idea, that the most disastrous consequences are to be expected, unless we shall accept the proceedings the convention. some think this was the real design the fictitious performance, others, more reason, that it was intended to feel the public pulse, to discover whether the public mind would be startled propositions royalty. the quondam tories have undoubtedly conceived hopes a future union great britain, the inefficacy our government, the tumults which prevailed massachusetts during the last winter. i saw a letter, written at that period, a clergyman considerable reputation nova scotia, to a person eminence this state, stating the impossibility our being happy under our present constitution, proposing (now we could think argue calmly all the consequences) that the efforts the moderate, the virtuous, the brave, should be exerted to effect a reunion the parent state. he mentioned, among other things, how instrumental the cincinnati might be, how much it would redound to their emolument. it seems, a conversation i have had here, that the ultimate practicability introducing the bishop osnaburgh is not a novel idea among those who were formerly termed loyalists. ever since the peace it has been occasionally talked wished for. yesterday, i dined, half jest--half earnest--he was given as the first toast. i leave you now, my dear friend, to reflect how ripe we are the most mad ruinous project that can be suggested, especially when, addition to this view, we take into consideration how thoroughly the patriotic part the community--the friends an efficient government, are discouraged the present system, irritated at the popular demagogues who are determined to keep themselves office, at the risk every thing. thence apprehensions are formed, that though the measures proposed the convention, may not be equal to the wishes the most enlightened virtuous, yet that they will be too high-toned to be adopted our popular assemblies. should that happen, our political ship will be left afloat a sea chance, without a rudder as well as without a pilot. i am happy to see you have (some you) had the honest boldness to attack a public paper, the anti-federal dogmas a great personage your state. go prosper. were the men talents honesty, throughout the continent, properly combined into one phalanx, i am confident they would be competent to hew their way through all opposition. were there no little jealousies, bickerings unworthy sinister views, to divert them their object, they might perseverance, establish a government calculated to promote the happiness mankind, to make the revolution a blessing instead a curse. i think it is probable that i shall soon go to the southward; the mean time, i beg you to be persuaded that i am, sentiments sincere friendship esteem, my dear hamilton, your most obedient most humble serv’t, d. humphreys. col. hamilton. hamilton to washington. 1787. dear sir: you probably saw, some time since, some animadversions certain expressions governor clinton, respecting the convention. you may have seen a piece, signed “a republican,” attempting to bring the fact into question, endeavoring to controvert the conclusions drawn it, if true. my answer you will find the inclosed. i trouble you it merely that anxiety, which is natural to every man, to have his veracity at least stand a fair light. the matter seems to be given up the governor, the fact, the inferences it, stand against him full force, operate as they ought to do. it is, however, some importance to the party to diminish whatever credit influence i may possess, to effect this, they stick at nothing. among many contemptible artifices practised them, they have had recourse to an insinuation, that i _palmed_ myself upon you, that you _dismissed_ me your family. this i confess hurts my feelings, if it obtains credit, will require a contradiction. you, sir, will undoubtedly recollect the manner which i came into your family, went out it; know how destitute foundation such insinuations are. my confidence your justice will not permit me to doubt your readiness to put the matter its true light your answer to this letter. it cannot be my wish to give any complexion to the affair which might excite the least scruple you; i confess it would mortify me to lie under the imputation, either having obtruded myself into the family a general, having been turned out it. the new constitution is as popular this city as it is possible any thing to be, the prospect thus far is favorable to it throughout the state. there is no saying what turn things may take when the full flood official influence is let loose against it. this is to be expected; though the governor has not publicly declared himself, his particular connections confidential friends are loud against it. mrs. hamilton joins respectful compliments to mrs. washington. i remain perfect esteem, your excellency’s obedient servant, a. hamilton. la fayette to hamilton. paris, october 15, 1787. my dear hamilton: while you have been attending your most important convention, debates were also going france respecting the constitutional rights, matters that kind. grave reforms are taking place at court. the parliaments are remonstrating, our provincial assemblies begin to pop out. amidst many things that were not much to the purpose, some good principles have been laid out; and, although our affairs have a proper arrangement, the nation will not the last be the loser. the prime minister is a man candor, honesty, abilities. now the rumor war sets us a-going. not that france is wishing it, great britain ought to be satisfied an advantageous treaty commerce, the profit hers prussia’s treachery holland. but, while i consider the madness the turks, the movements the imperial court, the folly his prussian majesty, the late catastrophe holland, the cry england war, i hardly think that the peaceful dispositions this ministry--and, they say, mr. pitt--will be able to extinguish a fire that is catching every corner europe. it would be consistent my inclination best views that america be engaged an active co-operation. as i do not think it consistent her interest, i have taken the liberty to express my ideas an official letter to mr. jay, to whom i refer you. it seems to me, that a friendly, helping neutrality, would be useful to france, profitable to the united states, perfectly safe the footing the treaties. should america be forced to war, i wish it would be the last campaign--time enough to occupy canada newfoundland. i see no inconvenience privateering french letters marque. inclosed is the journal a preliminary assembly auvergne. i am returning there as soon as we have done some arrangements respecting american commerce, which will result as good footing this kingdom as it is the moment possible. the ministry are more favorably disposed. i hope you will be satisfied count de maurice the countess de brehan, his sister-in-law. i beg leave to introduce them both to you mrs. hamilton, to whom i offer my most affectionate regards. remember me to the rest the family all friends. my best compliments wait gen. schuyler the doctor. adieu, my good friend. the post is going to town. i have only time to tell that i am ever your most affectionate friend, la fayette. washington to hamilton. mount vernon, october 18, 1787. dear sir: your favor, without date, came to my hand the last post. it is unfeigned concern i perceive that a political dispute has arisen between gov. clinton yourself. both you i have the highest esteem regard. as you say it is insinuated some your political adversaries, may obtain credit, “that you _palmed_ yourself upon me was _dismissed_ my family,” call upon me to do you justice a recital the facts; i do, therefore, explicitly declare, that both charges are entirely unfounded. respect to the first, i have no cause to believe that you took a single step to accomplish, had the most distant idea receiving an appointment my family till you were invited thereto. respect to the second, that your quitting it was altogether the effect your own choice. when the situation this country calls loudly unanimity vigor, it is to be lamented that gentlemen talent character should disagree their sentiments promoting the public weal; unfortunately this ever has been, more than probable ever will be, the case the affairs man. having scarcely been home since my return philadelphia, i can give little information respect to the _general_ reception the new constitution _this_ state. alexandria, however, some the adjacent counties, it has been embraced an enthusiastic warmth which i had no conception. i expect, notwithstanding, violent opposition will be given to it _some_ characters weight influence the state. mrs. washington unites me sending her best wishes mrs. hamilton yourself. i am, dear sir, your most obedient affectionate friend, g. washington. hamilton to washington. october 30, 1787. i am much obliged to your excellency the explicit manner which you contradict the insinuations mentioned my last letter. the only use i shall make your answer will be to put it into the hands a few friends. the constitution proposed has this state warm friends, warm enemies. the first impressions every where are its favor; the artillery its opponents makes some impression. the event cannot yet be foreseen. the inclosed is the first number a series papers to be written its defence. i send you also, at the request the baron de steuben, a printed pamphlet, containing the grounds an application lately made to congress. he tells me there is some reference to you, the object which he does not himself seem clearly to understand; imagines it may be your power to be service to him. there are public considerations that induce me to be somewhat anxious his success. he is fortified materials, which, europe, could not fail to establish the belief the contract he alleges. the documents service he possesses are a nature to convey an exalted idea them. the compensations he has received, though considerable, if compared those which have been received american officers, will, according to european ideas, be very scanty application to a stranger who is acknowledged to have rendered essential services. our reputation abroad is not at present too high. to dismiss an old soldier empty hungry, to seek the bounty those whom he has no claims, to complain unkind returns violated engagements, will certainly not tend to raise it. i confess, too, there is something my feelings which would incline me this case to go farther than might be strictly necessary, rather than drive a man, at the baron’s time life, who has been a faithful servant, to extremities. this is unavoidable if he does not succeed his present attempt. what he asks would, all calculations made, terminate this, an allowance his five hundred eighty guineas a year. he only wishes a recognition the contract. he knows that until affairs mend no money can be produced. i do not know how far it may be your power to do him any good; i shall be mistaken if the considerations i have mentioned do not appear to your excellency to have some weight. i remain, with great respect esteem, your excellency’s obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. washington to hamilton. mount vernon, november 10, 1787. dear sir: i thank you the pamphlet, the gazette, contained your letter the 30th ult. the remaining numbers publius, i shall acknowledge myself obliged, as i am persuaded the subject will be well handled the author. the new constitution has, as the public prints will have informed you, been handed to the people this state a unanimous vote the assembly, it is not to be inferred hence that its opponents are silenced. the contrary there are many, some powerful ones--some whom, it is said, _overshooting_ the mark, have lessened their weight; be this as it may, their assiduity stands unrivalled, whilst the friends to the constitution content themselves with barely avowing their approbation it. thus stands the matter with us at present, yet my opinion is that the major voice is favorable. application has been made to me mr. secretary thompson (by order congress), a copy the report a committee, which was appointed to confer with the baron de steuben, his first arrival this country, forwarded to me mr. president laurens. this i have accordingly sent. it throws no other light the subject than such as is to be derived the disinterested conduct the baron. no terms are made him, “nor will he accept any thing with general approbation.” i have, however, my letter inclosing this report to the secretary, taken occasion to express an unequivocal wish that congress would reward the baron his services, sacrifices, merits, to his entire satisfaction. it is the only way which i could bring my sentiments before that honorable body, as it has been an established principle with me, to ask nothing it. with very great esteem regard, i am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. hamilton to james madison, junr. new-york, april 3, 1788. i have been very delinquent, my dear sir, not thanking you your letter philadelphia. the remarks you made a certain subject are important, will be attended to. there is truly much embarrassment the case. i think, however, the principles we have talked of, are not only just, will apply to the other departments. nor will the consequences appear so disagreeable as they may seem at first sight, when we attend to the true import the rule established. the states _retain_ all the authorities they were before possessed of, not alienated the three modes pointed out; this does not include cases which are the creatures the new constitution. instance, the crime treason against the united states _immediately_ is a crime known only to the new constitution. there course _was_ no power the state constitutions to pardon that crime. there will therefore be none under the new, &c. this is something like, it seems to me, to afford the best solution the difficulty. i send you the federalist the beginning to the conclusion the commentary the executive branch. if our suspicions the author be right, he must be too much engaged to make a rapid progress in what remains. the court chancery a circuit court are now sitting. we are told that your election has succeeded, with which we all felicitate ourselves. i will thank you an account the result generally. in this state our prospects are much as you left them. a moot point which side will prevail. our friends to the northward are active. i remain, your affectionate obedient servant, a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. may 4, 1788. my dear sir: i believe i am in your debt a letter two, which is owing to my occupation in relation to the elections, &c. these are now over in this state, the result is not known. all depends upon albany, where both sides claim the victory. our doubts will not be removed till the latter end the month. i hope your expectations virginia have not diminished. respecting the first volume publius i have executed your commands. the books have been sent addressed to the care governor randolph. the second, we are informed, will be out in the course a week, an equal number shall be forwarded. inclosed is a letter, committed to my care mr. vanderkemp, which i forward with pleasure. believe me, with great attachment, yours, a. hamilton. hamilton to gouverneur morris. new-york, may 19, 1788. my dear sir: i acknowledge my delinquency in not thanking you before your obliging letter richmond. the truth is, that i have been so overwhelmed in avocations one kind another, that i have scarcely had a moment to spare to a friend. you, i trust, will be the less disposed to be inexorable, as i hope you will believe there is no one whom i have more inclination than yourself--i mean the _male_ kind. your account the situation virginia was interesting, the present appearances, as represented here, justify your conjectures. it does not, however, appear that the adoption the constitution can be considered as out doubt in that state. its conduct upon the occasion will certainly be critical importance. in this state, as far as we can judge, the elections have gone wrong. the event, however, will not certainly be known till the end the month. violence, rather than moderation, is to be looked the opposite party. obstinacy seems the prevailing trait in the character its leader. the language is, that if all the other states adopt, this is to persist in refusing the constitution. it is reduced to a certainty, that clinton has in several conversations declared the _union_ unnecessary; though i have the information through channels which do not permit a public use to be made it. we have, notwithstanding this unfavorable complexion things, two sources hope--one, the chance a ratification nine states, before we decide, the influence this upon the firmness the _followers_; the other, the probability a change sentiment in the people, auspicious to the constitution. the current has been for some time running towards it; though the whole flood official influence, accelerated a torrent falsehood, early gave the public opinion so violent a direction in a wrong channel, that it was not possible suddenly to alter its course. this is a mighty stiff simile; you know what i mean; after having started it, i did not choose to give up the chase. adieu. yours sincerely, a. hamilton. the members the convention in this city, a majority nine ten to one, will be:--john jay, robert r. livingston, richard morris, john sloss hobart, james duane, isaac rosevelt, richard harrison, nicholas low, alexander hamilton. g. morris, esq. hamilton to madison. new-york, may 19, 1788. some days since, i wrote to you, my dear sir, inclosing a letter a mr. vanderkemp, &c. i then mentioned to you that the question a majority for against the constitution, would depend upon the county albany. the later accounts that quarter, i fear much that the issue there has been against us. as clinton is truly the leader his party, is inflexibly obstinate, i count little overcoming opposition reason. our only chances will be the previous ratification nine states, which may shake the firmness his followers; a change in the sentiments the people, which have, for some time, been travelling towards the constitution, though the first impressions, made every species influence artifice, were too strong to be eradicated in time to give a decisive turn to the elections. we shall leave nothing undone to cultivate a favorable disposition in the citizens at large. the language the anti-federalists is, that if all the other states adopt, new-york ought still to hold out. i have the most direct intelligence, in a manner which forbids a public use being made it, that clinton has, in several conversations, declared his opinion the _inutility_ the union. it is an unhappy reflection, that the friends to it should, by quarrelling for straws among themselves, promote the designs its adversaries. we think here that the situation your state is critical. let me know what you now think it. i believe you meet nearly at the time we do. it will be vast importance that an exact communication should be kept up between us at that period; the moment _any decisive_ question is taken, if favorable, i request you to dispatch an express to me with pointed orders to make all possible diligence, by changing horses, &c. all expense shall be thankfully liberally paid. i executed your commands respecting the first volume the federalist. i sent forty the common copies twelve the finer ones, addressed to the care governor randolph. the printer announces the second volume in a day two, when an equal number the two kinds shall also be forwarded. he informs that the judicial department--trial by jury--bill rights, &c., is discussed in some additional papers which have not yet appeared in the gazettes. i remain, with great sincerity attachment, yours, a. hamilton. james madison. hamilton to madison. new-york, june 8, 1788. my dear sir: in my last, i think, i informed you that the elections had turned out, beyond expectation, favorable to the anti-federal party. they have a majority two-thirds in the convention, and, according to the best estimate i can form, about four-sevenths in the community. the views the leaders in this city are pretty well ascertained to be turned towards a _long_ adjournment; say, till next spring summer. their incautious ones observe, that this will give an opportunity to the state to _see how_ the government works, to act according to _circumstances_. my reasonings the fact are to this effect: the leaders the party hostile to the constitution are equally hostile to the union. they are, however, afraid to reject the constitution at once, because that step would bring matters to a crisis between this state the states which had adopted the constitution, between the parties in the state. a separation the southern district the other parts the state, it is perceived, would become the object the federalists, the neighboring states. they therefore resolve upon a long adjournment, as the safest most artful course to effect their final purpose. they suppose, that when the government gets into operation, it will be obliged to take some steps in respect to revenue, &c., which will furnish topics declamation to its enemies in the several states, will strengthen the minorities. if any considerable discontent should show itself, they will stand ready to head the opposition. if, the contrary, the thing should go smoothly, the sentiments our own people should change, they can elect to come into the union. they at all events take the chances time the chapter accidents. how far their friends in the country will go with them, i am not able to say, but, as they have always been found very obsequious, we have little reason to calculate upon an uncompliant temper in the present instance. for my own part, the more i can penetrate the views the anti-federal party in this state, the more i dread the consequences the non-adoption the constitution by any the other states--the more i fear an eventual disunion, civil war. god grant that virginia may accede. the example will have a vast influence our politics. new hampshire, all accounts give us to expect, will be an assenting state. the number the volumes the federalist which you desired, have been forwarded, as well the second as the first, to the care governor randolph. it was impossible to correct a certain error. in a former letter, i requested you to communicate to me, by express, the event any decisive question in favor the constitution, authorizing changes horses, &c., with an assurance to the person that he will be liberally paid for his diligence. a. hamilton. james madison. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 9, 1788. dear sir: the heat the weather, &c., has laid me up with a bilious attack: i am not able, therefore, to say more than a few words. no material indications have taken place since my last. the chance at present seems to be in our favor. it is possible things may take another turn. oswald philadelphia came here saturday; has closet interviews with the leaders the opposition. yours, affectionately, j. madison. alex. hamilton, esq. rufus king to hamilton. boston, june 12, 1788. dear sir: i have made an arrangement to forward by express the result the convention new hampshire to springfield, in this state, which place gen. knox has engaged a conveyance to you at poughkeepsie. those who are best informed the situation the question, in new hampshire, are positive that the decision will be such as we wish, the particular parts which i have heard, i can entertain no fear a disappointment that quarter. the accession new hampshire will present the subject to your convention in a new, indeed, an extraordinary light. i think your opponents, powerful as they may be, will be greatly perplexed, although they may outnumber you, a small majority the people the state may be their side, yet i cannot think they will have the hardiness to negative the question. you may pronounce, with the utmost confidence, that the decision our convention has proved entirely satisfactory to our people. i have made a business conversing with men from all parts the state, am completely satisfied that the constitution is highly popular; that its opponents are now very few, those few hourly diminishing. be assured that the organization the government (by _nine states_, is considered as certain), although a subject delicacy, is most earnestly desired, from the conversation both yeoman politician, i am persuaded, that the people massachusetts are sufficiently mature firm, to execute, so far as depends them, what shall be proper as good subjects the new government. farewell. yours, &c., rufus king. col. a. hamilton. pray mention to knox that i should have written to him had i not supposed him his way here. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 16, 1788. dear sir: yours the 8th has just come to hand. i mentioned in my last that oswald had been here in consultation with the anti-federal leaders. the contents your letter confirm the idea that a requisition for delay is foot between the opposition here with you. we have conjectured for some days, that the policy is to spin out the session, in order to receive overtures from your convention; or, if that cannot be, to weary the members into an adjournment, without taking any decision. it is presumed, at the same time, that they do not despair carrying the point previous amendments, which is preferable game. the parties continue to be nearly balanced. if we have a majority at all, it does not exceed three four. if we lose it, kentucke will be the cause; they are generally, if not unanimously against us. i have been partially recovered since my last, to-day have a sort relapse. my health is not good, the business is wearisome beyond expression. i wish you every happiness, am yours, j. madison, jr. h. lee to hamilton. 1788. my dear sir: god bless you your efforts to save me from the manifold ---- misfortunes which have continue to oppress me, whenever i attempt to aid human nature. you will do what you think best, whatever you do i will confirm. * * * * has acted the part a decided rascal, if i fail in my right, i may not in personal revenge. our convention is in full debate the great business the federal constitution. we possess, as yet, in defiance great overtures, a majority, very small indeed. a correspondence has certainly been opened through a mr. o. philadelphia, from the malcontents p. n. y. to us. it has its operation, i believe we are still safe, unless the question adjournment be introduced, love home may induce some our friends to abandon their principles. adieu, h. lee. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 20, 1788. dear sir: our debates have advanced as far as the judiciary department, against which a great effort is making. the appellate cognizance fact, an extension the power to causes between citizens different states, with some lesser objections, are the topics chiefly dwelt on. the retrospection to cases antecedent to the constitution, such as british debts, an apprehended revival the fairfax, indiana, vandalia, &c., claims, are also brought into view in all the terrific colors which imagination can give them. a few days more will probably produce a decision, though it is surmised, that something is expected from your convention in consequence the mission formerly suggested to you. delay an adjournment will be tried, if the adverse party find their numbers inferior, can prevail themselves to remain here till the other side can be wearied into that mode relieving themselves. at present, it is calculated, that we still retain a majority three four; if we can weather the storm against the part under consideration, i shall hold the danger to be pretty well over. there is nevertheless a very disagreeable uncertainty in the case; the more so, as there is a possibility that our present strength may be miscalculated. yours, affectionately, j. madison, jr. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, june, 1788. dear sir: your letter the 20th came to hand two days since. i regret that your prospects are not yet reduced to greater certainty. there is more more reason to believe that our conduct will be influenced by yours. our discussions have not yet travelled beyond the power taxation. to-day we shall probably quit this ground to pass to another. our arguments confound, do not convince. some the leaders, however, appear to be convinced by _circumstances_, to be desirous a retreat. this does not apply to the chief, who wishes to establish clintonism the basis anti-federalism. i remain affectionately yours, a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, june 21, 1788. yesterday, my dear sir, the convention made a house. that day this have been spent in preliminary arrangements. to-morrow, we go into a committee the whole the constitution. there is every appearance that a full discussion will take place, which will keep us together at least a fortnight. it is not easy to conjecture what will be the result. our adversaries greatly outnumber us. the leaders gave indications a pretty desperate disposition in private conversations previous to the meeting; i imagine the minor partisans have their scruples, an air moderation is now assumed. so far the thing is not despaired of. a happy issue with you must have considerable influence upon us. i have time to add nothing more than the assurances my sincere attachment. a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, june 21, 1788. my dear sir: i thank you for your letter the 9th instant, am glad to learn that you think the chance is in your favor. i hope no disagreeable change may appear. yet, i own i fear something from your indisposition. our debate here began the clause respecting the proportion representation, &c., which has taken up two days. to-morrow, i imagine, we shall talk about the power over elections. the only good information i can give you is, that we shall be some time together, take the chance events. the object the party at present is undoubtedly conditional amendments. what effect events may have cannot precisely be foreseen. i believe the adoption by new hampshire is certain. yours, affectionately, a. hamilton. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 22, 1788. dear sir: the judiciary department has been the anvil for several days, i presume will still be a further subject disquisition. the attacks on it have apparently made less impression than was feared. they may be secretly felt by particular interests that could not make the acknowledgment, we choose to ground their vote against the constitution in other motives. in the course this week we hope for a close the business in some form other. the opponents will probably bring forward a bill rights, with sundry other amendments, as conditions ratification. should these fail, be despaired of, an adjournment will, i think, be attempted. in case disappointment here also, some predict a secession. i do not myself concur in the last apprehension, though i have thought it prudent to withhold, by a studied fairness in every step on the side the constitution, every pretext for rash experiments. the plan meditated by the friends the constitution is to preface the ratification with some plain general truths that cannot affect the validity the act, to subjoin a recommendation, which may hold up amendments as objects to be pursued in the constitutional mode. these expedients are rendered prudent by the nice balance numbers, the scruples entertained by some who are in general well affected. whether they will secure us a majority, i dare not positively to declare. our calculations promise us success by three four, possibly five six votes. were there no possibility mistaking the opinions some, in reviewing those so many, the smallness the majority suggests the danger from ordinary casualties, which may vary the result. it unluckily happens that our legislature, which meets at this place to-morrow, consists a considerable majority anti-federal members. this is another circumstance that ought to check our confidence. as individuals they may have some influence; and, as coming immediately from the people at large, they can give any color they please to the popular sentiments at this moment, may in that mode throw a bias on the representatives the people in convention. yours, affectionately, j. madison, jr. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, friday morning, june 27, 1788. a day two ago, general schuyler, at my request, sent forward to you an express with an account the adoption the constitution by new hampshire. we eagerly wait for further intelligence from you, as our chance success depends upon you. there are some slight symptoms relaxation in some the leaders, which authorizes a gleam hope, if you do well, certainly i think not otherwise. a. hamilton. to hon. james madison, jr. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 27, 1788. my dear sir: this day put an end to the existence our convention. the inclosed is a copy the act ratification. it has been followed by a number recommendatory alterations, many them highly objectionable. one the most so is an article prohibiting direct taxes where effectual laws shall be passed by the states for the purpose. it was impossible to prevent this error. the minority will sign an address to the people. the genius it is unknown to me. it is announced as an exhortation to acquiesce in the result the convention. notwithstanding the fair propositions made by some, i am so uncharitable as to suspect, that the ill-will to the constitution will produce every peaceable effort to disgrace destroy it. mr. henry declared, previous to the final question, that although he should submit as a quiet citizen, he should wait with impatience for the favorable moment regaining, in a _constitutional way_, the lost liberties his country. my conjecture is, that exertions will be made to engage two-thirds the legislatures in the task regularly undermining the government. this hint may not be unworthy your attention. yours, affectionately, j. madison, jr. madison to hamilton. june 31, 1788. inclosed is the final result our conventional deliberations. the intended address the minority proved to be a nature apprehended by me. it was rejected by the party themselves, when proposed to them, produced an auspicious conclusion to the business. as i shall set out in a few days for new-york, i postpone further explanations. i have this instant the communications from new hampshire via poughkeepsie; also, your two favors the 19th 20th. yours, affectionately, j. madison, jr. hamilton to madison. july 8, 1788. my dear sir: i felicitate you sincerely on the event in virginia, my satisfaction will be allayed if i discover too much facility in the business amendment-making. i fear the system will be wounded in some its vital parts by too general a concurrence in some very injudicious recommendations. i allude more particularly to the power taxation. the more i consider _requisition_ in any shape, the more i am out humor with it. we yesterday passed through the constitution. to-day some definitive proposition is to be brought forward, what we are at a loss to judge. we have good reason to believe that our opponents are not agreed, this affords some ground hope. different things are thought of--_conditions precedent_, previous amendments; _conditions subsequent_, the proposition amendments, upon condition that if they are not adopted within a limited time, the state shall be at liberty to _withdraw_ from the union; lastly, _recommendatory amendments_. in either case, _constructive declarations_ will be carried as far as possible. we will go as far as we can in the latter without invalidating the act, will concur in rational recommendations. the rest for our opponents. we are informed there has been a disturbance in the city albany, on the 4th july, which has occasioned bloodshed. the anti-federalists were the aggressors, the federalists the victors. thus stand our accounts at present. we trust, however, the matter has passed over, tranquillity been restored. yours, affectionately, a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, saturday, july, 1788. i thank you, my dear sir, for yours by the post. yesterday, i communicated to duer our situation, which i presume he will have communicated to you. it remains exactly the same. no further question having been taken, i fear the footing i mentioned to duer is the best upon which it can be placed; every thing possible will yet be attempted to bring the party from that stand to an unqualified ratification. let me know your idea upon the possibility our being received on that plan. you will understand that the only qualification will be the _reservation_ a right to recede, in case our amendments have not been decided upon in one the modes pointed out by the constitution within a certain number years, perhaps five seven. if this can in the first instance be admitted as a ratification, i do not fear any further consequences. congress will, i presume, recommend certain amendments to render the _structure_ the government more secure. this will satisfy the more considerate honest opposers the constitution, with the aid them will break up the party. yours, affectionately, a. hamilton. madison to hamilton. new-york, sunday evening. my dear sir: yours, yesterday, is this instant come to hand, i have a few minutes to answer it. i am sorry that your situation obliges you to listen to propositions the nature you describe. my opinion is, that a reservation a right to withdraw, if amendments be not decided on under the form the constitution within a certain time, is a _conditional_ ratification; that it does not make new-york a member the new union, consequently that she could not be received on that plan. compacts must be reciprocal--this principle would not in such a case be preserved. the constitution requires an adoption _in toto_ _for ever_. it has been so adopted by the other states. an adoption for a limited time would be as defective as an adoption some the articles only. in short, any _condition_ whatever must vitiate the ratification. what the new congress, by virtue the power to admit new states, may be _able_ disposed to do in such case, i do not inquire, as i suppose that is not the material point at present. i have not a moment to add more than my fervent wishes for your success happiness. the idea reserving a right to withdraw was started at richmond, considered as a conditional ratification, which was itself abandoned as worse than a rejection. yours, james madison, jr. chipman to hamilton. tinmouth, july 14, 1788. sir: your character as a federalist has induced me, although, personally unknown to you, to address you on a subject very great importance to the state vermont, which i am a citizen, from which i think may be derived a considerable advantage to the federal cause. ten states have now adopted the new federal plan government. that it will now succeed is beyond a doubt; what disputes the other states may occasion i know not. the people this state, could certain obstacles be removed, i believe, might be induced almost unanimously to throw themselves into the federal scale. you are not unacquainted with the situation a considerable part our landed property. many grants were formerly made by the government new-york, lands within this territory while under that jurisdiction. on the assumption government by the people this state, the same lands, partly, it is said, for want information respecting the true situation these grants, partly from the opinion prevailing with our then leaders, that the new-york grants within this territory were no validity, have been granted to others under the authority this state. it is now generally believed that, should we be received into the union, the new-york grants would, in the federal courts, be preferred to those vermont. the legislature this state have in some instances made a compensation to the grantees under new-york, i am persuaded, were it in their power, would gladly do the same for others, they are possessed no more land for that purpose. for these reasons, i presume no others, the governor some few gentlemen deeply interested in those lands under vermont, have expressed themselves somewhat bitterly against the new federal plan government. indeed, were we to be admitted unconditionally it would introduce much confusion. now, sir, permit me to ask whether you do not think it probable that the federal legislature, when formed, might, on our accession, be induced on some terms to make a compensation to the new-york grantees out their western land? whether those grantees might not be induced to accept such compensation? let me further suggest whether it might be favorable for vermont to make some those amendments, which have been proposed by several states, which, i think, are generally within the power the federal legislature, the basis her admission. could the difficulties i have mentioned be removed, all interest in opposition could here be reconciled. the idea procuring justice to be done those whom we had perhaps injured by our too precipitate measures, being connected with a government which promises to be efficient, permanent, honorable, would, i am persuaded, produce the greatest unanimity on the subject. if you think these matters worthy the attention the friends the confederacy, be good enough to write me by my brother, who will be the bearer this. our legislature will meet in october, when these matters will be taken up seriously. several gentlemen my acquaintance, who are men influence, will be members the legislature, have requested me to procure all the information in my power on this subject. any thing you may communicate to me in confidence will be sacredly attended to, which mr. kelly, who writes by the same opportunity, will give you the fullest assurance. i am, sir, with sentiments esteem, your most obedient servant, nathaniel chipman. alex. hamilton, esq. hamilton to chipman. poughkeepsie, july 22, 1788. sir: your brother delivered me your favor, which i received with pleasure, as the basis a correspondence that may be productive public good. the accession vermont to the confederacy is, doubtless, an object great importance to the whole; it appears to me that this is the favorable moment for effecting it upon the best terms for all concerned. besides more general reasons, there are circumstances the moment which will forward a proper arrangement. one the first subjects deliberation with the new congress will be the independence kentucky, for which the southern states will be anxious. the northern will be glad to send a counterpoise in vermont. these mutual interests inclinations will facilitate a proper result. i see nothing that can stand in your way the interfering claims under the grants new-york. as to taxation, the natural operation the new system will place you exactly where you might wish to be. the public debt, as far as it can prudently be provided for, will be by the western lands the appropriation some general fund. _there will be no distribution it to particular parts the community._ the fund will be sought for in indirect taxation; as for a number years, except in time war, direct taxes would be an impolitic measure. hence, as you can have no objection to your proportion contribution as consumers, you can fear nothing from the article taxation. i readily conceive that it will hardly be practicable to you to come into the union unless you are secured from claims under new-york grants. upon the whole, therefore, i think it will be expedient for you, as early as possible, to ratify the constitution, “upon condition that congress shall provide for the extinguishment all existing claims to land under grants the state new-york, which may interfere with claims under the grants the state vermont.” you will do well to conform your boundary to that heretofore marked out by congress, otherwise insuperable difficulties would be likely to arise with this state. i should think it altogether unadvisable to annex any other conditions to your ratification; for there is scarcely any the amendments proposed that will not have a party opposed to it, there are several that will meet with a very strong opposition; it would, therefore, be highly inexpedient for you to embarrass your main object by any collateral difficulties. as i write in convention, i have it not in my power to enlarge. you will perceive my general ideas on the subject. i will only add, that it will be wise to lay as little impediment as possible in the way your reception into the union. a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, july 22, 1788. my dear sir: i wrote to you by the last post, since which nothing material has turned up here. we are debating on amendments without having decided what is to be done with them. there is so great a diversity in the views our opponents that it is impossible to predict any thing. upon the whole, however, our fears diminish. yours affectionately, a. hamilton. james madison, jr., new-york. hamilton to samuel broome. new-york, aug. 6, 1788. my dear sir: i have this moment received your letter the thirteenth ultimo, am sorry that the rules propriety in respect to my situation, as a member congress, will not permit my acting in the capacity you wish. my situation for some time past has prevented my acknowledging one two your favors, which have been duly handed to me. i recollect that one them contains an inquiry concerning your son, to which you will naturally desire an answer. my public avocations, for some time past, have put it out my power to ascertain the progress he has made; though i expect, when i shall be enough disengaged to examine, to find it a good one. it cannot fail to be so, if his diligence has been equal to his capacity. i shall shortly write you further on the subject. with great esteem, i remain, sir, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. mr. samuel broome. hamilton to washington. new-york, august 18, 1788. sir: captain cochran the british navy has requested my aid in recovering a family watch in the possession ----. in compliance with his request, i have written the letter herewith (to ---- ----), which i take the liberty to convey through you, in hope that if you see no impropriety in it, you would add your influence to the endeavor to gratify captain cochran. it is one those things in which the affections are apt to be interested beyond the value the object, in which one naturally feels an inclination to oblige. i have delivered to mr. madison, to be forwarded to you, a set the papers under the signature publius, neatly enough bound to be honored with a place in your library. i presume you have understood that the writers these papers are chiefly mr. madison myself, with some aid from mr. jay. i take it for granted, sir, you have concluded to comply with what will no doubt be the general call your country in relation to the new government. you will permit me to say that it is indispensable you should lend yourself to its first operations. it is little purpose to have _introduced_ a system, if the weightiest influence is not given to its firm _establishment_ in the outset. i remain with the greatest esteem, your obedient humble servant, a. hamilton. general washington. hamilton to governor livingston. new-york, august 29, 1788. dear sir: we are informed here, that there is some probability that your legislature will instruct your delegates to vote for philadelphia as the place the meeting the first congress under the new government. i presume this information can hardly be well founded, as upon my calculations, there is not a state in the union so much interested in having the temporary residence at new-york, as new jersey. as between philadelphia new-york, i am mistaken if a greater proportion your state will not be benefited by having the seat government at the latter than the former place. if at the latter, too, its exposed eccentric position will necessitate the early establishment a permanent seat, in passing south, it is highly probable the government would light upon the delaware in new jersey. the northern states do not wish to increase pennsylvania, by an accession all the wealth population the federal city. pennsylvania, herself, when not seduced by _immediate possession_, will be glad to concur in a situation on the jersey side the delaware. here are at once a majority the states; place the government once down in pennsylvania, pennsylvania will, course, hold fast; the state delaware will do the same. all the states south, looking forward to the time, when the balance population will enable them to carry the government further south (say to the potomac), being accommodated in the mean time as well as they wish, will concur in no change. the government, from the delay, will take root in philadelphia, jersey will lose all prospect the federal city within her limits. these appear to me calculations so obvious, that i cannot persuade myself new jersey will so much _oversee_ her interest as to fall, in the present instance, into the snares pennsylvania. with the sincerest respect regard, i remain, dear sir, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. chipman to hamilton. newfane, sept. 6, 1788. sir: i have received by capt. ville, your favor the 22d july. since i wrote you, i have had an opportunity conversing with his excellency, the governor, most the council, on the subject vermont’s accession to the confederacy. they generally agree, that the terms suggested are good; that it will be highly the interest vermont to accede; that the present is likely to be a favorable crisis. it is a question whether we ought to make any propositions to the present congress, prepare matters, wait the new arrangement. vermont will not make a point introducing any amendments. we shall not be the first to feel the inconveniences, if any should arise, from the exercise the new federal powers. for myself, i readily conceive, that direct taxation, under the new system, will be very inconsiderable during the continuance peace; yet i find an exemption from the expenses the late war will have with the citizens this state a very powerful effect in producing unanimity on the subject a union. i hope this matter will in some way be compromised. if, sir, you have any thing to suggest on this subject, that may promote the public good, i should be very happy in the communication, previous to the session assembly in october next. the choice representatives, which was on tuesday last, has, as far as i have heard, succeeded favorably. mr. kelly, who is so obliging as to take charge this letter, will be able to give you a more particular account than can be done in this way, as he has conversed largely with the governor, council, other persons influence, with whom he has great weight. i am, sir, with much esteem respect, your most obedient servant, nathl. chipman. a. hamilton, esq. hamilton to washington. new-york, september, 1788. dear sir: your excellency’s friendly obliging letter the 28th ultimo, came safely to hand. i thank you for your assurance seconding my application to general ----. the truth that affair is, that he purchased the watch for a trifle a british soldier, who plundered major cochran, at the moment his fall, at yorktown. i should be deeply pained, my dear sir, if your scruples in regard to a certain station, should be matured into a resolution to decline it; though i am neither surprised at their existence, nor can i agree in opinion, that the caution you observe, in deferring an ultimate determination, is prudent. i have, however, reflected maturely on the subject, have come to a conclusion (in which i feel no hesitation), that every public personal consideration will demand from you an acquiescence in what will _certainly_ be the unanimous wish your country. the absolute retreat which you meditated at the close the late war was natural, proper. had the government produced by the revolution, gone on in a _tolerable_ train, it would have been most advisable to have persisted in that retreat. i am clearly opinion, that the crisis which brought you again into public view, left you no alternative to comply; i am equally clear in the opinion, that you are by that act _pledged_ to take a part in the execution the government. i am not less convinced, that the impression this necessity your filling the station in question, is so universal, that you run no risk any uncandid imputation by submitting to it. even if this were not the case, a regard to your own reputation, as well as to the public good, calls upon you in the strongest manner, to run that risk. it cannot be considered as a compliment to say, that on your acceptance the office president, the success the new government, in its commencement, may materially depend. your agency influence will be not less important in preserving it from the future attacks its enemies, than they have been in recommending it in the first instance, to the adoption the people. independent all considerations drawn from this source, the point light in which you stand at home abroad, will make an infinite difference in the respectability with which the government will begin its operations, in the alternative your being not being at the head it. i forbear to urge considerations which might have a more personal application. what i have said will suffice for the inferences i mean to draw. first. in a matter so essential to the well-being society, as the prosperity a newly instituted government, a citizen so much consequence as yourself to its success, has no option to lend his services if called for. permit me to say, it would be inglorious, in such a situation, not to hazard the glory, however great, which he might have previously acquired. secondly. your signature to the proposed system, pledges your judgment for its being such an one as, upon the whole, was worthy the public approbation. if it should miscarry (as men commonly decide from success, the want it), the blame will, in all probability, be laid on the system itself; the framers it will have to encounter the disrepute having brought about a revolution in government, without substituting any thing that was worthy the effort. they pulled down one utopia, it will be said, to build up another. this view the subject, if i mistake not, my dear sir, will suggest to your mind greater hazard to that fame, which must be ought to be dear to you, in refusing your future aid to the system, than in affording it. i will only add, that in my estimate the matter, that aid is indispensable. i have taken the liberty to express these sentiments, to lay before you my view the subject. i doubt not the considerations mentioned, have fully occurred to you, i trust they will finally produce in your mind the same result which exists in mine. i flatter myself, the frankness with which i have delivered myself will not be displeasing to you. it has been prompted by motives which you would not disapprove. i remain, my dear sir, with the sincerest respect regard, your obedient humble servant, a. hamilton. steuben to hamilton. le 5 de sept. 1788. monsieur, la lettre c’y joint de mr. r. peters, contienne une preuve, non équivoque, que dans mes premières applications et immédiatement après la paix, j’ai appuyé mes prétentions aux e. u. sur une stipulation ou contract fait en entrant dans leur service. comme vous étiez de cette même committée à philadelphie, je m’en rapporte à votre mémoire. dans tous les committées subséquentes j’ai toujours appuyé sur ce même contract, et je me rapporte à tous les messieurs qui successivement furent des committées sur ce sujet. comme vous étes de la presente congrès, je vous prie de communiquer la reporte de mr. peters à cette committée. j’ai l’honneur d’ètre avec affection, monsieur, votre très humble, steuben. alexander hamilton. hamilton to theodore sedgewick. new-york, oct. 9, 1788. your last letter one met me at albany attending court, whence i am just returned. i am sorry for the schism you hint at among the federalists, i have so much confidence in the good management the fast friends the constitution, that i hope no ill consequences will ensue from that disagreement. it will, however, be worthy great care to avoid suffering a difference opinion on collateral points, to produce any serious division between those who have hitherto drawn together on the great national question. permit me to add, that i do not think you should allow any line to be run between those who wish to trust alterations to future experience, those who are desirous them at the present juncture. the rage for amendments is, in my opinion, rather to be parried by address than encountered with open force; i should therefore be loth to learn that your parties had been arrayed professedly upon the distinction i have mentioned. the mode in which amendments may best be made, twenty other matters, may come as pretexts for avoiding the evil, securing the good. yours, a. hamilton. hamilton to chipman. 1788. sir: your favor the 6th september has been duly handed to me, i receive great pleasure from the hopes you appear to entertain a favorable turn affairs in vermont in regard to the new government. it is certainly an object mutual importance to yourselves, to the union, well deserves the best endeavors every discerning good man. i observe with satisfaction your opinion that vermont will not make a point introducing amendments. i mean as a condition her accession. that ground would be the most hazardous which she could venture upon, as it is very probable that such amendments as might be popular with you would be deemed inadmissible by the friends the system, who will doubtless be the most influential persons in the national councils; who would rather submit to the inconvenience your being out the union, till circumstances should alter, than consent to any thing that might impair the energy the government. the article taxation is, above all, the most delicate thing to meddle with; for as _plenary_ power in that respect must ever be considered as the vital principle government, no abridgment constitutional suspension that power can ever, upon mature consideration, be countenanced by the intelligent friends an effective national government. you must, as i remarked in my former letter, rely upon the natural course things, which i am satisfied will exempt you in ordinary times from direct taxation, on account the difficulty exercising it in so extensive a country, so peculiarly situated, with advantage to the revenue satisfaction to the people. though this difficulty will be gradually diminished from various causes, a considerable time must first elapse; and, in the interim, you will have nothing to apprehend on this score. as far as indirect taxation is concerned, it will be impossible to exempt you from sharing in the burthen, nor can it be desired by your citizens. i repeat these ideas to impress you the more strongly with my sense the danger touching this chord, the impolicy perplexing the main object with any such collateral experiments, while i am glad to perceive that you do not think your people will be tenacious on the point. it will be useless for you to have any view in your act to the present congress. they can course do nothing in the matter. all you will have to do, will be to pass an act accession to the new constitution, on the conditions upon which you mean to rely. it will then be for the new government, when met, to declare whether you can be received on your terms not. i am sorry to find that the affair boundary is likely to create some embarrassment. men’s minds, every where out your state, are made up upon reconciled to that which has been delineated by congress. any departure from it must beget new discussions, in which all the passions will have their usual scope, may occasion greater impediments than the real importance the thing would justify. if, however, the further claims you state cannot be gotten over with you, i would still wish to see the experiment made, though with this clog, because i have it very much at heart that you should become a member the confederacy. it is, however, not to be inferred that the same disposition will actuate every body. in this state, the pride certain individuals has too long triumphed over the public interest; in several the southern states a jealousy northern influence will prevent any great zeal for increasing in the national councils the number northern votes. i mention these circumstances (though i dare say they will have occurred to you), to show you the necessity moderation caution on your part, the error any sanguine calculation upon a disposition to receive you at any rate. a supposition this nature might lead to fatal mistakes. in the event an extension your boundary beyond the congressional line, would it be impracticable for you to have commissioners appointed to adjust any differences which might arise? i presume the principal object with you in the extension your boundary would be to cover some private interests. this might be matter negotiation. there is one thing which i think it proper to mention to you, about which i have some doubt; that is, whether a legislative accession would be deemed valid. it is the policy the system to lay its foundations in the _immediate_ consent the people. you will best judge how far it is safe practicable to have recourse to a convention. whatever you do, no time ought to be lost. the present moment is undoubtedly critically favorable. let it by all means be improved. i remain, with esteem, sir, your obedient humble servant, a. hamilton. nathaniel chipman, esq. washington to hamilton. mount vernon, october 3, 1788. dear sir: in acknowledging the receipt your candid friendly letter ---- by the last post, little more is incumbent on me than to thank you sincerely for the frankness with which you communicated your sentiments; to assure you that the same manly tone intercourse will always be more than barely welcome. indeed, it will be highly acceptable to me. i am particularly glad, in the present instance, you have dealt thus freely like a friend. although i could not help observing from several publications letters, that my name had been sometimes spoken of, that it was possible the _contingency_ which is the subject your letter might happen; yet i thought it best to maintain a guarded silence to back the _counsel_ my best friends (which i certainly hold in the highest estimation), rather than to hazard an imputation unfriendly to the delicacy my feelings. for, situated as i am, i could hardly bring the question into the slightest discussion, ask an opinion, even in the most confidential manner, without betraying, in my judgment, some impropriety conduct, without feeling an apprehension that a premature display anxiety might be construed into a vain-glorious desire pushing myself into notice as a candidate. now, if i am not grossly deceived in myself, i should unfeignedly rejoice in case the electors, by giving their votes in favor some other person, would save me from the disagreeable dilemma being forced to accept refuse. if that may not be, i am in the next place earnestly desirous searching out the truth, knowing whether there does not exist a probability that the government would be just as happily effectually carried into execution without my aid as with it. i am _truly_ solicitous to obtain all the previous information, which the circumstances will afford, to determine (when the determination can with propriety be no longer postponed) according to the principles right reason the dictates a clear conscience, without too great a reference to the unforeseen consequences which may affect my person reputation. until that period, i may fairly hold myself open to conviction, though i allow your sentiments to have weight in them; i shall not pass by your arguments without giving them as dispassionate a consideration as i can possibly bestow on them. in taking a survey the subject in whatever point light i have been able to place it, i will not suppress the acknowledgment, my dear sir, that i have always felt a kind gloom upon my mind as often as i have been taught to expect i might, perhaps must, ere long be called to make a decision. you will, i am well assured, believe the assertion (though i have little expectation it would gain credit from those who are less acquainted with me), that if i should receive act under the appointment, the acceptance would be attended with more diffidence reluctance than ever i experienced before in my life. it would be, however, with a fixed sole determination lending whatever assistance might be in my power to promote the public weal, in hopes that, at a convenient an early period, my services might be dispensed with, that i might be permitted once more to retire, to pass an unclouded evening after the stormy day life, in the bosom domestic tranquillity. why these anticipations? if the friends the constitution conceive that my administering the government will be the means its acceleration strength, is it not probable that the adversaries thereof may entertain the same ideas, course make it an object opposition? that many this description will be amongst the electors, i have no more doubt than i have the part they will act at the election, which will be adverse to the choice any character who, from whatever cause, would be likely to thwart their views. it might be impolitic perhaps in them to make this declaration _previous_ to the election, i shall be out in my conjectures if they do not act conformably thereto at it, prove that all the _seeming_ moderation by which their present conduct is marked, is calculated to lull deceive. their plan opposition is systematized, a regular intercourse between the leaders it in the several states (i have much reason to believe) is formed to render it more effectual. with sentiments sincere regard esteem, i am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, george washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. hamilton to theodore sedgewick. new-york, october 9, 1788. i thank you, my dear sir, for your obliging congratulations on the event towards effecting which your aid as a joint laborer was so essential. i hope experience may show that, while it promotes the interest this place, it will not be incompatible with public good. we are making efforts to prepare handsome accommodations for the session the new congress. on the subject vice-president, my ideas have concurred with yours, i believe mr. adams will have the votes this state. he will certainly, i think, be preferred to the other gentleman. yet _certainly_ is perhaps too strong a word. i can conceive that the other, who is supposed to be a more pliable man, may command anti-federal influence. the only hesitation in my mind with regard to mr. adams has arisen within a day two, from a suggestion by a particular gentleman that he is unfriendly in his sentiments to general washington. richard h. lee, who will probably, as rumor now runs, come from virginia, is also in this style. the lees adams’s have been in the habit uniting, hence may spring up a cabal very embarrassing to the executive, course to the administration the government. consider this,--sound the reality it, let me hear from you. what think you lincoln knox? this is a flying thought. yours, with sincere regard, a. hamilton. mr. sedgewick. sedgewick to hamilton. stockbridge, oct. 16, 1788. my dear sir: your favor the 9th i have this moment received, detain the post a while that i may make a very few observations on a subject i conceive highly interesting to the efficient operations the future government. mr. adams was formerly infinitely more democratical than at present, possessing that jealousy which always accompanied such a character, he was averse to repose such unlimited confidence in the commander-in-chief as then was the disposition congress. mr. adams is not among the number my particular friends, but, as a man unconquerable intrepidity, incorruptible integrity, as greatly experienced in the interests character this country, he possesses my highest esteem. his writings show that he deserves the confidence those who wish energy in government, for although those writings are too tedious unpleasant in perusal, yet they are evidently the result deep reflection, as they encounter popular prejudices are an evidence an erect independent spirit. lincoln knox i love, their characters, too, i respect, it is now too late to push in this state the interests either. the minds all men here seem to be fixed either on adams hancock. our legislature meet on the 29th. from boston i will early write you on the subject, am with sincere respect, yours, affectionately, theodore sedgewick. hon. mr. hamilton. sedgewick to hamilton. boston, nov. 2, 1788. my dear sir: in my last hasty letter i engaged to write to you soon after my arrival in this town. various questions will be agitated in the legislature (of considerable magnitude) which respect the organization the government. there is a party federalists who are opinion, that the electors should be chosen by the people, the representatives not in districts, at large. these will be joined by all the antis probably. i yet hope they will not succeed. we yesterday committed to a committee both houses the circular letter from your convention. the event is uncertain, a considerable number federalists have been brought over to the amendment system. the prospect is, notwithstanding, that the real friends the constitution will prevail. every thing depends upon it, the exertion will be proportionate to the magnitude the object. should the electors be chosen by the legislature, mr. adams will probably combine all the votes massachusetts. i am very certain, that the suggestion that he is unfriendly to general washington, is entirely unfounded. mr. hancock has been very explicit in patronizing the doctrine amendment. the other gentleman is for postponing the conduct that business until it shall be understood from experience. * * * * i am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, theodore sedgewick. the hon. mr. hamilton. col. olney to hamilton. providence, 3d nov., 1788. dear sir: your favor 6th ulto., was duly received. i thought proper to postpone replying to it till after the session the general assembly should be over, which terminated on saturday night last, in order that i might have it in my power to give you, with more certainty, the proceedings the legislature, on the subject the new constitution. the minority, both in the house, took unwearied pains during the session, to procure a convention in the legal mode pointed out for considering the new constitution; but, sir, it proved, as heretofore, an unsuccessful attempt; for mr. hazard, who is an implacable powerful enemy to the new system, the leading character in all the vile politics carrying on in this _devoted_ state, had so well prepared the majority, that when the question was put, whether this state should appoint a convention not, the question was lost nearly three to one; fifteen in favor the motion forty-four against it. after which (late on saturday night) mr. hazard moved that a vote be passed, for printing copies the circular letter from the convention new-york, to be distributed throughout this state, submitting to the people at large, the propriety appointing delegates to meet a _proposed_ convention, for considering amendments, agreeably to the recommendations said circular letter. the vote being put, after much debate, it was carried in favor the measure by three to one, notwithstanding every exertion the minority, to prevent the adoption so novel unprecedented a proceeding. it was urged, with truth, that should a convention finally meet for the purpose amending the constitution, that it would be composed entirely the adopting states; and, as such, this state could not, upon any principles right, expect to be admitted to a seat in that honorable body, as we so obstinately (and with our eyes open) have refused, still neglect to accede to the new system. but, sir, reason argument will avail nothing with those wicked designing opposers to a just honorable federal government. the assembly have made an adjournment to the last monday in december next, in an expectation to hear the report from the respective towns. mr. hazard, a col. john gardener (who is entirely under the influence mr. hazard’s politics), are ordered by the assembly to go on from this state, take their seats in congress, as soon as they can leave home; so that in a short time you will have those two antis to deal with. i am, with sincere esteem, sir, your obedient humble serv’t, jeremiah olney. col. alexander hamilton. washington to hamilton. mount vernon, nov. 6, 1788. dear sir: the count de moustier affording a very favorable conveyance for capt. cochran’s watch, i have requested the favor him to take charge it; he will deliver it to you, accordingly, with mrs. washington’s my best wishes for you mrs. hamilton. i am, dear sir, your obedient affectionate serv’t, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. hamilton to sedgewick. new-york, nov. 9, 1788. your last letter one met me at albany, attending court, from whence i am but just returned. yours the 2d instant is this moment handed me. i am very sorry for the schism you hint at among the federalists, but i have so much confidence in the good management the fast friends the constitution, that i hope no ill consequences will ensue from that disagreement. it will, however, be worthy great care to avoid suffering a difference opinion on collateral points, to produce any serious division between those who have hitherto drawn together on the great national question. permit me to add, that i do not think you should allow any line to be run between those who wish to trust alterations to future experience, those who are desirous them at the present juncture. the rage for amendments is, in my _opinion_, rather to be parried by address than encountered with open force. i shall, therefore, be loth to learn that your parties have been arranged professedly upon the distinction i have mentioned. the _mode_ in which amendments may best be made, twenty other matters, may serve as pretexts for avoiding the evil securing the good. on the question between mr. h. mr. a., mr. king will probably have informed you that i have, upon the whole, concluded that the latter ought to be supported. my measures will be taken accordingly. i had but one scruple, but after mature consideration i have relinquished it. mr. adams, to a sound understanding, has always appeared to me to add an ardent love for the public good; as his further knowledge of the world seems to have corrected those jealousies which he is represented to have been once influenced by, i trust nothing of the kind suggested in my former letter will disturb the harmony of administration. let me continue to hear from you, believe me to be, with very great esteem regard, your friend servant, a. hamilton. t. sedgewick, esq. hamilton to washington. november 18, 1788. dear sir: your last two letters have duly come to hand, the count de moustier has delivered me the watch you committed to his charge. your obliging attention to this matter claims my particular acknowledgments. i will make no apology for asking you to take the additional trouble of forwarding the inclosed to the general. i take the liberty of passing it through you, that you may, by perusing the contents, know the situation of the business. the demand of fifty guineas is to me quite unexpected. i am sorry to add, that there is too good evidence that it cost a mere trifle to the general. this, however, i mention in confidence. nor shall i give you any further trouble on the subject. whatever may be proper will be done. mrs. hamilton requests her affectionate remembrances to mrs. washington, joins me in the best wishes for you both. i remain, dear sir, your affectionate humble serv’t, a. hamilton. p. s. your last letter, on a certain subject, i have received. i feel a conviction that you will finally see your acceptance to be indispensable. it is no compliment to say, that no other man can sufficiently unite the public opinion, can give the requisite weight to the office, in the commencement of the government. these considerations appear to me of themselves decisive. i am not sure that your refusal would not throw every thing into confusion. i am sure that it would have the worst effect imaginable. indeed, as i hinted in a former letter, i think circumstances leave no option. hamilton to madison. new-york, nov. 23, 1788. i thank you, my dear sir, for yours of the 20th. the only part of it which surprises me, is what you mention respecting clinton. i cannot, however, believe that the plan will succeed. nor, indeed, do i think, that clinton would be disposed to exchange his present appointment for that office, risk his popularity by holding both. at the same time, the attempt merits attention, ought not to be neglected as chimerical impracticable. in massachusetts the electors will, i understand, be appointed by the legislature, will be all federal, ’tis probable will be, for the most part, in favor of adams. it is said, the same thing will happen in new hampshire, i have reason to believe, will be the case in connecticut. in this state it is difficult to form any certain calculation. a large majority of the _assembly_ was doubtless of an anti-federal complexion, but the schism in the party which has been occasioned by the falling off of some of its leaders in the convention, leaves me not without hope, that if matters are well managed, we may procure a majority for some pretty equal compromise. in the senate we have the superiority by one. in new jersey there seems to be no question, but that the complexion of the electors will be federal; i suppose, if thought expedient, they may be united in favor of adams. pennsylvania you can best judge of. from delaware, maryland, south carolina, i presume, we may count with tolerable assurance on federal men; i should imagine, if pains are taken, the danger of an anti-federal vice-president might itself be rendered the instrument of union. at any rate, their weight will not be thrown into the scale of clinton, i do not see from what quarter numbers can be marshalled in his favor, equal to those who will advocate adams, supposing even a division in the federal votes. on the whole, i have concluded to support adams, though i am not without apprehensions on the score we have conversed about. my principal reasons are these: first--he is a declared partisan of deferring to future experience the expediency of amendments in the system, (although i do not altogether _adopt_ this sentiment) it is much nearer my own than certain other doctrines. secondly--he is certainly a character of importance in the eastern states; if he is not vice-president, one of two worse things will be likely to happen. either he must be nominated to some important office, for which he is less proper, will become a malcontent, give additional weight to the opposition to the government. as to knox, i cannot persuade myself that he will incline to the appointment. he must _sacrifice_ emolument by it, which must be of _necessity_ a primary object with him. if it should be thought expedient to endeavor to unite in a particular character, there is a danger of a different kind to which we must not be inattentive--the possibility of rendering it doubtful who is appointed president. you know the constitution has not provided the means of distinguishing in certain cases, it would be disagreeable even to have a man treading close upon the heels of the person we wish as president. may not the malignity of the opposition be, in some instances, exhibited even against him? of all this we shall best judge, when we know who are our electors; we must, in our different circles, take our measures accordingly. i could console myself for what you mention respecting yourself, from a desire to see you in one of the executive departments, did i not perceive the representation will be defective in characters of a certain description. wilson is evidently out of the question. king tells me he does not believe he will be elected into either house. mr. gouverneur morris set out to-day for france, by way of philadelphia. if you are not in one of the branches, the government may sincerely feel the want of men who unite to zeal all the requisite qualifications for parrying the machinations of its enemies. might i advise, it would be, that you bent your course to virginia. affectionately yours, a. hamilton. mr. j. madison. washington to hamilton. monday morning, january 4, 1789. dear sir: i feel myself very much obliged by what you sent me yesterday. the letter from governor johnston i return, much pleased to find so authentic an account of the adoption by north carolina of the constitution. yours, sincerely affectionately, g. washington. hamilton to sedgewick. new-york, jan. 29, 1789. my dear sir: i thank you for your two letters of the 4th 7th instant, which arrived here during my absence at albany, from which place i have but recently returned. i believe you may be perfectly tranquil on the subject of mr. adams’s election. it seems to be certain that all the middle states will vote for him to delaware inclusively, probably maryland. in the south, there are no candidates thought of but rutledge clinton. the latter will have the votes of virginia, it is _possible_ some in south carolina. maryland will certainly not vote for clinton, new-york, from our legislature having by their contentions let slip the day, will not vote at all. for the last circumstance, i am not sorry, as the most we could hope would be to balance accounts do no harm. the anti-federalists incline to an appointment notwithstanding, but i discourage it with the federalists. under these circumstances, i see not how any person can come near mr. adams; that is, taking it for granted that he will unite the votes in new hampshire massachusetts. i expect that the federal votes in virginia, if any, will be in favor of adams. you will probably have heard that our legislature has passed a bill for electing representatives. the houses continue to disagree about senators, i fear a compromise will be impracticable. i do not, however, entirely lose hope. in this situation, you will perceive that we have much to apprehend respecting the seat of government. the pennsylvanians are endeavoring to bring their forces early in the field. i hope our friends in the north will not be behindhand. on many accounts, indeed, it appears to be important that there be an appearance of zeal punctuality in coming forward to set the government in motion. i shall learn with infinite pleasure that you are a representative. as to me, this will not be the case--i believe, from my own disinclination to the thing. we shall, however, i flatter myself, have a couple of federalists. i remain your affectionate obedient, a. hamilton. wadsworth to hamilton. hartford, february, 1789. my dear sir: your favor of the 25th january came in good time. our votes were given agreeably to your wishes--washington, 7; adams, 5; governor huntington, 2. by letters from carrington, i learn that clinton is the anti-federal vice-president; but i think we have nothing to fear. i believe new hampshire will give adams 4; massachusetts, 6; georgia, 6--as letters from georgia say he will have at least so many--which, with ours, makes 21, which is more than clinton can get, we may certainly reckon on three more for adams in south carolina, maryland, delaware, pennsylvania, new jersey. we waived an answer to your state, to virginia. as you did not get my letter in season to answer me on that subject, i feared we should not do any good by an answer; as the anti-federalists did not move it, i thought we had best let it sleep. * * * i am, dear sir, your affectionate friend, jeremiah wadsworth. end of vol. i. transcriber’s notes a number of typographical errors were corrected silently.

support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs. the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states. u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff. please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. to donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. section 5. general
