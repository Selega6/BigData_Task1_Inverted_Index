cruise u. s. schooner dolphin. ---------- year 1824, crew whale ship, called globe, belonging island nantucket, mutinied while pacific ocean, murdered officers latitude about eight degrees south, longitude one hundred sixty degrees west, carried ship mulgrave islands, proposed chief mutineers burn her, form settlement. here landed great part stores, sails, rigging, &c.; some crew, who part mutiny, taking advantage others' shore, cut cables, just dusk evening, and, making sail, stood out sea fine breeze. mutineers pursued ship, soon discovered underway, but, finding outsailed them, soon gave up chase, returned shore. nautical instruments every description taken shore order mutineers, people board globe left traverse vast ocean, studded islands, rocks, reefs, currents frequent, strong, variable, without any other guide which direct course than stars prevailing winds. mulgrave islands situated north latitude six degrees, east longitude one hundred seventy. three degrees; although passage globe very long, arrived safely valparaiso, crew informed american consul events transpired. unfortunately period commerce, coast pacific, required protection all naval force time station, measures taken bring offenders answer crimes, until some months after globe returned united states. information occurrence communicated secretary navy, he, 1825, directed commodore hull, then commanding squadron pacific ocean, despatch united states schooner dolphin, search such mutineers left mulgraves. besides importance bringing guilty punishment, sake example,--humanity suffering condition innocent, left who escaped, dictated something done relief. accordingly 18th august, 1825, dolphin sailed chorillos, coast peru, under command lieutenant percival, who directed, preparatory departure coast, stop some convenient place such refreshments necessary cruise. day following, stood into harbour casma, anchored, fired several guns, signals, acquaint people interior arrival stranger wanted aid. not long before satisfaction seeing number people, who made appearance obedience signal. few moments' conversation them, satisfied wants not supplied here. wood obtained, water neither good, nor convenient got at, all other things want of, only procured most extravagant prices. after laying anchor few hours, got underway, stood along coast small place called santa, which situated few leagues north us, casma poor harbour, lies much exposed prevailing southerly winds, frequently high dangerous surf breaks upon part shore alone (at any time) practicable land. valley, covered thickets reeds bushes, extends back sea several miles. there neither habitations nor inhabitants, sandy waste hill dale separates little indian village casma, which several miles interior. situated valley, about league circumference, which watered small stream. soil rich, poorly cultivated. inhabitants (of whom there about thousand) all indians. live wretched habitations, intercourse spaniards centuries, seems, not much improved condition any respect. principal dependance upon sale poultry such ships visit harbour trade interior country, people thus engaged, proximity sometimes very great convenience. harbour santa formed several small islands, lying little south it, about mile main. passed between islands main, although night, very dark. following morning, made customary signal, firing gun, which, very short time, brought captain port down beach. not much appearance official dignity, long black beard, respect prepossessing. rude, however, exterior, profuse offers hospitality. assured abundantly supplied every thing wanted, requested officer sent him santa, negociate supplies. purser myself ordered upon service, not time send santa horses, six miles anchorage, reduced necessity most painful ride, behind captain port companion whom brought him. road over uninterrupted plain, which almost everywhere covered impenetrable thickets reeds, algaroba[1], some places foot two deep water escaped streams cultivated valley. arrived door commandant's house, shewed air some formality, welcomed every spanish expression hospitality. appearance house corresponded well occupant. disgusting extreme. there two rooms it, one which occupied granary bed-room, other pulparia,[2] ordinary conveniences family. middle latter, hung hog, weighing three four hundred pounds, which butchered morning. captain pretended himself supply whatever asked for, assuring sell more cheaply than any one else, evinced extreme jealousy conversing any other than himself upon subject visit santa. matter courtesy, soon made way house governor, paid respects him. seemed feel highly complimented attention, and, like captain port, proffered assistance obtain whatever stood need of. bore name cruel conqueror peru, nothing less than great pizarro; evident, complexion curling locks, ancestors came africa. notwithstanding disadvantage, however, not compared captain port without disparagement, and, considering wretched society which lived, thought discharged official duties rather creditably. both governor captain port invited dine them; each, fearing make purchase other, solicited company very earnestly. finally accepted invitation latter, escorted back house, table already smoking savoury dishes, served up variety ways huge animal seen there morning, under circumstances means calculated improve appetites. rabble, formed half naked indians, long bearded white men, assembled room, while dinner, some whom sat down table unceremoniously, partook us. host indulged himself freely use aquadiente,[3] and, ere finished repast, house exhibited constant scene riot, which exceedingly glad escape. after making few purchases returned board. next day, party, consisting about thirty forty, came down make visit. all degrees society santa, without any distinction,--whites, mulattoes, indians, having, seem, mingled together occasion. remained all day, eating drinking, appeared very happy; begged every thing came way. sunset, great satisfaction, left us, following morning, got underway, continued along coast north. small town santa contains about two thousand inhabitants, nearly all whom indians. situated latitude nine degrees south, valley santa, which twenty thirty miles circumference, beautiful rich soil, watered deep rapid stream, which takes rise andes, distance hundred miles sea coast. previous revolution, flourishing valley, numerous population, producing rice, wheat, other grain, considerable quantities, exportation; frequently large herds cattle driven lima. abounds also fruits, such oranges, lemons, grapes, variety other delicious kinds. large farming establishments every seen, each comprehending thousands acres, previous revolution possessed gentlemen ample fortune. all are, now ruins, most unoccupied. climate santa mild, almost unvarying. here, nearly all rest peru, bordering pacific ocean, never rains, wherever land cultivated watered rivers. around cultivated valley santa, spread extensive plains barren sand; short distance back sea rises first range gloomy sterile mountains which, increasing altitude advance into interior, terminates eternal snow-covered andes, distance fifty hundred miles. santa obtained wood ease, two three old wells, near shore, filled casks brackish water. river empties into harbour much exposed sea render watering difficult, almost always dangerous. santa place some trade before revolution, connected direct communication some mines precious metals interior. 24th august, anchored roads huanchaco, communicated several vessels lying there. huanchaco indian village, seaport city bolivia, ancient name which truxillo. exposed sea, times surf breaks violently shore, prevent all intercourse vessels anchor. indians provided float call balsa, which pass through surf, cases great emergency, boat live it. composed merely two bundles long reeds, bound compactly together, tapering little one end, two bundles secured each other, small ends coming point, somewhat resembling appearance bow boat. middle hollowed sufficiently man seat himself securely. usually about fifteen feet long, two three feet wide. calculated one man only, who directs paddle. one day witnessed wonderful skill management balsa. surf breaking furiously, men, accustomed work it, advised not go board ship. whilst standing shore, several around me, boat appeared just without heavy rollers setting in, filled people, who evident strangers danger about encounter, dashing fearlessly into surf. indians near made motions, called not advance further, neither saw nor heard warning. observing this, six eight launched balsas, few minutes midst breakers. just time, boat moment afterwards darted forward great velocity, suddenly disappeared. wave broken, foaming over her, another terminated existence every person board; but, before next swell, came rolling quick succession reached them, each man upon balsa, skilful intrepid indians bore safely shore. remained few hours huanchaco, continued north, 25th august, came up lobos islands, latitude six degrees south, distant about hundred miles coast. barren rocks, rising some places several hundred feet, any appearance vegetation. aid glasses, saw distance number people upon inhospitable rocks, supposing some unfortunate seamen, whose vessel cast away, hove to, view affording relief. upon examination, however, proved indians coast, who come here catamaran, upon fishing enterprise, season great quantities fish, resembling mackerel, taken shores islands. previous ascertaining who fishermen were, landed small island nearer us, where, side hill, forty fifty yards distant, saw several hundreds seals basking sun. rock rose perhaps hundred feet, many seals near top it. noise landing gave alarm, and, cut off water, made best way other side hill, joining terrific growl like many furious mastiffs. reached top hill, descending opposite side, overtook them, very wantonly killed several. large many weighed least five six hundred pounds, motions extremely clumsy. whenever came near growl, snapped like ferocious dog, long teeth warned not approach within striking distance. considering immense size, astonishing bow slight blow kill given nose. if, however, fatal part missed, receive severe blow upon any other part head, suffer little injury, become extremely tenacious life, particularly time swell. nose then longer mortal part, almost impossible subdue them. witnessed several instances kind, poorly provided weapons proper purpose, withal unskilled use them. descending top hill, there one narrow defile which escape, there floundered nearly half hour, tumbling over each other three four deep, until last got into native element. north side lobos islands affords fine harbour, saw small vessel anchor waiting proceeds cargo, which landed coast place called lambayaca. 26th august, anchored peyta, latitude five degrees south. last place which convenient stop, here, gratification, enabled obtain necessary refreshments cruise. filled deck pigs, poultry, vegetables, considerable expense succeeded, after much trouble, obtaining supply good water. peyta situated deep bay, good harbour, formed two projecting points land, many leagues surrounded barren sand. seaport interior city, called pieura, receives distant valleys all necessary consumption inhabitants strangers, who visit purposes trade. supplied water river empties itself into sea, near small indian town called golan, whence found necessary resort supply. proceeded there, anchored vessel within mile two town, only method which obtain water, brought calabashes mules. saint's day, village all frolic mirth. groups men women everywhere seen, dressed fantastically, singing dancing along streets. called upon governor, who white man, very early morning, report arrival vessel, object visit. just risen hammock, received many expressions civility, proffers assistance. house little better than captain port santa, appearance not more prepossessing. room into which ushered other floor than ground beaten hard, which several large piles pumpkins, bags beans, indian corn, which proposed sell before official interview ended. immediately after breakfast came board visit captain, bringing him several emales. remained board nearly all day, annoyance every body, evening removed shore great difficulty, freely partaken hospitality. soon after arrival peyta, invited dine governor, who treated great kindness hospitality. some months previous arrival, son shipped himself talcahuana, board dolphin, common sailor, discharged arrival here, permitted remain friends. spoken amongst person who compelled fly home improper conduct some kind, now whole mystery explained. father one most respectable patriotic men place resided; son youth bad disposition, given him great deal trouble. revolution first commenced section country, provided himself uniform patriot officer, went about country, stranger, slightly known, under authority pretended commission, took, violence, cattle horses farmers, whatever else possess himself of, which converted into money own purposes. sometimes even pressed indians soldiers, compelled assist him carrying off plunder. length, exactions became heavy, levied tyrannically, gentleman resisted him, questioned legality authority. numbers fired indignation against him, propriety conduct sooner questioned, than investigation followed up such activity, that, finding there safety flight, preferred voluntary exile meeting just resentment people injured. suffered many hardships during absence, appeared return truly penitent. father's house entered. mother sisters deeply affected, received him all tenderness female sympathy, eyes overflowing tears. each embraced him, one most dear them; approached father (a man about sixty) who standing opposite side room, caught old man's eye bent indignantly upon him, turned away look humbled dust. whilst lying here opportunity witnessing solitary instance enterprising disposition peruvian indian,--a characteristic, believed, rarely possess, or, most, slight degree. board indian youth, who belonged part peru, several days held frequent conversations countrymen, who attracted board curiosity. one people concerted youth plan deserting. compliance arrangement, put off, during mid-watch, canoe, taking station just ahead dolphin, gave shrill whistle signal approach. lad, fearing detected, not venture answer signal, which repeated several times, officer watch suspecting object, gave long expected response, credulous indian came cautiously paddling close under bow vessel, where, amazement, made prisoner, compelled go board. captain came deck next morning, punished poor indian, impressing upon him belief intended detain, make soldier him. not sagacity enough know difference between vessel patriot man-of-war, conceiving there chance escape, made most pathetic appeals captain's humanity, appeared suffer all agony despair. captain ordered cartridge-box put over shoulders, musket placed hands. seemed frantic reality servitude, using utmost violence disengage himself cartridge-box musket, declaring again again soldier, most affecting manner begging captain god's sake permit him go shore. tormentors discontinued persecutions, jumped over stern into canoe, great activity, soon joined anxious friends beach, who assembled there, apprehensive captivity, awaiting result. 2d september, sailed peyta, shaped course gallapagos islands. trade wind moderate, accompanied fine weather. morning 6th, made hood's island, few hours afterwards, anchored west side, small harbour, called gardner's bay, only one affords. after dinner, captain took him twenty thirty crew, went pursuit turtle. island high mountainous, covered everywhere volcanic cinders, many which huge masses. men first very eager search turtle, whole crew, permitted, gladly engaged it. expected found turtle near shore; instead which scramble over rocks climb mountains, half time making way through brambles, expense scratches torn clothes. men never more disappointed than crew amusement catching turtle. sometimes wander about hours before found one, then probably mile two beach, much man well lift. sundown collected about thirty, large size. black grouper very abundant close anchorage, sharks numerous every fish taken lost one two hooks. got plentiful supply crew, however, course hour. following morning, joined captain meek, brig tamahamah, which vessel accompanied hither, making large party--went round island about ten twelve miles anchorage, expected find turtle more abundant. captain old cruiser here, well calculated make one agreeable party. stood cook us, day very warm, first essay landing, make large bower, under which prepare dinner. people then dispersed, look turtle, first which served up dinner, style relished less keen appetites than ours, which sharpened laborious exercise. night, collected upwards hundred, besides ten large green turtle, fortunate find beach near place landing. came assemble men return board, two missing, upon inquiry ascertained absent nearly all day. dispersed looked every direction until dark, every body much fatigued, party left search again morning, rest repaired board. morning, renewed labours without success, great reason began feel seriously alarmed safety shipmates. there water island, preceding day extremely warm, feared poor fellows soon perish, not already. search, too, attended considerable danger. wandering about distant parts island, sometimes, clambering over rocks mountains, changed course without sensible it, find ourselves pursuing way different direction supposed. afternoon, strength patience quite exhausted, parties returning night, lost men suddenly appeared beach, close vessel. pale emaciated, scarcely strength move one foot before other. clothes tatters, shoes worn off feet, which very much crippled long journey over sharp cinders. appeared story men, several times side island anchored, upon eminence overlooked vessel, thinking themselves other side, recrossed; when, astonishment, seeing nothing her, retrace steps; manner, wandering about many hours, almost despairing last finding relief. while wretched situation, several times quenched thirst killing turtle came way, drinking reservoir which nature supplied singular animal. since told seaman, deserted whale ship islands, accompanied number others, weeks, other water than obtained breaking open turtles drinking water found them. contained pouch resembles bladder, immediately connected stomach. large proportion size animal, some hold two three gallons. surprised see tameness birds. scarcely fly approached within few feet, many instances pick up hands. gannet, generally clear white, large goose, catch great ease; albatrosses, some grey some yellow, which much larger than any bird united states, rarely rise upon wing escape us. ran very fast, sometimes give chase one two hundred yards. bird, plumage form which differed respect mocking-bird, feed within few feet us, turtle-doves killed great numbers people, short poles. hood's island evidently volcanic origin. is, indeed, nothing mass cinders. covered slight growth scrubby bushes various kinds, occasionally tree four five inches diameter, met with. all vegetation, cactus seems best adapted it. there variety species; one which attains larger size than any other production island, spreads out into tree considerable height. kind cactus chosen turtle food. whalers, other visiters, go gallapagos islands animals, cut down number trees evening, following morning sure find turtle feeding there, although none seen vicinity preceding day. guanas not least remarkable inhabitants gallapagos. two three feet long shaped like lizard. colour varies grey jet black. easily caught quite harmless; often eaten said excellent. top head beautiful shining crest black yellow, which, sun, most brilliant appearance. except anchored, heavy surf breaks all round hood's island. high central part it, place which resembles dry bed small lake. surrounded ridges peaks cinders rising some places one three hundred feet, all probability crater volcano. places difficult access saw few seals, shy exception one two instances, not approach them. few killed hair seal, consequently little value. between hood's island small one forms harbour, there passage ships, very narrow, strong current runs through it, which always render dangerous ship attempt pass, particularly wind not perfectly fair. one, p.m., 10th september, got underway, stood over charles island, anchored six, essex bay. rock dismal, called commodore porter, excellent land mark, seems appropriately named. rises eastward essex bay, sharp crags fifty hundred feet high. few solitary bushes constitute all vegetation. approaching essex bay, entrance, alarmed several times strong ripple, casting lead found bottom ten fathoms line. essex bay, celebrated post-office whalers, which commodore porter resorted several times during cruise information. found letter there left whaler who visited charles island supply turtle. last river tumbez, one crew caught fever, which died. two others lost way mountains charles island, where, after wandering about considerable time, one complained companion head-ache, soon after sat down died. other found way ship after great deal suffering. charles island high mountainous, like hood's, covered thin growth bushes. distance mile beach there small spring water, which there footpath over crags hills, worn visiters search turtle, scanty supply which only obtained great labour. residence pat, irishman, lone dreary place, number years, made object curiosity all who visit island. here planted potatoes pumpkins, raised chickens; administering government island despotic sway, pat monarch although pillowed head upon rock, reposed rude limbs bed made bushes. story known all who read commodore porter's journal, which gives account pat's residence island, possessing himself person services black man belonging whale ship, who strayed too far companions, whom pat held durance long time. ten, a.m., parted company tamahamah, sailed marqueses islands. turtle which deck covered, very troublesome offensive about week, became quite domesticated gave not slightest inconvenience. two three weeks served crew constantly, lieu usual allowance salt provisions. most valuable substitute, important us, bound upon long cruise, well health crew preservation sea stock. number became comparatively small, discontinued general use them, served only once twice week. never fed them, aught see, equally fat healthy month after taken board, first day. sea stock nothing more convenient better calculated long cruise. put any kept almost any way, thought advisable feed them, there scarcely any vegetable substance not eat after little domesticated. liver turtle particularly delicious. fried, not unlike fine oyster, although partaken very freely of, ill effect ever experienced it. sixteen days after leaving charles island, made island rooahooga, one southernmost marqueses group. wind fresh blew steadily southward eastward, accompanied heavy swell. approached islands, some rainy cloudy weather, exception, whole passage attended clear days fine moonlight nights. latitude three degrees south, longitude ninety-five degrees west, observed remarkable appearance water, which, navigating unfrequented ocean, very much alarmed us. several different times during day, september 12th, passed through violent rips, times nearly whole ocean assumed appearance agitation boiling water. throughout passage, remarked, whenever wind hauled southward southeast, increased force. occurred frequently subject general remark. 20th september, latitude seven degrees fifty minutes south, longitude one hundred twenty degrees thirty minutes west, saw comet first time, thirty forty degrees above horizon, bearing east north. day-light, morning september 26th, several southernmost marqueses sight. all mountainous, covered vegetation, drew near presented pleasing contrast sterile gloomy gallapagos. stood along shore la dominica, admiring beautiful little valleys presented view quick succession, villages palm-thatched huts, surrounded clumps tall cocoa-nut wide-spreading bread fruit trees, formed scenes rural quiet calculated fill imagination most agreeable conceptions happy condition inhabitants. length came small bay valley more populous than any seen before, captain, great satisfaction, hauled up stood close towards island. lowered boat, providing ourselves few trifles presents, pulled into bay within few yards shore. beach already thronged people all ages, male female, who invited land most significant gestures, whilst many singing dancing express joy. surrounding rocks hills covered groups females, gaily decked off neat head-dresses white tapa cloth many-coloured robes, which floating wind, half concealing half exposing fantastically painted limbs. saw not land, men boys dashed into water whatever offer us, swam off boat. chief, who dry wreath cocoa-nut around brows, came off them; and, upon invited, got into boat, remained until departure, apparently giving orders time time who passing repassing shore boat. few minutes, presented considerable quantity cocoa-nuts, bananas, papayas, which gave return few trifling articles, most valuable which glass beads. chief eyes constantly fixed upon fire-arms, finally gave understand, motions, pistol acceptable him. intimation not comply; bore refusal great good nature, some time after store little presents exhausted, people continued bring off fruit without expectation any return. found serious refusal land, women came hills assembled rocks close us, where, nearer view, display persons more advantage, charm melody voices. there all joined songs, keeping time clapping hands, stopping occasionally receive applause men invite shore. several them, male female, swam off boat; about depart, insisted strongly upon going board use some violence get clear them. continued afternoon, soon passing la dominica, sundown made rooahooga ahead. weather squally island only fifteen miles us, lay night. daylight, found ourselves few miles distant middle south side island, bay presented itself, which, distance, promised afford anchorage. nearer approach, however, appearance changed, there few signs inhabitants, ran along toward west end island. part not much appearance fertility, although saw few large trees. high, broken, indented number small bays, none which large enough form harbour. rounding southwest point island sudden violent gusts wind. invisible bay situated little westward point, although somewhat appearance harbour, presents view beautiful sand beach, saw indications inhabitants. about ten miles north, anchored twenty fathoms water, rocky bottom, inaccessible rocky shore surf breaks violently. captain several officers went back invisible bay one boats, cave close shore found five six natives, who approach, fled hills, making signs people depart. cave, found few fishing-nets. tried prevail upon natives come near, demonstrations friendship answered only motions expressive hostility. landing difficult, shore rocky, considerable surf broke upon it, although bay tolerably protected projecting point. soon after meridian, got under way shaped course nooaheeva, which plainly sight rooahooga. stood along, fine breeze clear weather, three, p.m., rounded north-eastern extremity nooaheeva, spacious harbour, called comptroller's bay, opened view. about three miles deep, inner extremity two projecting points extend out more than mile, form three small harbours. sooner observed natives shore, than put off number large canoes pulled great rapidity towards us. wind light baffling, advanced slowly into harbour. few minutes, surrounded canoes, containing six eight men each. belonged different tribes, which attempted explain great earnestness speech gesture, one board who knew much language, greatly loss comprehend meaning. not followed long two canoes came along side, one each quarter, men crawled up side perched themselves upon hammocks, like many monkeys, called out loud voice, addressing themselves alternately natives side vessel opposite them,--one party exclaiming "mattee, mattee, typee!" other "mattee, mattee,[4] happah!" occasionally using angry gestures exclamation. too expressive not understand. belonged different tribes, typee, happah; mutually trying prejudice against tribe which not belong, order induce anchor own bay. both bays beautiful, happahs' most populous nearest us, gave preference; little before sunset anchored twenty fathoms water within cable's length shore. typees sooner saw standing happah bay, than hurried into canoe paddled off village fast could. happah valley romantic spot. plain, league two circumference, stretched back mountains semicircular form, presenting front clear white sand beach about mile long. plain covered cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit interspersed, near enough form continued shade without presenting appearance dense forest. scattered about every through trees palm-thatched habitations natives. rear plain, mountains rose precipitously, forming insuperable barrier against incursions other tribes. land rose gently left, almost barren added nothing beauty landscape. extreme right, considerable mountain point projecting far out into bay, separated happahs tribes lived beyond direction. nothing equal apparent joy natives saw anchored front village. whole tribe, which probably not exceed five hundred, flocked down beach, expressing satisfaction dancing singing. hundreds dashed into water swam off us, not time furl sails clear deck before vessel crowded people. show means making successful resistance against any hostile intention adopt, paraded musketeers upon deck practised them, ceremony appeared afford natives very great amusement. allowed remain board until dusk evening, number great make vessel uncomfortable, apprehending course night appropriate themselves many things find about deck, which not conveniently spared, sent most shore. chiefs few others who expressed great desire remain, permitted pass night us. following day, took few presents went over typee valley, visit tribe, celebrated most warlike nooaheeva. soon boat perceived, people came running towards beach every direction, before reached shore surrounded great numbers, who plunged into water swam off us. many conveniently accommodate permitted get into boat, treated unceremoniously not think prudent land. amongst who paid visit chief tribe. man about thirty years age, well-featured fine proportions. deportment grave dignified, like rest new acquaintances, who swam off us, quite naked except slight covering about loins. common people treated him great deference, never intruded upon part boat seated. made understand wished obtain muskets powder, purchase which caused five six large hogs brought down, tied laying shore. offered him whatever else thought induce him part them; obstinately refused any other consideration than muskets powder. large quantities cocoa-nuts, bananas, papayas thrown into boat people who swimming around us, lying there hour, many boat conveniently carry. variety presents, such beads, buttons, &c., all which common people very anxious obtain; chief take nothing less consequence than fire-arms gunpowder. offered him flints musket balls, which, although great value amongst natives, not receive. invited frequently, great earnestness manner, land, until found, repeated refusals, determined remain boat. bay typees rather smaller than happah tribe. live principally upon side mountain rises gently shore. number tribe appeared about same happahs. houses situated circular chains villages, rising one above other, base near top mountain, terminates rude uninhabitable cliffs. groves clumps cocoa-nut, bread-fruit trees every interspersed dwellings, mind observer impressed idea usefulness natives, gives double effect beautiful landscape adorned waving tops broad green leaves. several occasions remark inveterate dislike typees happahs entertained towards each other. morning after arrival, sailing-master went shore happah valley obtain altitude sun artificial horizon shy natives, all first, apprehending some approach him hostile intention, while back turned towards them, heard held great reverence place said tabooed, consecrated, made circle round place observation, told natives, who followed him great numbers, space within circle tabooed. stared him silence stood back it; by, intently engaged getting altitude, one natives, supposing employed some plan (to him incomprehensible) destroy typees, turned face sextant direction, crawled up gently behind sailing-master, without perceived him, suddenly tapping him two three times shoulder, exclaimed great energy, "mattee, mattee, typee!" readily supposed imagination, which very much excited before, not soothed salutation. turned upon native, expressing look manner consternation displeasure, which only met delighted indian repetition "mattee, mattee, typee!" morning 25th, went shore, company several officers, indulge curiosity ramble about valley. soon surrounded group natives, who followed wherever went. first object visit chief valley, whose residence found distance two three hundred yards shore. plain, oblong hut, thirty twenty feet. simple structure such first suggested untutored mind--a few poles laid over crotches, upon which framed triangular roof, whole thatched palm cocoa-nut leaves. entered regal hut found chief seated near one end it, who barely condescended notice approached make salutations. not prepared rude reception felt somewhat mortified find chief distinguished rank totally destitute courtesy. thought least risen sitting posture, expected more him than after experience taught right look people state nature. only furniture hut few coarse mats. one side five muskets, highly polished, arranged one above other, over which hung two kegs powder sewed up canvass, near few long spears war conch, ornamented human hair. made ourselves much home received more cordial welcome, indulged curiosity examining whatever saw, suddenly chief rose silence gravity once explained. remarked uncommonly large black robe thrown over him, without least suspicion covered any one else than himself. suddenly threw aside came near him there stood wife, girl about eighteen years age, who just finished making toilet. pointed look satisfaction, uttered "motake," word afterwards learned, signified very good, very well. although naturally pretty girl, made herself hideous looking object. smeared face all over coarse yellow paint, upon which drawn streaks black green, than which nothing appeared more disgusting. assumed manner look affectation, such often observed some self-approving beauty, who, conscious charms, feels object admiration all around her. expressed disapprobation style ornament, stared look surprise, which seemed ask saying. soon gave both chief understand, signs; after which seemed not well pleased themselves each other; saw again evening without any ornament, looked all better it. while here, two grotesque figures came walked up austere look. profusion cock's feathers bound circularly round brows, broad gorgets wood ornamented red berries round necks, shell bracelets ornaments polished shell bone tied above ancles. each held hand fan palmetto. after standing few moments, keeping eyes fixed upon me, began jumping up down fanning themselves, applying both hands fan. first feeling surprise, mingled curiosity, know cause strange appearance; several times repeated exercise, scene altogether ridiculous not refrain laughing. soon afterwards, without even noticing chief, turned walked off. after leaving hut chief, visited number others, all which nearly alike. one saw two drums, only instruments music met with. largest hollow log, three four feet long, about foot half diameter, covered both ends shark skin. asked owner play upon it, which readily consented, seeming highly flattered invitation. accompanied voice thumping hands elbows drum-head; music made intolerable. beat, however, very good time, evidently high opinion performance. course ramble, one officers told indian, who joined us, signs, wanted some cocoa-nuts. good-natured fellow acquiesced without least hesitation, great astonishment, ran up tree standing near us, activity squirrel. tree forty fifty feet high, slight inclination, yet climbing seemed occasion him scarcely any exertion. not press bodies against tree hitch themselves up customary us, which, naked condition, not without injury. press bottoms feet against tree, clinging hands one above other, ascend upon all-fours. not strike less surprise thrown cocoa-nuts down, see facility stripped off hard husks without aid any thing teeth. such thing accomplished one found impossible. afterwards remarked same practise other places, other islands. general except old men, who, unless very robust, used sharp-pointed stick hard wood remove husk. not understand practice shaking hands. extended hand one mark friendly salutation, looked though question meant it; manner seemed think object feel skin, which always reciprocate raising up sleeves examining very minutely. morning 29th september, which last remaining comptroller's bay, made another excursion typee bay, taking chief happahs, who very anxious go. wondered this, tribes evinced much dislike each other; afterwards saw, intercourse natives south sea islands, uncivilized men capable much duplicity towards each other educated refined. arrived within hundred yards shore met chief whom formed acquaintance preceding day. saluted chief happahs way indicated former acquaintance, look manner somewhat formal. typee chief immediately spoke some one near him, who ran off few minutes returned calabash filled preparation bread-fruit, upon which poured quantity milk expressed cocoa-nut. offered typee happah chief, also invited partake it. tasted found very palatable. two chiefs seated themselves stern boat, made hearty breakfast, using fingers instead spoons. neither seemed very communicative, only few words passed between interview. there also boat young woman belonging chief's family, whom breakfast brought shell cocoa-nut, which preparation cocoa-nut bread-fruit, sour disagreeable taste. this, informed, food upon which women almost entirely subsist, tabooed eating whatever held high estimation men. chiefs finished repast, typee pointed hogs, which again caused brought down upon beach, saying wanted powder guns them, unfortunately neither valuable articles which make exchange him, consider nothing else equivalent. sent several old muskets very much out order, proposed go board repaired, making understand signs, return present hogs. anxiety great upon subject, found difficult put stop solicitations. mean time, however, saw schooner underway, dismissing typee friends, pulled away happah bay. approached within half mile happah village, schooner almost out harbour, chief observing anxious get board, proposed jumping into water swimming home, which readily consented. then stripped himself neck ear ornaments, which consisted two white pieces polished shell carved image bone, presenting token regard, plunged into water, leaving free pursue way vessel without trouble landing him. most ornaments worn people, bone shells, finely polished rudely carved. attach number piece cocoa-nut twine, wear around necks, wrists, ancles, most agreeable taste fancy individuals. more expensive difficult ornament obtain gorget. piece wood, semi-circular, about three inches wide, carved fit neck, covered beautiful red black berry, stuck gum oozes tree bread-fruit. hill rises left valley, planted variety seeds fruit, vegetables grain,

day night. 30th september, stood out comptroller's bay, ran down massachusetts' bay, place made familiar countrymen commodore porter's long interesting visit. two points form harbours comptroller's massachusetts' bays, about seven miles distant each other. one, p.m., clear projecting southern point comptroller's bay, three, p.m., anchored eight fathoms water, within half mile hill bottom bay, called porter's monument. before came anchor, water covered canoes, people both sexes all ages swimming towards us, soon vessel lost head way, crawling up all sides like many rats. not less delighted arrival than happahs. hundreds collected shore, all expressing satisfaction songs dances. amongst first visitors, two english sailors who deserted whale ships, long enough resident island converse language natives. came also native nooaheeva, native otaheite, both whom served considerable time whale ships, converse broken english. therefore want interpreters, seemed once introduce confidence friendship new acquaintances. harbour massachusetts' bay spacious affords good anchorage ships largest class. only part it, however, landing not attended difficulty some danger, east side, there fine sand beach quarter half mile long, one extremity which empties small rivulet pure excellent water into bay. landing effected watering-place beyond porter's monument, there more considerable stream fresh water, always difficult, surf high, cannot fail dangerous. place watered dolphin; swim casks shore, altogether, laborious undertaking. along east north part bay there long reef makes short distance shore, upon which heavy surf always breaking. entering bay, whole habitable part section island presented one view, forms most grand beautiful landscape. nearly semi-circular, rises like amphitheatre, fruitful populous circular ranges hills, until distance several miles, terminates circumference high gloomy mountains, tops which resemble massive wall. rude barren circle mountain contrasts finely fertile ranges below, covered forests cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees, huts villages every scattered about through hill dale. nor extreme elevation without interest beauty. number little cataracts reflecting rays sun looking like sheets liquid silver, break upon gloom sterile rock, adding brilliancy descend lively prospect below. after shower, not less than fifty splendid falls water seen, some which just perceptible through intervening space between hills trees, producing effect peculiarly agreeable. called porter's monument, round hill fifty hundred feet high, situated east extremity bay. here commodore porter fort, not vestige which now remaining. overrun wild luxuriant growth vines grass, trace footstep found. one side hill, near base, stretched bark line, which attended man who calls himself opotee, who declares hill beyond tabooed. upon one occasion, approaching it, some natives called out "taboo, taboo!" opotee immediately expressed willingness pass, countryman namesake, opotee. north porter's monument, back sand beach, navy-yard, all now overgrown bushes trees, some which attained considerable size. like monument, there indication ever occupied any human purpose, first october, day after arrival, went shore, taking great variety seeds, purpose planting most probable taken care come maturity. natives flocked round great numbers. there not less than hundred boys crowd men women followed me. highly delighted discovered object, which explained john luxon, native nooaheeva, who spoke english. whenever came rough muddy place, which frequently case, boys men, notwithstanding remonstrances, mount shoulders carry over, loud shouting. easily perceive frolic who engaged it, done out levity caprice moment; not feel first stimulated favourable impression conceived design. planted some things unfrequented places found clear spot, most seeds fruit-pits, enclosures natives. john luxon man some rank chief, possessed considerable property. one enclosures large seemed attended unusual care, devoted most attention. there, aided several natives, who laboured great assiduity, prepared ground made quite extensive plantation orange, lemon, cheromaya, peach, apricot, water-melons, pumpkins, potatoes, onions, beans, corn, variety other fruits grain, peru. expressed himself terms warmest gratitude, doubt natives already experienced most important benefits memento left dolphin's visit island. course days' occupation, several times driven into luxon's house frequent showers came over. sooner entered, than natives flocked after me, few minutes hut crowded. little boys girls here shewed same officious attention received making way village, expressed different manner. many approach surround fans, keeping going until rain ceased, again enabled resume work. kind civility, peculiarly agreeable, weather oppressively warm; not fail discover little attendants all candidates friendly notice bestowed civility expectation some reward. few trifles about me, not enough give all, felt loss way make presents, fearing least favoured mortified displeased. seemed however make difference. all "motake"[5] them. all seemed satisfied. return

groups dozen each, singing merrily clapping hands time music voices. little way men seated same manner similarly occupied. ladies, improve charms, used abundant quantity cocoa-nut oil, which filled air nauseous perfumes hundred yards round. many more highly anointed themselves yellow paint, which, cocoa-nut oil, running streams. some decorated themselves necklaces golden yellow fruit which bears strong resemblance pine-apple, emits powerful offensive smell. distance, variegated robes flying wind, appearance altogether agreeable, upon near approach scene animated beyond description. dusk evening signal dispersion, some went one way some another. second october, wandered back upon hills, all boys followed preceding day. renewed frolic carrying me, whenever seated myself, came round many approach, each green leaf fan. entered unceremoniously number huts, almost always found one more men, nearly every instance, extended backs, heads resting log laid along one side hut, heels another, about four feet first. never rise receive me, utter "motake," perceived them, make motions did, offering same time fan, one which using almost constantly. course ramble, met little girl, twelve fourteen years old, who very pretty, attended servant, only instance which remarked such thing island. evidently walking out make visit, just arrived house destination met her. put some beads round neck, which seemed delight very much; old man present, whose hut about visit, assumed angry look, seemed threaten manner. changed conduct, however, made him trifling present, little girl, taking hand, led father's hut. chief some consequence, indicated possession two three casks powder, six muskets. took down, displayed very ostentatiously, wanted know not others dispose of. conduct altogether kind hospitable, acknowledgment which made him present departure. whenever wanted cocoa-nuts quench thirst, only signify one men following about, supply nearest tree. one fellow very much amused. carried arms full cocoa-nuts following about nearly all day, returned vessel presented him musket ball, which perfectly satisfied, said "motake," went away. returned beach evening, found natives, male female, assembled great numbers day previous, amusing themselves same way. females again finest attire, distance any else mistaken assemblage fashionable belles. apprehensive men, number whom work shore, very much annoyed intrusion natives. this, however, not case. commenced work morning circle made, comprehending whole space wished occupy, which told natives tabooed, there not instance passing it. next day held quite fair beach. amongst other things, trade large quantities cocoa-nuts bread-fruit. former exchanged small pieces tobacco; piece iron hoop, fashioned into tool instrument husbandry, demanded latter. all day beach, cooking eating bread-fruit cocoa-nuts. evening, boys men amused playing soldiers, ranging themselves line sticks muskets. one officers took particular pleasure making grimaces, talking gibberish natives imitation manner speaking. very offensive them; respected too much betray displeasure. upon one occasion, however, amused himself way boys, about hundred whom assembled, encouraged retaliate him, clucking like hen. soon discovered disagreeable him, assembled round him like many little furies, clucking all might. seemed delight opportunity revenging themselves upon him, which most amply, not let him rest moment until went board, which soon afterwards, highly displeased conspiring indians against him. often amused strange ridiculous taste natives article dress. all desirous obtaining clothes, number old garments given them, exchanged curiosities officers crew. obtained, whether fitted not, indians immediately put on, scarcely ever more than one garment time. thus, half naked half attired, native walk about exceeding gravity, admiring himself, believing every one else equally pleased genteel appearance. whenever seated themselves sing, person selected occupy conspicuous station, perform dance round circle, slowly, most graceful native style, striking same time hollow left arm right hand, time music voices. distinction always conferred upon some one who obtained old jacket tattered shirt. jacket, sure buttoned closely round him, two three remaining buttons, sleeves, not torn off, probably not reach more than half length arms. thus attired, perform evolutions round circle slowly, most serious air, stopping occasionally receive applause singers, who bestowed upon him great enthusiasm. soon after daylight, one morning beach, curiosity led place, number females busily employed collecting something rocks. approached discontinued occupation, fled, called back, prevailed upon renew occupation. each provided green leaf, which gathering rocks species fine green sea moss small snails. preserved leaf intended families home. ate freely them, said "motake." moss tender, other taste than salt water, which covered high tide. snails not larger than pea, covered hard shell, broken, heated tongue like pepper. moss, gathered, most disgusting appearance. told englishmen, residing here, natives esteem very great delicacy. one females infant few months old, which teaching swim holding pool water, occasionally letting go. infant make slight effort, let go mother, and, doubt, taught swim almost soon walk. third october, walking through habitable part valley, every met females, who addressed smile, finely modulated tone voice, "coare ta whyhene?"[6] father one these, good naturedly conducted hut chief, highest blood any valley. man upwards fifty, apparently more civilized than any natives seen before. told interpreter say, felt pleasure seeing hut. about forty twenty feet, constructed same way occupied happah chief, differing respect common people, except dimensions. rank importance displayed possession six muskets, two casks powder hung directly fronting door, which chief took occasion point out soon after entered. him treasure, and, fact, wealth consequence every individual seemed estimated standard alone. powder covered over canvass, muskets highly polished. one side hut two logs, about three feet apart, between coarse mat, convenience laying down on, one log intended head, other feet. whilst here, number visitors came in, and, walking directly logs, without noticing any one, threw themselves down between them, heads one, feet other, lay, fanning themselves, looking us, without saying word, except once twice, saw looking them, saluted "motake." middle hut coffin chief's father, who died about six months previous. trunk large bread-fruit tree, six eight feet long, highly polished, lid ingeniously fitted, place contact not seen closest examination. told father

prepared paint, used females, directed son get some root, grind between two stones, mixing little water it, only process required. gave chief's wife (who old woman) some beads, cotton handkerchief, which delighted, threw both arms around neck, embraced most affectionately. painted all over, quite yellow, thoroughly smeared clothes, paid dearly expression regard. parting, chief presented hog (the only one obtained marquesas), some sticks tappa tree, offered whatever acceptable me, about house. also exchanged names, promised again visit him, opportunity afterwards. son accompanied board, carrying presents father made me, all way calling "kappe," name father, himself, name. evening, returned vessel, crowded natives, work day completed. men women different circles, singing songs. women, resembled croaking great many frogs. quick lively motion hands, accompanying various modulations voice, exhibited great activity, command muscle, far more pleasing than music. there one amongst females, who possessed great powers voice, utterance strange sounds, which none rest accompany her. performance seemed distress very much, certainly very disagreeable; yet natives all stop occasionally, listen her, and, done, exclaimed, seeming surprise, "motake!" 4th october, took boat, prepared arms, providing myself few presents, ran down lewis' bay, ascertain depth water entrance harbour, difficulties probably attend running schooner, whether afforded any better prospect than other places visited, obtaining supply hogs. distance only six miles, and, fine breeze, entrance harbour little more than hour. very narrow, formed two high points land, depth water abundantly sufficient ships largest class. heavy broken swell made entrance appear difficult: and, without fair wind, confined, hazardous attempt it; gorge once passed, enter large smooth basin, there scarcely ripple, land rising high all around it, points locking each other. basin found good anchorage, four nine fathoms water, clay bottom. lewis' bay divided into two parts projecting point rocks. first landed which fronts entrance, rather went into edge surf. great many people, all ages, came swimming off through surf, few moments boat full them, fruit various kinds. anxious land, saw there great difficulty getting off again, event any misunderstanding them, which not altogether impossible. not remain long, but, dismissing natives who crawled into boat, hanging gunwale, pulled round point rocks other landing. first went into part harbour, perceive only two three persons, who afraid come near us. gradually relaxed timidity, however, kept nearing little, until last prevailed upon get into boat. soon saw muskets, which thought intended trade; which only protection, ran away, saying, bring hogs directly. mean time news arrival spread, far wide, over valley, people came running every direction, whatever most readily possess themselves of, trade. every body wanted muskets, chief seven eight hogs brought beach, all which offered one gun. after spending hour two here, most friendly terms natives, prepared depart, missed one shoes, thrown off wet. search made boat, without finding it, remarked, native seen crawling water considerable distance rock near shore, deposited something, returned. upon examination, found shoe wrapped up piece tappa cloth, indian stolen it, without reflecting possession one shoe, without other, value him, perhaps not caring whether not, gratified propensity steal. returned short distance, held shoe up show natives recovered it, set up loud laugh, which interpreted into applause, ingenious exploit countryman. valley lewis' bay not compared either other places visited island, beauty fertility. is, however, quite populous, scenery grand picturesque. land gradually rises small plain below, like valley occupied typees, succession hills, terminates perpendicular high ledge rocks. returning lewis' massachusetts' bay, wind ahead, pulled close shore, which, nearly whole distance, rises abruptly, ocean, height six seven hundred feet. numerous falls, which only perceptible heavy mist, before reached water, leaping top, whilst sea beat sides unceasing fury, throwing spray height more than hundred feet. whilst tugging oars, contemplating magnificent scene, sea suddenly became unusually agitated, threatened, every instant, swallow up boat. pulled directly shore, half hour situation very critical, after which sea became regular. phenomenon, remarkable, baffled all speculation, entirely loss determine respecting cause. arrival board, learned vessel narrowly escaped driven shore squall not fault anchorage, consequence baffling winds which several times driven vessel over anchor, whereby fouled cable, tripped violence squall. natives, usual, assembled shore near us, amusing themselves customary way, singing dancing. females, learned some dolphin's crew, not good taste use cocoa-nut oil, paint, such profusion, left off, well golden yellow fruit, which also highly disapproved of. improved appearance, seemed sensible superior estimation which held. wild ladies, truth, who, first arrival, came swimming round, like many mermaids, grew very fastidious short time remained island. after first day two, requested allowed go board, boats, then, seeing some officers carried through surf seamen, nothing less please them, honour visit, gallanted board same ceremony. sailors gallantly condescended gratify two three them; but, instead taking boat, most uncourteously let fall into first heavy roller encountered, leaving choice swimming boat, back shore again, after which none ever asked carried. regard superstitions worship, learn little. john luxon told me, tabooed father, who chief, common man dared pass over head. usually dressed sailor's shirt trowsers, old hat. came off regularly every morning, ate three time day, taking seat table, without least ceremony, never waiting asked. one day, some one had, designedly accidentally, thrown some bread john's hat, which not perceive took up, put on. felt bread upon head, threw hat off instantly, and, look utmost horror, exclaimed, "who put dat dare? taboo here!" (putting hand head) "to-morrow sick, die!" this, repeated over number times, great earnestness manner tried find out who put bread hat, insisting upon it, that, morrow, sicken die. morrow, however, came, john alive well, heartily laughed foolish superstition, came board usual spend day us. not believe john same implicit faith taboo afterwards. tried find out him meant tabooed, spoke english badly, seemed understand little matter himself, not much wiser explanation. told here, that, few years since, missionaries society islands, moved benevolent purpose converting marquesas islanders christianity, sent one number reside massachusetts' bay. missionary landed amongst charge, whom received characteristic kindness hospitality. other notice taken him, however, than bestowed upon most poor ignorant mariner, seeking asylum amongst them. permitted fix upon place residence, live such way pleased him best. soon commenced preaching doctrines faith. natives listened him, wondering all said, not less singular manner life,--to unexampled, all acquaintance whites,--and, certainly, unparalleled amongst themselves. always seen white men, who visited islands, take liberties females, mingle all pleasures, whilst man, who called himself messenger great spirit, lived life celibacy, retired all that, them, amusing agreeable. free interchange opinion taken place amongst them, respecting him, came conclusion, differently made constituted all other men ever seen, curiosity raised highest pitch, they, levity peculiar savages, determined subject him scrutiny. missionary, alarmed disposition evinced little respect character personal rights, took departure first opportunity, since which attempt made convert natives marquesas christianity. men marquesas, were, general, quite naked. few ornaments worn either sex. women frequently other ornament than small flower, stuck through slit ears. some men wore polished whale's teeth round necks, some shell bracelets, not common use. few tattooed all over, others slightly. mode tattooing seemed altogether matter fancy. some indulged most whimsical taste, indelibly pricked into flesh, fish, birds, beasts, all kinds known them. others tattooed black, even inner part lips. art high estimation amongst them. there men, who pursue regular business, great favour countrymen, skilful performance. women tattoo more tastefully than men. feet legs, half-way knee, usually covered figures, wrought great neatness, right hand arm, half-way elbow, often similarly ornamented. both men women commonly wear hair short, instances contrary met with, persons invariably disgusting appearance, hair hanging long disagreeable looking matted locks. men finely formed, large, active; both men women would, many instances, considered handsome, not fastidious objection copper colour. teeth very beautiful, formed subject remark all, while amongst them. not think that, all people came under observation nooaheeva, there single one bad teeth. more remarkable men, accustomed all lives strip husk cocoa-nut manner described. plurality wives not admitted amongst under any circumstances. sexes rarely live together, man wife, until arrived middle age life. man wishes take wife, first obtains consent female, who solicits friends, which, obtained, girl's father kills hog, or, chief, number hogs, makes feast, which all friends both parties invited. after ceremonial performed, which occasion great merriment, parents girl furnish few pieces tappa cloth, conducted husband house. females, although invited feasts, not permitted partake hogs, roasted occasion. tabooed men alone. hogs scarcely ever used natives, upon occasion death marriage. chief, other person dies, possessing many hogs, great feast made. only arms, now generally used, muskets. most natives, who any property, own one more. not see single war club nooaheeva, few spears. met several persons, who scars musket balls, told received battle. each renegade englishmen living chief, who thought there scarcely any thing not perform. besides supporting them, gave all consequence chiefs intercourse natives, far own authority admit it. highly respected natives, even john luxon boasted superiority over other indians, speaking english. asked john, advantage speaking english him, which replied, enabled him cheat countrymen. whole face island nooaheeva high mountainous. every part visited composed volcanic cinders, evidently owes origin some great convulsion nature. whilst remained massachusetts' bay, weather mild pleasant. several heavy showers, which, one instance, only accompanied squall wind. after showers delightful contemplate beauty innumerable little cascades water every falling over rocks tops mountains. few hours, many become less brilliant, some quite disappear. found longitude anchorage mean three chronometers, one hundred thirty-nine degrees fifty-four minutes thirty seconds west; latitude, series observations, eight degrees fifty-seven minutes forty-five seconds south. october 5th, got under way, stood out light baffling wind, tacking very close both shores. nine, a.m., passed sentinels, bore up westward moderate breeze e.s.e. islands rooahooga rooapooa, plainly sight. clear weather seen least fifty miles. amiable character inhabitants nooaheeva, friendly disposition evinced towards upon all occasions, made feel regret leaving soon. course now lay before us, carried away all civilized world; islands way affording little tempt navigators visit them, known only places, existing wide surface ocean, where, few exceptions, inhabitants never seen face white man. anticipate other gratification contemplated visit them, than indulgence curiosity. weather became squally after departure marquesas, continued several days, during which time frequently deceived clouds assuming strongest appearance land, which steered two three times, under full conviction made discovery. picture ourselves, mountains, valleys, bays, and, confirm deception, frequently saw land birds flying about us. day-light, 10th october, discovered caroline island, bearing w.s.w., distant fourteen miles. weather side it, furious surf every sight, breaking upon reef some distance shore. stood along westward, nine, a.m., passed reef, makes out n.w. end island, protecting s.w. heavy easterly swell, prevailing winds. under lee reef, stood in, hope finding anchorage, getting frequent casts lead, until, great disappointment, discovered there deep sea-water within few feet bed coral, stretched off three four hundred yards shore, farther south west, high surf breaking, only place land, and, desirous exploring island, took small kedge coral bank, which rode easterly trade winds. here landed without much difficulty, made way shore, over coral, although full holes, looked though give way under feet. holes coral-bed one three feet deep, some appearance communicating ocean. holes, found abundance large very fine fish, which supplied crew great plenty. several different kinds, best which red grouper, long fish, dark colour, which name. boarding pikes boat-hooks only instruments used taking them, simple apparatus alone frigate's crew supplied short time. boat also sent fish alongside coral bank, myriads red grouper, large size; sharks numerous, that, every fish, lost two three hooks. tide rises, caroline island, three four feet, and, low water, coral-bank nearly dry. case landed, and, remained there several hours, fishing party surprised rise water, made difficult, somewhat dangerous retrace steps edge bank, holes many places not perceptible, water over heads. made situation more disagreeable number sharks come tide, which occasionally made bite feet legs. one man, who large bunch fish which trailed through water, closely pursued, fiercely attacked them, compelled take refuge upon rock lay way, which not again prevailed upon descend, until boat went relief. caroline island uninhabited. five eight miles long, vicinity anchorage more than quarter half mile wide. there some trees large size upon it, most places thick growth underwood. every bounded bed coral, which generally extends several hundred yards shore. saw animals it, other reptiles than small lizards. sea birds tolerably numerous, few sand snipe seen. weather side island, found cocoa-nut tree, that, all appearance, recently drifted shore. besides cocoa-nut tree, found two articles indian furniture. came inhabited island, there doubt, equally certain island never discovered, there none laid down upon chart, direction trade winds, caroline island, nearer than society islands. marquesas nearest caroline, any land known; distant upwards six hundred miles, differ bearing little general direction trade winds. cocoa-nut tree there two nuts, which appearance short time water. planted near anchorage. caroline island low, every flat, exception few sand hillocks, rise little above ordinary level. more than four five feet above sea. obtained boat-load pepper-grass pursely, which there great abundance; 13th, meridian, unhooked kedge, made sail westward. place landing caroline island, south latitude nine degrees fifty-four minutes thirty seconds; west longitude, one hundred fifty degrees eighteen seconds. previous taking departure coast peru, commander station furnished long list islands, said recently discovered whalers, now vicinity two them, one which laid down south latitude eight degrees forty minutes; west longitude one hundred fifty-nine degrees fifty minutes. other, south latitude, six degrees forty-two minutes; went longitude one hundred sixty-six degrees ten minutes. after departure caroline island, steered supposed new discovery, nearest us, latitude eight degrees forty seconds; and, cruised two days vicinity, bore away, under full conviction not exist, laid down incorrectly. search other island, equally unsuccessful; after running down degree two longitude, parallel latitude, continued southward westward, shaping course duke clarence island. whilst looking new discoveries, frequently deceived same false appearance land, noticed soon after departure marquesas, several times saw land-birds[8] flying about vessel. four, a.m., 29th october, discovered duke clarence island ahead, twelve miles us. day-light, n.w. end full sight, each side it, apparently great distance, tops trees just seen through haze morning, looking though rose ocean. approached nearer, great many islets rose view, connected each other chain coral reefs. sailing round them, discovered formed polygon, sides which narrow strips land coral reefs, comprehending within lake many miles circumference. first got close island, lake, intervening between most distant islets rose utmost limit vision, almost persuaded us, time, extensive group, instead one little island looked like speck upon general chart. lake everywhere protected against ocean, smooth, not undulation seen upon surface. wind light, sea smooth,--the air mildness elasticity spring morning; these deep green spots, upon wide waste ocean, truly beautiful. islets low, rising few feet above water, all covered thick growth cocoa-nut trees. run down within few miles shore westward, where, near beach, few huts, two canoes put off, pulled great rapidity, shortly afterwards not less than twenty sight. all part shore bounded coral reef, upon which breaking heavy surf, wished anchor, look water, continued leeward shore. under easy sail, canoes kept way us, constantly increasing number, having, each them, four seven men. one came very near us, save natives labour working paddles, threw end rope. laid hold very eagerly, instead tying some part canoe, expected done, hauled up close stern get, made motions give more. so, again motioned veer to. this, thought unnecessary, already sufficient purpose intended. found solicitations more not heeded, very deliberately took sharp instrument bone shell, cut rope off, several fathoms canoe. soon done this, took paddles, pulled away all might, soon again near enough rope thrown them, which called loud could, making, same time, significant motions. found not give rope again, paddled up quarter, one them, who powerful man, came board, without seeming fear least. several officers spoke him, tried call attention; but, without taking least notice any body, walked straight stern-netting, commenced most industriously throw into canoe every thing lay hands on. quarter-master others, who near, remonstrated him, vain, against such outrageous conduct. interference seemed only excite indignation, make him more active accomplishing design. found nothing else prevail him, took musket lay near me, gave him slight blow it, calling same time some men, who stood near, lay hold him. seized musket, struck him, taken overboard it, timely assistance who near. made escape before men get hold him, succeeded throwing into canoe log-reel line, besides number other articles, not conveniently spare. pursued canoe, taken stolen articles, all moved such rapidity, hope overtaking them, made attempt. natives other canoes witnessed success comrades carrying off booty, which displaying around them, great delight, encouraged come near, make similar attempt plunder. somewhat cautious, however, witnessed resistance made. next theft breaking off one rudder-irons waist-boat. captain, who near, prevailed upon fellow give up, which did, without least hesitation; but, remaining quietly was, seized opportunity, captain's face turned him, and, snatching piece iron out hands, jumped overboard, swam nearest canoe. all time close shore, getting frequent casts deep sea lead, moment overboard, line seen natives, made dozen canoes, instruments sharp shells, fastened sticks, endeavoured cut off. paid not slightest attention remonstrances threats, only way which prevent effecting object, hauling line fast possible. after running along shore several miles, seeking vain anchorage, began examine reefs, connected islets, great solicitude, hope finding opening into lake, whore protected wind sea. this, however, soon despaired, passing south-west point island, bountiful little bay opened view, upon shore which surf beat less violently than seen elsewhere. here hove to, sent boat shore look anchorage. soon returned report that, within less than half cable's length shore, bottom found, upwards hundred fathoms line. now gave up all intention anchoring, permitted natives come alongside, exchange whatever had, mutually acceptable each other. continued follow us, and, growing bold numbers, frequently threw board vessel clubs, cocoa-nuts, whatever canoes, used missiles. accompanied such loud shouting, become numerous, orders ordinary duty vessel not heard. some clubs large, capable inflicting fatal blow violence which thrown, apprehensions suffering some evil consequence licentious conduct new acquaintances, soon realised, one striking surgeon upon head. ill health, just come upon deck witness novel spectacle around us, unwelcome salutation given. alarmed first safety; but, gratification, discovered hat far protected head, wound not severe. soon natives saw schooner heave to, closed around us, many get alongside, came whatever offer. nearly hundred canoes assembled, several hundred men. saw hoisting out boat purpose sounding, became alarmed, took flight. inducement prevail upon come near us, whilst boat lay alongside, soon shoved off, took paddles, retreated fast could; saw took different direction, not object pursue them, all turned followed her. gathered around short distance, apparently afraid approach nearer, first making signs go shore, numerous group men, women, children, inviting people land. seeing boat not go shore, after duty assigned accomplished, returning schooner, natives one accord closed more nearly around her, intercept passage. officer boat made threats signs retire, which paid not slightest attention. canoe came each side boat, natives laid hold oars, man rising each canoe same time, barbed spear, which held attitude throwing. officer, feeling situation very critical one, thinking report pocket pistol cause desist, presented design fire ahead one canoes. not go off, snap signal sufficient men prepare defence, believing exposed greatest danger. seized pistols, one which each man provided, before officer interfere prevent firing (the noise confusion amongst natives such, not heard) one men discharged piece, ball passed through hand one natives. became alarmed extraordinary report pistol, immediately after it, seeing blood flow hand countryman, discontinued assault, retired precipitation. boat then returned schooner unmolested, natives flying every direction approached them. apprehensive report pistol, wounding one natives produce great panic amongst them, interrupt farther intercourse. agreeably disappointed, boat sooner hoisted in, than came alongside, much confidence, though nothing kind occurred. hour afterwards, wounded man seen canoe, fifty hundred yards us, apparently afraid come nearer. distinguished hand bound up green leaves. after making motions him, around us, holding up variety things acceptance, last prevailed upon come near us. saw sentinel, gangway, stopped, vain held up presents him, until sentinel removed. then came board, suffered wound examined dressed, trembling staring around him, like one greatest terror. gratified find wound not severe apprehended, ball passed through fleshy part hand, between thumb forefinger, without breaking any bones, probably without inflicting upon him serious injury. wound dressed, received few presents old iron, &c., him invaluable, left us, jumped one canoe another, activity monkey, holding up treasure, talking great vehemence, apparently delighted good fortune. natives nothing exchange few mats, some which finely wrought, cocoa-nuts, bone shell ornaments, fishing-hooks, which gave them, return, pieces iron hoops, old nails. witnessed several instances dishonesty amongst them, well entire want confidence us. whenever one presented any thing exchange, held firmly grasped hand, until received pay other; first obtained old nail iron hoop, without person, whom trading, getting firmly hold mat whatever be, sure keep both. every man carried long spear, some short weapon, slightly curved like sword. spears eight twelve feet long, some which one some two branches near end. pointed hard bone large fish, and, one two feet point, covered rows shark's teeth, immoveably fixed neat moulding twine passing through teeth, round spear. short weapons armed same manner all over, except small part left grasp hand. both formidable weapons, capable inflicting mortal wound. few wore dry wreaths cocoa-nut leaves round brows, which only kind covering saw any about heads, instances rare, thought probable chiefs. dress loins consisted two pieces, one which composed few plaited leaves, next skin, other consisted mat, two three feet wide, four long, beautifully fringed bottom, which served, not only pretty ornament, useful protection against flies, which almost everywhere amongst these islands very troublesome. strong robust looking men, very dark copper colour, most them, particularly old men, covered scars, gave understand occasioned wounds spears daggers. wore hair long, disagreeable looking matted locks. none heavy beards, general little. not improbable pull out fish-scales, practised marquesas, many others south sea islands. done compressing beard fingers between two large fish-scales, manner applying pair tweezers. great many natives, most women children, assembled shore, opposite us, remained all day, singing amusing themselves. females came off canoes. saw water, except small quantity one two natives cocoa-nut shells, and, much regret, ignorance language, not inquire obtained. land rose more than three seven feet above level sea, not land safety, means ascertaining whether any rivulets existed upon it. island seemed produce nothing, cocoa-nuts, which only food natives, except fortunate catch fish. towards evening stood out bay, hove off south-west point, sent party shore collect quantity cocoa-nuts, which there dense forest, promised abundant supply. people sooner shore than saw natives approaching different directions, armed spears paddles, making signals each other, signs, intruders depart. every tree some peculiar mark, whence concluded, considered property some individual. after sun-down, night closing fast upon party, who finding, determined manner natives, that, whatever took, violence, gave up enterprise, returned beach. fortunate so, tide risen considerably, surf increased dangerous degree. all, however, got off safe, wet jackets, eight, p.m., october 30th, hoisted boat, made sail. ran off fine breeze, half-past three, a.m., made duke york's island, directly ahead, sooner than expected. not more than three four miles off;

moment, rope around old chief's neck, broke grasp, captain enough indian courtesy, well pleased dismiss them. still remained near us, many allowed, came alongside. exchanged pieces old iron, coarse matting, flying-fish, shell ornaments, few disposed spears. one fellow, who evinced obstinate determination come alongside, ordered off sentinel, who pointed musket him. soon musket pointed, raised spear, stood attitude throwing until sentinel came shoulder, again took paddle; musket again presented, indian, same promptitude, raised spear, until sentinel, feeling awkwardness situation, reported circumstance officer. went forward, pointing native pistol loaded very fine shot, motioned him retire; upon which, raised spear me, discharged pistol legs, dropped arms fled greatest precipitation; afterwards remarked him outside all rest canoes, apparently afraid come nearer vessel. after example, none seemed disposed question authority sentinel. islands seen, since departure marquesas, resembling each other much, none affording indications water sufficient purposes, began think seriously, experience great inconvenience, perhaps suffering, before procure supply; determined, therefore, let opportunity escape us, examining every island came way, done without too much risk. view object, captain pulled shore, followed nearly all canoes; arrived edge surf, which heavy make landing difficult, remarked people shore, whom great many assembled, all armed themselves spears stones. hostile appearance, together violence surf, made him hesitate about proceeding further, although natives, shore well those canoes, pressed him land. when, finally, relinquished object, about return board, people shore dashed into water swam off, uniting those canoes, made violent attempt drag boat into surf. men promptly repelled them, dived bottom, coming up, showered volley stones into boat, which wounded few crew slightly, broke several pieces gunwale. midst excitement confusion prevailed, native seized pistol, which struggled violently carry off, until musket fired, taken into nearest canoe severely wounded; effect disperse natives, who fled boat every direction, returned schooner. hoisted in, came alongside, some got board. commenced getting underway, one anchors already up; other hooked coral rock, captain directed sentinel forward, give musket him, repair station. native, who talking captain, embracing favourable opportunity, seized musket, upon which fixed bayonet, jumping overboard it, swam towards shore, keeping half time under water. muskets fired him, bore booty safely through surf coral bank, where, although still within striking distance, marched away most perfect composure, until disappeared bushes. after bold theft, several boats prepared land search water, and, possible, recover stolen property. captain took lead, landed coral bank, arms ammunition wet useless, whilst boat, returning through surf, thrown upon rocks, bilged, before finally got off, almost every timber broke. fatality attended landing, forbade other boats attempt it, choosing rather remain defenceless situation, surrounded hostile natives, more serious consequence losing remainder boats. signals concerted previous departure vessel, directed fire intervals cannon, direction large hut supposed belonged chief. small group natives approached him, one whom, man advanced years, came up green branch hand; captain demanded him signs return musket, reply which, addressed some one near him, who ran off, about hour, brought without either lock bayonet; these also required, demand repeated occasionally discharge cannon direction chiefs hut. not long before lock brought, threats compel relinquish bayonet. situation captain party becoming more more critical every moment's delay. bank coral hundred yards wide, small parties natives, whom great numbers assembled bushes, frequently sally out throw stones them. other means protection defence than afforded guns, which fired whenever hostile parties made appearance. hustle shot over heads, fall cocoa-nut trees, proved superiority arms over theirs, measure, desired effect keeping back. one circumstance, however, convinced not yet fully sensible superiority, so, intrepid degree well alarm safety people. one parties sallied out, there two men walking along beach, carrying canoe; shot fired drive sallying party back, struck near these men, threw sand gravel all over them. laid canoe down looked round few moments, took up again walked along, done under most ordinary circumstances. captain became impatient confined situation beach, besieged harrassed constantly natives, made bold risk excursion back upon island, show natives disregard them, and, same time, satisfy himself existence water. not any oppose him appear numbers; few persons seen behind trees, stealing along through thickets without any demonstration hostility. discoveries few unimportant; only place found water, old well, stagnant unfit use. huts entered, stores dry cocoa-nuts, preparation dried fish sea-moss. filled solicitude party beyond reach assistance, knowing other means safety than opinion which exist among natives invincibility, highly gratified, after hour's watching, see returning old place blockade--the coral bank. now sundown, surf increased much not believe possible boat reach shore return safety; send men there without prospect enabled return, useless sacrifice lives; here people shore; natives followed return beach; remaining after dark probably attended most serious consequences. two men, who good swimmers, came forward volunteered services take shore light boat had, although felt unwilling exercise authority performance hazardous service, happy accept generous offer. landed safety, boat deeply laden captain party, clung one hand quarter, swimming other, until after severe most doubtful struggle, emerged surf, almost filled water, soon afterwards alongside. thought there one more breaker pass, all perished. men byron's island stout, active, well made. all naked, covered scars. some wore skull-caps, grass, wreaths dry cocoa-nuts. ornaments rude, worn very few. consisted shells beads, made something resembled whalebone, worn long strings,--by some round waist, others round neck. hair long matted, complexion very dark. beard thin, curled upon chin, like negroes. few women came round canoes, who looked coarse, almost robust men. wore round loins small mat about foot wide, fringe bottom. few men tattooed, very slightly. canoes ingeniously wrought, great many pieces light wood, which laced together twine, made husk cocoa-nut;

but, after dumb show going some time, patron's face turned him, snatched hat head, jumped overboard it, making way expeditiously possible nearest canoe. canoe took him in, pulled off dead windward us, until out reach, although threw several shot over heads, convince danger encountered such bold adventures. first stopping place, ran down few miles, followed all canoes, which joined many more. some natives again came board, one man, whom captain made presents, seized upon fixture waist-boat, abruptly took leave. suddenly saluted charge bird-shot, pistol, manfully clung prize, bore off triumph canoe. aided companion, playing same trick, fellow who stole sailor's hat. few shot over heads brought to, lay down bottom canoe, until lowered boat, sent them. saw boat approaching, took paddles, made effort escape; but, finding impossible, jumped overboard, continued diving one side canoe other, until taken. trembled excessively, expressing great deal alarm, upon brought board, made several attempts escape. captain inflicted upon thief, punishment, thought useful admonition natives, future intercourse white men, when, companion, jumped overboard, apparently delighted, escaped well. number enterprising character people, changed purpose attempting obtain supply water, digging wells. and, besides above objection, expected that, performance duty, mulgrave islands, necessary explore whole group, where, within great compass, wants scarcely fail supplied. accordingly, evening, made sail, and, after clearing island, hauled up northward westward. inhabitants drummond's byron's islands, were, all respects, similar each other, even canoes sails, latter which coarse matting grass. during passage drummond's island mulgraves, which nine days' duration squally weather, constantly affected violent currents, which, irregular, allowance made. second day after departure drummond's island, safety considerably endangered cause. near chain small islands belonging kingsmill group, weather thick squally, stretched off, calculating that, meridian, following day, thirty miles northward them;

all efforts obtain knowledge, whence came, persons who brought them, unavailing. some natives came board, all whom neatly ornamented. wore wreaths flowers round heads, bracelets necklaces beautiful shells; large roll leaves, one two inches diameter, through slits ears, covering loins, two bunches kind grass, resembled hemp, hanging below knees, one bunch behind, other before. nothing stolen them. behaved most orderly manner, looking round deck inquiringly, seated themselves, chatted familiarly people, taking pains make themselves understood. look action appeared lively intelligent; whenever subject visit pressed upon them, pointing whaler's lance, became silent, pretending ignorant meaning. activity exploring parties, traversing all parts island, close examination every thing amongst them, belonged whites, produced sensible alarm third day; and, besides desertion habitations some them, large canoe missing, departed island during night. beyond us, south west, range islets, far see masthead, thoroughly explored island, anchored, completed watering, made such repairs upon vessel necessary, determined proceed further direction. anchorage here wind several times changed blowing off shore, which, not room ride shore anchor, made it, upon such occasions, necessary get underway, stand off. such times, remarked, particular satisfaction, advantage possessed vessel, schooner rigged, none fore after could, same facility, performed delicate operation getting underway, crawling off, riding upon lee shore, within few fathoms rocks, touched which inevitably attended shipwreck. upon island, besides cocoa-nut, there few bread-fruit trees, growing great luxuriance. golden yellow fruit, which females nooaheeva ornamented necks, grew here greatest abundance, eaten natives almost constantly, who called bup. species small rat, tuft hair upon tail, very numerous, tame, hundreds constantly feeding about huts. first land approached proceeding southward westward, narrow islet, made up dry reefs, verdant spots, one two miles long, two hundred yards wide. most islets grew cocoa-nut, bread-fruit trees,--the invariable indication inhabitants. were, however, thinly inhabited. some reefs connected covered water sufficiently passage boat. captain landed upon eastern extremity, found few people, most whom fled approach, such remained, timid, hardly look upon countrymen near neighbours natives, who treated much kindness anchorage. small canoe came off, paddled one man, who ventured board, looked round few minutes, departed, without seeming any other object view than gratify curiosity. suspected him spy, not believed these people too simple, adopt such expedient civilization. we, however, afterwards ascertained capacity which came, sent principal chief all mulgrave group. schooner coasted along islands, keeping way captain, who continued westward, examining all parts it. beyond, afterwards ascertained inland sea great extent; several large sail canoes discovered coming distant islet. captain crossed reef into inland sea, found water smooth, every filled shoals coral. without indicating wish examine canoes, which caused put back, soon afterwards returned board, another boat sent continue examination islet, advanced. officer prevailed upon some natives, met with, come near him, one gave him, return present, some glass beads. upon arriving western extremity islet, captain put off shore, found four large canoes hauled up beach, those seen before, coming over inland sea, just act landing. afterwards ascertained, high chief mulgrave group, fifty hundred chiefs warriors, cruise observation, satisfy himself who, were, object visit lonely unfrequented isle. none chiefs any thing distinguish them, knew not here upon some ordinary pursuit, otherwise, presence excited much more lively interest. was, gratified opportunity seeing many natives, canoes, which examine, proofs crew globe landed upon these islands, which already pretty well satisfied seen. fact satisfactorily proved few minutes afterwards, discovering upon platform canoes lids several sailors' chests. farther examination, pieces cloth ash-spars also found. natives watching every look motion, notwithstanding pretended apathy indifference, not conceal intense excitement close examination produced amongst them, soon gave rise animated conversation, which accompanied angry looks, only satisfaction gave us, pointed chest-lids, vacant stare, few words island language not more intelligible. not far beach pleasant grove cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees, through which scattered number neat little indian huts. one them, near shore, frequented great many natives, whom people freely mingled. about ten feet high, above ground; small garret, which screened observation floor sticks, thickly interwoven leaves. although most huts examined men, good ill fortune, this, many constantly assembled, escape observation. there found one men, afterwards informed us, whom anxiously looking; discovery attended bloodshed, and, perhaps, fatal consequences shore party, than whom natives much more numerous. william lay, one globe's crew, brought islet, chiefs, used circumstances suggest. concealed garret hut, guarded number old women, who directed, first whisper noise made, put him death, chiefs also denounced heaviest vengeance upon him, should, any way, disclose secret there. lay unhappy situation several hours, listening interchange opinion amongst countrymen, whose conversation informed character vessel, object cruise. towards sun-down, parties weary labour day, repaired board night, natives, getting into canoes, took departure islet, steered away, over inland sea, until lost horizon. stood off during night, and, nine morning, anchored nine fathoms water, near place landing. here there channel into inland sea, nearly water enough schooner, through which made unsuccessful attempt pass. situation now becoming very unpleasant. necessary parties shore, exploring islands, remainder crew quite insufficient get vessel underway,--an expedient indispensable, whenever wind came shore, anchorage hardly ever extended more than half cable's length it. lose nothing delay want perseverance, however, soon after came to, officer, party eleven men, attended boat take over drowned reefs, sent march round, explore islets, formed continued chain southward westward us. felt conviction, conduct natives, unwilling give intelligence required, depend entirely upon industry good fortune, any discovery make. evening sent boat communicate party, advanced far, she returned without seeing any them. following day, november twenty-fifth, weather clear pleasant, boat sent refreshments our exploring party, who overtaken distance ten miles us, just commencing morning's march. islets, thus far, narrow, not averaging quarter mile breadth, thinly inhabited. our party pleased conduct natives seen. gave cocoa-nuts, without receiving any thing return, evening, stopped repose night, provided huts sleep in. officer party, course day's march, found mitten, name rowland coffin marked it, who, referring list globe's crew, proved one boys left mutineers. place party found, extent island not seen. landed settlement anchored, found hats nearly all deserted. such natives, remained, seemed disposed very friendly, followed beach, shot few sand-snipe, which drew loud shouts applause, witnessing effect musket. near huts observed number small white cranes, one which shot, supposing wild, afterwards regretted very much, learning domesticated, held great reverence natives. five morning, november twenty-sixth, squall arose eastward, which struck vessel adrift, direction trending land, and, dragging off bank, hove anchor up, stood along shore westward. run fifteen twenty miles, came up our party, whom sent refreshments, proceeded on, passing several remarkable points. three, p.m., came to, under point, which somewhat protected sea, ten fathoms water, about thirty fathoms coral rocks, there three feet. considerably advance our party, whom now determined march round whole circle islets, information mutineers not sooner obtained. front islet wider than any seen elsewhere, presented noble forest cocoa-nut, interspersed every broad green leaves bread-fruit tree, which indicated most luxuriant growth. huts scattered about through trees, some close shore, forming peaceful romantic scene. landing good low water, practicable high tide. far see westward, land still continued. surgeon, who very much debilitated, sailed coast peru, gradually, almost imperceptibly, become more feeble, some time past believed disease liver. until within two days coming our present anchorage, discharged ordinary duties, attending sick, mind began fail, evident period existence near close. lay time state insensibility, receiving little aid friends afford him; forty-five minutes after four, p.m., november twenty-seventh, breathed last, deeply lamented all crew, whom greatly endeared himself, kind assiduous attentions, even extremely ill, knew fast hastening close life. morning, took party men shore, grove, foot wide-spreading bread-fruit tree, made narrow bed our departed messmate. nine, vessel struck adrift, dragged off bank. she again stood towards shore, landed, many officers men spared bury doctor's remains, honours war. natives assembled, number twenty thirty, followed grave, watching all our motions expression great surprise. silent until first discharge musketry, burst into loud shouts laughter, which drove back, threats punishment, considerable distance us, afterwards remained quiet. foot head grave planted seeds orange, lemon, cheramoya, upon bread-fruit tree, head it, carved name, rank, vessel which belonged. below spiked, firmly upon tree, brass plate, name, age, vessel which belonged, day death inscribed upon it. little eastward grave satisfaction find two springs excellent water. following morning our party arrived, and, after receiving refreshment, continued northward westward. crossed long reef, connected islet abreast another, distance few miles, appearance large settlement, immense cocoa-nut forests rose direction. soon after crossing reef, arriving extreme east end islet, narrow sandy, suddenly came place strewed several hundreds staves beef pork barrels, old pieces canvass cloth. advancing little further, found skeleton, lightly covered sand, box, containing few spanish dollars. natives, some whom constantly following our party, occasionally mingling them, administering, well their wants, upon approaching place disappeared, seen distance, skulking through bushes. these discoveries excited liveliest expectation soon making others more satisfactory, proceeding mile further, found unoccupied hut, where, night approaching, encamped. early morning took up their line march, not gone far, evident natives preparing hostilities. groups frequently seen distance, armed spears stones, holding animated discussions. much more numerous than our party, who, upon examining their ammunition, found wet, few arms had, which other than pistol, each man, also wet, unfit immediate use. officer, therefore, determined retreat place night's encampment, until despatch information situation, ask reinforcement ammunition. arriving spent night, found hut occupied gone, also large sail canoe, left there, taken away. not single person any seen. here remained, sending two party schooner, which now several miles him. little after meridian, received board, heard, great interest, information gave. there no doubt our minds, place mutineers, others globe's crew, left,--but now?--was question, which naturally occurred us. given natives no cause, excite hostility; but, contrary, taken every means suggested itself, gain their confidence esteem. wished make war upon us, opportunities frequently presented, our exploring party assailed overpowering numbers, prospect success, which not availed themselves, here now apparently wavering between peace war, just moment our discovering place our countrymen been. knew not account change their conduct, supposing mutineers amongst them, that, our near approach, becoming alarmed their safety, roused natives war, hope defending themselves open combat. supposition true, seemed very probable, situation our party very critical, no time lost giving aid asked for, renewing our search redoubled activity. launch hoisted out, fitted all possible expedition, four, p.m., november twenty-ninth, sailed two officers eleven men, together three belonging party, all willing spare schooner, bold attempt upon large party natives, led enterprising desperate chief, placed lives all crew greatest jeopardy. crossed reef, which sufficiently overflown high tide, admit it, ran down inland sea encampment our party, arrived eight evening, found all safe; looking our appearance, greatest anxiety. allowed boat's crew land, get their supper company those shore, preparatory commencing their night's work. prepared our departure, embarked, greatly chagrined examining boat, find shore party, whom brought fresh arms ammunition, had, their over-anxiety well supplied, deprived part mine, under necessity landing, searching, not only men, even bushes, before found them. our party acquired no information since morning, discoveries already made, felt satisfied, following day, find other traces mutineers. taking departure, stretched off fine breeze, blowing directly point which wished steer. suffered men lay down refresh themselves sleep, whilst midshipman s. myself steered boat, regret, returning back towards shore whence started, discovered lost ground; besides, our boat clumsy badly fitted, found contend strong current. got oars out, therefore, pulled dead windward until day-light, proceeded about six miles, again made sail northward eastward, close haul upon wind; gradually veered, until head island eight ten miles us, which just appeared above horizon, designed land give men breakfast. within two three miles island, observed number canoes leaving places nearer landing upon it. two canoes put off thence, standing beating clumsy boat weather intervening coral reef; manned about twenty natives, all armed spears stones. approached pretty near, passing under lee, ran alongside examine them, which gave great many cross looks. soon suffered depart, immediately returned shore whence came, not long afterwards discovered about twenty canoes carry twenty forty men each. canoes boarded, sailed least three miles one, now discovered impossibility possessing ourselves mutineers globe, whilst they, natives, friendly, them, disposal such fleet vessels, which avoid whenever our too near approach endangered their safety. determined, therefore, take possession all now assembled, even though opposed natives, reduced necessity measuring our strength them. island small, producing few nut trees, small number huts upon it, notwithstanding which, there several hundreds people assembled;--a great crowd, considering thinly populated state islands. large assemblage only brought together some extraordinary cause, determined land search their huts, look round, before made wide breach them, necessarily result seizure their canoes. sorry see, our coming near them, sending their women children towards huts, which short distance assemblage natives; movement indicated want confidence their part, still less agreeable us, disposition hostility. there some surf shore about land near canoes, boat more readily our disposal occasion after landing, dropped anchor, the act veering through the surf, when, astonishment, person dressed looking like native, addressed our own language. standing upon the beach thirty forty yards distant, half way between the natives, all whom seated themselves. the first words understood, were, "the indians going kill you: don't come shore unless prepared fight." the scene now presented us, inspired indescribable sensation; for, although convinced one the men anxiously looking for, sudden unexpected appearance, wild attire, above all, warning, seemed like illusion fancy. hair long, combed up, tied knot the top head; round loins, wore large mat, finely wrought, the use cocoa-nut oil, the action tropical sun, nearly two years, made skin almost dark the natives. earnestly repeated, several times, not land unless prepared fight, described the plan the natives concerted him, which was, prevail upon come shore seat ourselves amongst them, when, given signal, all rise knock the head stones. statement probable enough, the suspicion one the mutineers, very naturally occurred our minds, the questions, "why not found him before? and, not now fly protection, innocent?"--forgetting our contemptible numbers precluded all idea safety him, opposed the numerous assemblage natives whom surrounded. asked name, which told william lay, one the crew the globe. stature juvenile appearance, answered the description him. told him come the boat, said afraid the natives, who directed him not advance any nearer us. then directed him run protect him; declined, saying, the natives kill him stones before could get there. during all time, thought arranging their plan come shore, called out frequently him know said; which, replied way calculated suit purpose. after discharging re-loading our pistols, one which cartridge-box each man provided, landed, marched up the place lay standing. still doubting whether not more foe than friend, determined that, under any circumstances, not escape, received him left hand, presenting, the same time, cocked pistol breast. not insensible the sentiment harsh reception calculated inspire; circumstanced was, could not risk every thing preference inflicting momentary pang, keenly felt. repeated the question, "who you?" which replied, "i man," burst into tears. told him then say the natives, rose their seats, threw stone, shoot all; the poor fellow, delirious joy the moment, knew not said, and, instead obeying command, called out half english, half island language, broken sentences, most which unintelligible us; amongst other things, exclaimed, "they going kill me, going kill me." ordered him silent, then asked, told going kill him.--recollecting himself immediately, begged my pardon, declaring knew not saying. time, some the natives risen, becoming very animated violent their conversation gestures. two three advanced towards us; pointed my pistol them, made lay repeat my threat, which the desired effect all one old man, who, unarmed, advanced defiance me. lay desired suffer him approach, which did, taking hold lay's hand both his, asked countrymen going him. lay explained him, few words, clearly could, which the old man seemed much affected. benefactor, the person whom indebted life; the poor fellow seemed not wanting sensibility gratitude, the moment their parting. embraced him affectionately, told him see him again before departed, wept like child. unwilling remain longer than absolutely necessary, lest the natives, recovered their first surprise, conceive contempt our small number, make trial our strength, which knew much superior us, determined brave, the first discharge our pistols place upon equality the same number ourselves. therefore cut short lay's interview friend, hastened him the boat; there wept joy, gave several proofs the agitated state mind. first impulse, which great credit heart, was, inquire friends well, then recollecting probable none knew them, told belonged east saybrook, connecticut, asked any acquainted section the country. several times repeated the same questions, forgetful asked before, replied the negative. mind little composed, made inquiries him respecting the rest the globe's crew, who left the island; which answered, all dead except cyrus h. huzzy, who island few miles windward us, now full sight. asked, expression great solicitude, go huzzy, told him would, seemed afford him not less pleasure than own deliverance. stated huzzy both knew search them, our vessel man war. said the chiefs sent spies board the schooner every day practicable, who communicated the number guns carried, and, within very few, the number which the crew consisted. apprised the force conduct our exploring party, descending the minutest particulars, even describing most the individuals board. seriously debated the question making war upon several times, always consulted lay huzzy the propriety it, probably their prospect success. dissuaded it, course, filled apprehension, declaring, repeatedly, invincible, there scarcely any thing could not accomplish our six-pounders; even made believe, trifling our armament was, could sink the islands our cannon: ready the human mind receive truth cannot comprehend, recommended superior intelligence, though variance every thing nature reason. the natives told let go pleased, without molesting any way, give whatever asked for, and, all times, show themselves friendly us. strictly pursued the course conduct pointed out the young white men, whose superior knowledge our prowess, placed every reliance; still doubted the probability conciliating our friendship the sequel, adhered tenaciously the idea accomplishing our destruction some way, make their own security the more certain. object, variety plans submitted different times, lay huzzy, those amongst the chiefs esteemed the wisest bravest, all which discouraged, the success such undertaking any way, frequently declared utterly hopeless. one their plans was, get alongside night, unobserved, some the sharp instruments obtained the globe, make hole the bottom the vessel, sink her; when, very truly believed, those who not drowned, easy prey them, the party shore, unaided the schooner, soon overcome destroyed their superior numbers. another their plans, the most plausible one, was, assemble secretly all the canoes the islands, some point not distant us, approaching under cover the night, surprise board us. last plan put into execution, dark night, possible succeeded, could hardly seen time use our cannon, the fire musketry which heard before, probably not driven back advanced near us, particularly if, apprehended, night, the fire not directed effectively. not found entirely unprepared; for, under the impression the mutineers still living, terms friendship the natives, the lookout such attempt made, seemed the only means which could possibly escape, the plan which most naturally occur desperate men their situation. advancing towards the island expected find huzzy, lay told the island found him favourite place fishing particular season, numerous shoals fish swam upon shore. our schooner anchored the place residence the high chief, who, those found assembled upon the small island, fled there avoid us. the boat's crew oppressed fatigue hunger, landed upon dry reef, after proceeding few miles give rest refreshment. painful witness lay's anxiety depart, who, fearing messenger despatched the chief who huzzy custody, kept eyes fixed upon anxious, hurrying look, several times expressed fears the chiefs the boldness attempt rescue. finishing our frugal repast, pulled up under uninhabited point lugoma's island, (this the name huzzy's chief,) which, passed without observation, ample bay, upon the shore which situated the village the chief, opened our view; and, our great joy, the only sail canoe possession, seen hauled up the beach. few moments, no one seen; the act landing, lugoma several old women came walking down the beach, attracted the strange unexpected appearance our boat. struck the utmost consternation beholding lay, who still native dress; the old women began calling out, loud tone, demanding him there, wanted. before time reply them, got out the boat, taking, hold lugoma, pointing pistol him, bade lay say him, unless huzzy brought immediately, kill him. begged not hurt him, said huzzy near come me. the old women, alarmed the safely the chief, instantly ran off, calling aloud huzzy. few minutes before appeared, walking towards us, fine yellow hair hanging ringlets about shoulders, person quite naked, the exception piece blanket, tied round loins. approached sufficiently near, said him, "well, young man, wish return country?" eyes filled tears replied, "yes, sir; know nothing done which afraid go home." soon lugoma felt relieved apparently dangerous situation, began express solicitude huzzy, begging not hurt him; assured no injury intended towards son, called huzzy, entreated not take him away. the old women united the chief the expression their wishes, seemed, their loud talk significant gestures, insist upon the white man's remaining them. the scene interesting one, found picturesque group assembled beautiful lawn, front number huts, surrounded cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees. huzzy owed life the native chief; the condition slave him two years. him indebted many acts kindness, some which requited industry service, some cancelled harsh treatment; yet, still stood delicate situation towards the chief. the saving his life alone, conferred obligation upon him, which could scarcely repaid long faithful services. the chief evidently appeared regard him his son, the moment our departure arrived, saw determined take our countryman us, joined tears entreaties, saying weep long bitterly him. told huzzy come back again, asked bring him. the only way which could get clear strange petition, urged much feeling, promised bring him back his mother consented his return. this, appeared tolerably well satisfied, about returning the boat, lugoma took huzzy aside talk him privately. their interview ended, asked huzzy the chief saying him; which replied, reminding him difficult him get along his work without him, return soon could, bring him some axes, guns, cloths, such his countrymen wore. "i promised bring them," said he, "when return, quite satisfied." ready depart, conciliate the good the female part lugoma's family, presented variety trifles, such finger-rings, glass beads, &c., which, return, loaded profusion small mats, rude shell ornaments, accompanied many expressions thankfulness regard. came take leave lugoma, presented him jack-knife. the exception axe, could given him nothing more valuable, gained his unreserved confidence. immediately proposed going the schooner, got into the boat his son, lad eight years old. huzzy took him musket bible, the only things saved the massacre. the first preserved him the chief, who thought huzzy's hands, although no powder, match all his enemies; the bible clung himself, kept the companion his lonely hours. the bible more object curiosity the natives than any thing else found the possession the white men: often inquired huzzy was, use, &c., his explanations seemed only increase their superstition aversion it. never pleased see him retire the garret his little hut, read it, his custom; invariably remonstrated him against it. urged him frequently destroy it, refused, threatened themselves. the reason their dislike, said bring spirits round the house kill hurt some the family. huzzy told them, destroyed it, the great spirit come kill all; which probably indebted preservation. walking, back the huts, over level green spot, enclosed cocoa-nut trees, lugoma came great haste, disturbed look beckoned come away, the same time saying huzzy, not go there: place the dead; my presence disturb them, bring spirits round his huts; indulged his superstition, walked off. lugoma about thirty years age, moderate stature, square built, low forehead, flat nose; expression countenance indicated intelligence enterprize. huzzy gave him the character very passionate, inveterate his enmities, fierce determined his hostility, firmly attached his friends, possessing benevolent heart. often became offended huzzy, their ordinary occupation, upon such occasions use violent language, sometimes threaten kill him; but, his passion subsided, very sorry said, soothe huzzy telling him not afraid; not hurt him. once, however, working their canoe, something went wrong, raised paddle struck huzzy it, upon which, the poor fellow, slave was, gave way his indignant feelings, the act repaying the chief's violence interest, who, seeing gone too far the high-spirited white man, his life menaced, begged him not strike, declaring never again raise his hand against him; the quarrel amicably settled huzzy's telling him, ever did, kill him. story, thought there some truth the one which huzzy told one day related him lugoma's son, the boy the boat us. mulatto lad board the schooner, the time our contemplated capture spoken amongst the natives, little boy told huzzy his father going save the life the mulatto boy, then kill him getting too large. the mulatto boy great favourite amongst the natives, upon several occasions, quarrels arisen amongst the chiefs who him, the presence lay huzzy debating the question our capture. the day far advanced left lugoma's island, stood along the shores the islets intercept the land party whom met no very great distance, making rapid marches. landed inform our success, their labour end, which could not rejoice us, although extremely disappointed not themselves the fortunate persons, after all the toil experienced the search. put off made sail both our boats, the canoes all still upon the beach the island whence taken lay, intended land get his musket, which, the hurry our departure, forgotten. no sooner, however, the natives see both our boats standing towards them, than put off all their canoes, bore away directly before the wind. made all sail chase, soon perceived leaving very fast; and, night coming on, made the experiment few musket shots, fired over their heads, the hope bringing to. instead answering the desired purpose, served only increase their alarm, the weather becoming squally, suffered depart without further pursuit. cause regret fired; the first discharge, poor lugoma the greatest agony, fear going kill him, well the rest the chiefs. all the explanations lay huzzy could make, all their assurances my friendship, could not quiet him. several times taken his son jumped overboard, allowed him so. whenever went the stern the boat sitting, repeated again again my good friend, not kill him; my replying not hurt him, his friend, &c., not the least effect; only caused him again repeat before told of, his my friend, not kill him. the numerous shoals coral, the violence the wind, rendering somewhat dangerous run the dark, determined come the night, yet long distance the schooner. purpose, stood towards the place where, the preceding night, met the exploring party. lugoma no sooner found himself near the shore, than became more earnest than ever his petition be permitted land his son, although more than twenty miles his home. allowed him leave us, not apprehensive the hostility his countrymen; knew not his aid piloting our night's encampment, be surprised before morning, my resolution keep him confirmed, reported me, some omen who landed the other boat, one more natives seen near us, skulking through the bushes. also determined, not trust ourselves shore, lay the boat, make awning our sails, screen the heavy showers frequently coming over, the best manner could.--when finished our repast, hauled off anchored, not sleep. our awning poorly calculated shelter, the showers constantly succeeded each other, kept too wet cold rest; besides this, frequently reminded lugoma's presence, who made pay dearly his detention. lay no else than alongside me, during the whole night, not more than ten minutes elapsed any one time, not move his hand over my face, thought my attention sufficiently awakened, call out me, "hitera;" word signified my good friend, nor suffer rest moment afterwards until replied him "hitera." anchored short distance the place the chief mutineer the globe his murderous companions landed--where fallen their hands, they, their turn, been killed savages. spot, calculated revive, the minds lay huzzy, the liveliest recollection sorrows sufferings, no language could describe; all wished hear account the mutiny, the events subsequently transpired, desired lay favour the relation. lay's narrative follows: "the first heard discontent board the ship, few days previous the mutiny. went the maintop-mast-head, found comstock; after few moment's conversation, said me, 'what do, william? bad usage: take the ship, run away?' did not make much any answer. not now remember said; quite inexperienced, my first voyage. the afternoon, the next morning, heard him talking some the men the forecastle about running away him arrived funning's island, which, believe, then steering. this, suppose, the purpose sounding them, find out their disposition, who join him the mutiny.--from heard, began think all not right, tried get the news aft, unfortunately did not succeed. the afternoon, before the night which the mutiny took place, the main yard furling the mainsail, tried then tell the second mate, paine comstock between us, afraid say any thing. comstock had, some days previous, taken his cutlass the cabin into the forecastle; boat-steerer, used eat the cabin the officers. knew nothing more about until twelve one o'clock the night the mutiny took place; sleeping the forecastle, rowland coffin came awoke me, saying come upon deck, taken the ship. got up went aft, all the crew mustered the quarter-deck. comstock told had done, his regulations were, said, such not swear stick him, go the other side the deck. did not know many engaged the mutiny, believing be killed did not swear, all swore stick comstock obey his orders. then told haul the third mate up out the cabin; one had take hold the rope made fast him. laid him the gangway, thought dead; comstock throwing him overboard, clung the ship his hands. comstock told some one bring axe cut his hands off, let go went overboard. saw him the water astern, swimming after the ship some time. then made sail; comstock the only navigator board. first went the kingsmill group, did not like stop there, the natives very numerous thievish; besides, comstock had shot one stealing something; after which, afraid stay amongst them. drummond's island, the kingsmill group, came directly the mulgraves, made part them, anchored commenced landing the stores. "the crew the globe consisted between twenty-five thirty; the only persons engaged the mutiny comstock, paine, oliver, the black steward, (lilliston, who one the mutineers did not mention.) midnight, previous descending the cabin, one the number placed sentinel the cabin door, axe, comstock saying young brother who the helm, did not keep the ship course, kill him soon came deck. comstock killed the captain striking him the forehead axe whilst sleeping, first locked the mates up their state-rooms, not escape. then went the other mutineers, and, believe, cut the throats the first second mates, shot the third mate. did not see any the third mate, told the others thrown out the cabin windows. "not many days after the mutiny, the black steward detected the cabin loading pistol which forbidden pain death; asked comstock intended it, replied, first, "nothing;" but, questioned more closely, said had heard smith some one else say, intended take the ship. smith the other person named the steward, called up comstock, asked had threatened take the ship; which replied the negative, insisting had never intimated intended any thing the kind. comstock declared such offence could not go unpunished, the steward be tried court martial; thereupon told the steward choose one man, said choose another, the two sentence the steward such punishment the offence merited. the two men accordingly chosen, the steward selecting rowland coffin his advocate, comstock, paine his. after hearing the evidence, deliberating short time, found the steward guilty, sentenced him be hung the yard-arm until dead. immediately afterwards, all hands called witness the execution; the steward taken forward given fourteen seconds make his peace god.[9] the foretop-mast steering sail haulyards overhauled down tied round the steward's neck, comstock, after making every body take hold the haulyards, held the fourteen second glass one hand, his cutlass the other. the glass out, gave the signal the people run away the haulyards, striking the ship's bell his cutlass, and, moment, the criminal run up the yard-arm. "after the death the officers, comstock made all live the cabin him, the mutineers used sing, carouse, tell over the story the murder, had dreamed. paine oliver, who could scarcely ever sleep, spoke horror their dreams, ghosts appeared night; comstock always made light it, appeared exult had done. said once, the captain came him his wounded bloody head, showed him had done, told the captain depart never come again, would kill him second time. "after our arrival here, made raft two whale-boats some spars, the first second day, landed thirty forty barrels beef pork, sails, rigging, variety other articles, comstock pitched tent shore, commenced the mechanics work whale-boat going raise upon make larger. paine displeased his doing soon, sent word him had better discharge the ship, then work upon the boats. greatly enraged comstock, who hailed the ship boat, her sent him, came board. there paine had violent quarrel, paine dared him take musket go shore him fight out, which comstock refused do. landed, afraid paine oliver would kill him slept the tent, went off pass the night the natives; his absence, paine oliver agreed shoot him came back; accordingly, the following morning, seen coming along the beach alone, "and had arrived within good gun-shot, commenced firing him; without changing his pace, continued advance, drawing his cutlass, called out paine stop firing would make peace him; paine, however, continued fire, and, the third fourth discharge, comstock fell lifeless upon his face, ball pierced his heart. fearing not be quite dead, perhaps would get up again, paine ran up him axe, cut off the back his neck. buried close the tent, the manner had often expressed wish be, all his clothes on, his cutlass hung his side. upon first landing, had fixed upon site town, amongst other public buildings contemplated erecting, church, which had selected considered eligible situation. "the natives all the time very friendly, not the least afraid them. great many came our tent every day, some there day night, eating, drinking, sleeping us. paine had girl brought another islet, who did not like stay us, would run away whenever she got opportunity; fired muskets her several times, last, used keep her putting her irons. few days after the ship ran away, some the natives, who had been the tent, stole number tools. paine gave four five our people muskets without cartridges, sent the natives, great many whom assembled not far off, the stolen articles. the natives refused give up, soon began throw stones our people, who, knowing had not the means resisting, began retreat; the natives pursued them, throwing stones, one the party, rowland jones, either fell knocked down his pursuers, who came up immediately afterwards killed him. the party returned the tent, paine, who had taken the command after comstock's death, ordered all the muskets brought him, locked them up. all about the tent, few hours afterwards the natives came there usual, greater numbers. after had been there little while, some one remarked, 'i afraid going kill us; all got spears, stones, sticks their hands.' upon this, paine said believed all taken, safe. the words scarcely out his mouth, the natives commenced the massacre, knocking our people the head stones clubs, sticking spears them. old man his wife laid hold me, one each side, led little way off the bushes, where, thought going kill me, only held fast protected the violence several who came wanted kill me. saw two the natives lead paine off little way, thought going save his life; proceeded only few yards, one them took up stone struck him the head; attempted run, second blow brought him down, immediately afterwards killed him. oliver, did not see; the natives told ran short distance, overtaken killed the bushes. sandwich islander us, got the water, overtaken killed there." "were there any women the massacre?" "oh, yes, children too. the women seemed take active a part the men. saw one old woman run a spear the back one man, who held two natives, a degree violence seemed far beyond her strength. thought all myself killed until the following evening. had been taken the islet schooner anchored, all the chiefs assembled, brought huzzy, show there one living besides myself. after interview a few hours, huzzy taken away live lugoma, who had saved his life, taken live the old man who had saved mine. very poor scarcely ever got enough eat the coarsest native food. had labour very hard, although suffered constantly hunger, which soon made weak extremely wretched. last, the high chief took compassion upon me, made live him; after which, had always plenty eat, liberty work not, pleased. very kind every respect. always brought huzzy me, taken see him once a fortnight, once a month, suffered pass the day together." here lay's narrative ended. huzzy told us, during his residence lugoma, his time had been spent principally the water, going him his canoe, which required two work it. lugoma a great fisherman, distinguished amongst the chiefs his industry enterprising character. would always enough eat, had steal it. huzzy would complain him the hard laborious life led, lugoma would always reply, would eat work. there seems be no doubt, the natives saved the lives these young men no other motive than making them slaves, availing themselves the advantage their labour. the dawn day, prepared depart the schooner, getting up our anchor, which a kedge, weighing upwards a hundred pounds, found hooked a bunch coral the bottom, which all our efforts failed move it. soon lugoma saw our difficulty, told his son go down clear the anchor. the little fellow jumped into the water, which about three fathoms deep, a few moments came up, making motions haul away. had disengaged the kedge, had no further trouble getting up. a universal practice amongst the natives, whenever wish anchor, take a line the end the canoe, tie a tree coral the bottom. the chief persisted his desire leave us, saying still afraid would kill him; had no object taking him against his will, consented his departure, presenting him some seeds, the culture which caused be explained him, also the value the fruit. our return board welcomed every body. had now accomplished the object our visit, the islands altogether void interest, except their novel formation, the singular habits the natives, well content leave them return some other place more congenial the feelings civilized men. before left, however, wished see the chiefs, after representing the impropriety their conduct toward the white men who had sought asylum upon their islands, point out the course future pursue towards such again visit them. the morning december the first, none the chiefs people residing upon the islet abreast returned, the mother the high chief directed send her son come back, bring him the rest the chiefs, without delay. made a visit the chief's village, i found few inhabitants, most whom women children. situated the side the island opposite us, bordering upon the inland sea. not extensive, a beautiful romantic spot; the grove cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees, through which scattered the huts the natives, ran about a hundred yards back the inland sea a wild thicket passes through the centre the islet, length two three hundred yards. here i found the largest canoe i had yet seen. large enough carry fifty men, old, leaked badly, the high chief compelled leave behind, his flight, all the rest. near the high chief's hut, came consecrated ground. the place burial the royal dead. a small space, comprehended within the circumference a few yards, the head each grave stood a cocoa-nut tree, bound round dry leaves,--a mark prohibited the use the fruit. accompanied a son the high chief, a child about twelve years old, who desired not tread the graves his ancestors. two graves pointed out, those chiefs, who had been highly distinguished, beside which stood the aged trunks cocoa-nut trees, indicated the period their demise been very distant. one the huts saw a domestic fowl, which, i expressed a wish purchase, the chief's son, whose name ladro, immediately presented me. afterwards saw a number others running wild the thickets. small, looked like what called the bantam. the natives never eat them, giving, the reason it, not cleanly their food. our return, lay took a place, where, after the massacre, had buried a spanish dollar. still there, took him a memento his captivity. passed several springs water, which the women banished a certain period. met a native, whom lay knew, who, assuming the native dress, went through the violent motions gestures a mulgrave man, engaged battle. indescribable mixture the frightful ludicrous. i apprehensive would offend the native: laughed the representation, said, very good. the following morning, december the second, disappointed not seeing the chiefs. the captain went again the high chief's mother, who made some excuse their not appearing, declared, would positively be up night moonlight. told her send them again, say, not there the morrow, would go after them, the consequence might be serious. the old woman seemed very much alarmed hearing such language, promised a faithful compliance the part her son. had the desired effect, the following morning, december the third, the chiefs all presented themselves the shore, near our anchorage. the captain, taking lay huzzy him, went shore meet them. told him, way opening the interview, his power, ready obey all his commands. required them restore a whale boat belonged the globe, a swivel, had taken the white men, lay's musket, all which cheerfully assented. then gave them, a proof his friendship, some cotton handkerchiefs, axes, a variety other articles, much more value them than those had taken. told them, white men would never come there hurt them, always be kind friendly them, whenever ships hereafter visit their island. that, other white men ever be similarly situated those had killed, take care them, some future time would be rewarded it. promised faithfully all told, regretted killed our countrymen. gave them a pair pigs, male female, which told them take great care of, increase the number much possible, forbidding them, pain our displeasure, kill any until again return, which might be no very distant period, although uncertain when. the surgeon's grave made a sacred spot the high chief, every thing about be held the same reverence the burial-place his forefathers. the high chief instructed, through the interpreters, the manner cultivating the fruits vegetables, the seeds which had given him great variety. some planted, all be under his especial care. the use the various kinds explained him, well their importance ships, might visit his islands, which would give him return them, axes, whatever else most valuable him. the fourth december, i obtained a boat, set off a visit lugoma, who, contrary his promise, had not yet been board. i took huzzy me, knowing would delight the chief see him. met a variety obstacles our passage, through the inland sea, did not arrive the islet the chief until the second day after our departure. stood into his bay the midst a heavy shower, notwithstanding which, soon saw us, himself son ran down the shore meet us, waded up the middle the water, extending their arms towards us, full roasted fish, which had taken a large quantity the preceding day. both them called huzzy, repeated expressions their happiness seeing him, and, a moment after struck the shore, the whole tribe old women welcomed us, their joyful exclamations. soon were out the boat, each one turn clung round huzzy's neck, embraced him the kindest manner. several different huts were large piles fish, amounting some thousands, which had been roasted preserve them. lugoma offered once accommodate the night, saying, had abundance room his huts sleep, plenty fish eat. the weather squally wet, which induced accept his offer. i wished, also, witness the manner which caught fish such quantities, another opportunity might not offer before i left the islands. soon the shower over, which lasted two three hours, lugoma went out, employed himself busily collecting breaking up dry wood, arranging his ovens stones, all might be readiness cook the fish soon were taken out the water. there a considerable shoal extending out the shore, opposite his huts, upon which the fish, their migrations along the islets came great numbers. the outer edge shoal had sunk, a few feet below the surface the water, a long line cocoa-nut leaves, which were dry, a reddish colour. one end the line leaves taken the shore, made fast, there a pen, built stone. the line then taken round upon the shoal semi-circularly, encompassing a considerable portion it, the space between the other end the line the shore left quite open. a school fish seen, the natives intercept them, driving them through open space, and, pressing forward, finally into the stone pen, which taken nets. after all the arrangements were made, lugoma another native, waded out beyond the line leaves, watch the schools fish, but, unfortunately, allowed them all escape; and, well ourselves, seemed be a good deal disappointed his bad success. what appeared be most remarkable about method catching fish, that, after inclosed, not pass under the cocoa-nut leaves, although there a depth several feet water between them the bottom. lugoma took the place had planted the water-melon seeds, i gave him the time our parting. had cleared mellowed the ground care, preparatory planting the seeds, which were already up, looked thrifty. i bestowed upon him a great deal praise, planted a variety other seeds, fruit vegetables, which promised abundant supply me, i again return. night came, the hour repose hand, i perplexed the difficulty providing our security against surprise treachery, without giving lugoma reason suppose did not confide his friendship, which i knew would infer, any particular watchfulness our part. i did not believe had reason apprehend danger lugoma any one else, were exposed it, had the means security, i determined not run any risk. three the men were sent sleep the boat, anchored off a short distance the shore, which lugoma told no one must approach. the rest were directed bring their arms shore, keep a lookout through the night, rotation. the arrangement made, had all lain down, except the man standing sentry, lugoma saw him, asked, there not room enough him lay down. answered evasively several times, a view satisfy the uneasiness expressed, lest should be thought wanting any respect hospitality; were last obliged tell him, the man keeping watch, see no one came hurt us. his mortification evident, remarked, reply, no one would come his island hurt us. expressed our full confidence his friendship, giving him the further information, our custom always some one the look-out. lugoma arranged mats upon the floors his huts all, invited lay down one side him, his wife daughter the other side. blew rained hard all night, the morning clear pleasant. set off a visit islet a few miles beyond lugoma. offered go us, dive a large shell-fish, found there; could not take him, without incommoding ourselves, declined his company. the islet uninteresting, hardly repay the trouble going it. covered a thick growth hard red wood, common most the low islands, wild bup. soon took our departure it, returned lugoma's islet, early hour the day. the first time, the mulgraves', i observed, one lugoma's huts, a drum, resembling those nooaheeva, small dimensions. i supposed instrument music, compliance my request, lugoma readily consented play it. calling his daughter him, bade her thump upon her hands, whilst sung, time the music, a few short lines, throwing himself a variety attitudes, alternately extending one arm, great vigour, drawing the other his breast. upon inquiring what the subject his song, told me, through huzzy, the massacre the white men,--a rudeness, i did not expect,--even the untutored lugoma. i declined any further display his musical powers. were preparing return board, lugoma came several times, saying, i might just well cut his throat, lake huzzy away him. "i no one," said he, a distressed look, "that equally capable assisting me, work my canoe, now, going away his musket, my enemies come kill me." finding, last, could not prevail upon leave huzzy, said, must bring him back very soon. that, were long absent, should not find him living. said, must bring him clothes, like ours; guns axes; should share the government his islet him, promising abundant supply us, all the fruits vegetables had planted. the old women had taken affectionate leave huzzy, requested take two three females my boat, their baskets fish, which were intended a present the high chief, land them upon the islet lived. consented so, and, after landing them, arrived board late the afternoon, the schooner run down the globe's anchorage, she now lying. the following morning lugoma made his appearance the beach, his little son, landed his canoe upon the opposite side the narrow islet. a boat sent bring them off. the chief stared wildly round, astonished, wondering every thing saw. very timid, and, notwithstanding our kind reception, appeared feel extremely doubtful his safety. his confidence a measure gained, however, gave him axe, a piece cotton handkerchiefs, some other trifles; left us, reminding me my promise return. not long after his departure got underway, ran back the residence the chiefs, where, ten, a.m., came our old anchorage. the captain went shore, two, p.m., december the eighth, returned board the high chief, two others. were shown every thing about the deck, without awakening much apparent curiosity. then beat quarters, let them see what a formidable appearance made, arrayed battle,--an appearance, truly ridiculous one accustomed the imposing effect a fine ship war, calculated excite our risibility, notwithstanding the seeming gravity assumed the occasion. the captain asked the high chief, did not wish hear one the cannon fired, which answered evasively, unwilling, i suppose, acknowledge his fears, had been a great warrior his time. the captain then told him, would one them fired, not afraid, which brought the chief a confession, dared not hear it. the chiefs brought a number presents the tamon,[10] called the captain, consisting principally mats. became tired remaining board, expressed a wish be sent shore, gratified them, got underway. the high chief's son, who had visited me a number times before, whom i had made presents trifling value, important him, came board his father, expressed a wish go me. his father gave his consent, perfectly willing should go; there great probability opportunity would never offer him return, i thought would be cruel take him his native islands, where, his father's inheritance, would be well provided for. late the evening got underway, the mulgraves, the last time. had surveyed all part the islands intervening between our first anchorage the globe's landing, now steered the eastward the bearings had previously taken. squalls wind heavy rain coming on, soon lost sight the land. the loud roaring the surf, off the extreme north-eastern point, well the heavy swell set immediately afterwards, apprised had cleared the group. the land sight the mast-head, the morning, ran down the eastern end the island, had first anchored, a convenient distance run along upon the weather side, taking hearings the end every base three four miles. near the centre the windward part the group passed a wide opening into the inland sea, not far which a reef considerable extent, a very high surf breaking. within a short distance the reef, saw the bottom plainly ten fathoms water. there no place the weather side the islands, possible land any degree safety. after passing the extreme northern point steered off, the trending the land w. s.; and, sun-down, were up the island, whence i had taken lay, sailed nearly round the group. here hove the night. the group mulgrave islands, called, form a circular chain narrow strips land, which no more than half a mile wide, inclosing within the circle inland sea, one hundred forty miles circumference, filled shoals reefs coral. every bounded the sea-side, a bank coral, protects the violence the ocean. bank generally extends a short distance the shore, goes off into unfathomable water. the chief's islet, buried the surgeon, wider than any other place about the group, upwards a cable's length, which, a low coral island, be considered good anchorage. the whole circle broken alternately into clumps, a few feet above the water, level low coral reefs, some which above high-water mark, some sufficiently low afford a passage boats. the clumps vary length, none them more than two miles long, without interruption a dry drowned reef. covered a thick growth bushes, trees small size, except the cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees rear their tall heads, wide-spreading branches. wherever these grow, the underwood disappears, the place the appearance old forest, cleared a pleasure ground, a few trees been left standing, the advantage

shipwrecked seamen, might be the means sustaining life, no other food could be found, and, a never-failing resource, ought be generally known amongst those, who navigate the pacific ocean. the tree generally grows twenty thirty feet high,--sometimes singly, more frequently small clusters. the diameter the body rarely exceeds six inches. a hard thick bark, the wood spongy, like the cocoa-nut tree. stands half a dozen a dozen roots prongs, which propped up two three feet the ground. the fruit exact resemblance a pine-apple. smell, ripe, first agreeable, but, powerful, soon becomes offensive. the taste the ripe fruit much the same effect--agreeable first, like a mellow, sweet apple, cloying nauseous the stomach, taken any quantity. the ripe fruit never eaten the natives the mulgraves. green, not considered a state be eaten, until a beard, which grows out alongside the stem, acquired a length four five inches. then be taken the tree, eaten raw, roasted between hot stones. the soft part the seeds (if i call them) alone palatable, the other part hard tough. the manner eating is, twist the soft part off the teeth, whereby the juice expressed. there little about the islands would excite the interest either the botanist naturalist. saw few flowers plants. the islands were swarming a species small rat, had a tuft hair upon tail. the natives spoke them very troublesome. throwing a small quantity food upon the ground, near one the huts, dozens them could be collected together a few moments. one the natives sick, the friends collect the hut, lying, chant over him, appease the offended spirit afflicted him. the same prescription given all diseases, which a tea, made herb found upon the island. death takes place, the friends the deceased assemble, mourn over the body, keeping until becomes very offensive. frequently, the midst their most bitter mourning lamentation, some the mourners intentionally say something calculated excite mirth, all burst out into immoderate laughter, their mourning were the affectation children, soon the humorous excitement passed over, again relapse into their mournful strain howling chaunting. the body be kept no longer, the day interment arrives, the grave dug, the corpse taken upon sticks, carried the friends the deceased, followed a large concourse, who move along without order, some one occasionally breaks upon their solemnity a humorous trick, which gives rise others, sets them all laughing. this soon again succeeded mourning. the body lowered into the grave, covered up, a little canoe, a sail it, laden small pieces cocoa-nut other food, been previously prepared, taken the sea-shore the leeward part the island, sent off, a fair wind, bear far away the island the spirit the deceased, may not afterwards disturb the living. this ceremony considered indispensably necessary, never neglected. the head the grave a cocoa-nut planted, the tree springs which, held sacred, fruits never eaten, times the greatest famine. their burial places usually a short distance back the houses, the females strictly prohibited going them. their marriages conducted little ceremony. a man fancies a female his wife, makes the proposal her, which, agreeable, applies her friends. meet, hold a consultation, the propriety the match, decide whether take place. the man's suit denied, nothing more said the subject. united, said be very faithful, jealous each other's chastity. lay huzzy related occurrence, took place during their residence the islands, which shows keenly a sense injury felt them, jealousy sometimes inspires them the most ferocious deadly revenge. a young man had taken a young woman a wife, whom supposed be a virgin. a very short time after she went live him, however, evident she pregnant, before the period which nature prescribed had elapsed, gave birth a child. the indignant husband took the infant mother's arms, her presence dashed head upon a stone front his hut. an act which, under other circumstances, would have suffered death, a custom the islands, forbidding the destroying human life; and, the female superior rank the man, the daughter a chief, believed would be punished. her friends were loud their calls justice upon the offender, until a council the chiefs called, the matter brought before them. after an investigation, the chiefs were satisfied, the woman had grossly imposed upon her husband, whom suffered depart without censure. permitted the men have many wives get; food very scarce, find difficult support one, there few, even the chiefs, who have more. the high chief the only exception this remark the time our visit. had six, one whom a particular favourite. latuano, the high chief the mulgraves, called the greatest warrior the islands had produced a long time. told us one his wars driven his islands, remained (i think) fourteen days sea his canoe, most the time out sight land. steered an island, which, according the tradition his countrymen, lay the west the mulgraves, and, after a great deal suffering, arrived there safety. the high chief this isle (south pedder's island) received him kindness, after had visited thirteen different islands the group,[11] sent him back the mulgraves a fleet canoes, a great many men. arrived there safety, conquered his enemies, the time our visit tributary the chief pedder's island, who had given him a daughter grand-daughter marriage. told us every few years the chief pedder's island, who very powerful very wise, sends a fleet canoes the mulgraves, tribute. lay huzzy were have been sent him, also the globe's whaleboat swivel. i particularly struck latuanos' strong resemblance general bolivar. his stature about the same, his face bore the same marks care serious thought, his attention not awakened any particular thing; and, animated conversation, the same vivid expression beamed his fine features, sparkling black eyes. i could not think, i looking him, general bolivar could be placed near each other, similarly dressed, would be difficult tell which the indian chief, which the patriot hero. the high chief absolute his authority, but, the administration justice, particularly the life an individual concerned, influenced passing judgment the opinion the chiefs most consequence.[12] like all other men, whether civilized uncivilized, have different grades rank their society, the high chief down the farthest remove relationship royalty. the different islets inhabited, partitioned off different chiefs, who acknowledge their subordination the high chief, sending him a part whatever grows, taken within the limits their government. send him a portion their cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, bup, the fish birds, may be caught themselves any their people. the high chief requires this the support his numerous family. besides his wives children, usually keeps a large number men about him, who go his canoe, perform other essential duties his service. several the principal chiefs also attendance, live him constantly. his family, there no ceremony, remind the common people their lowly condition. all eat, drink, sleep alike. dress, there nothing distinguish the chiefs the common people, except the former sometimes wear a mat comes down the knee, straw, finely wrought. this, however, i believe, only worn upon particular occasions. the men wear bunches grass hanging down before behind, such i have described our first anchorage, about the size appearance a horse's tail. those most common use, were a reddish colour; a few them were white. the bark which made taken a long running vine. the boys go quite naked until ten twelve years old, a dress similar the men put them. their ornaments consist shell bracelets necklaces, sometimes a string thorn put round the head; flowers, be obtained, often used instead shells. many the men, some the women have large slits their ears, through which put rolls leaves one two inches diameter. the women wear beautiful white straw mats, elegant workmanship, about two feet square, sometimes larger, bordered round the edge, one two inches, black diamond figures, worked coloured straw, died the husk the cocoa-nut. usually wear two these mats, one which behind the other before, tied round the waist a beautiful round cord braided straw. the ornaments the women the same those worn the men. have no manner worship. acknowledge the existence a great spirit whom call kenneet, who, say, make them sick kill them: look nothing good him, and, far i could learn, have no idea rewards punishments after death. have a sort conjurers amongst them, whose art entertain great reverence, whom place a strict reliance. them apply all cases great emergency. their art consists a large bunch straws, which fold double tie a great many different ways; if, after the straws thus folded, doubled, tied, they be drawn out without any manner entangled the one the other, the omen propitious; otherwise, the contemplated undertaking relinquished. the following morning again resorted to, until success promised. must never be tried the morning, only once the same day. the morning i took lay the natives, the chiefs had recourse this art before they would allow him speak us; they were promised good fortune, otherwise would have been concealed us. who cannot perform the mysteries this art, not allowed drink the same cup him who can. they had a great aversion hearing us whistle, particularly their houses, would invariably run up any our people they were whistling, a fearful look, beg them stop; saying, would bring spirits about the house would make them sick kill them. one them wronged another who died, they were enemies, never eats without throwing away a portion[13] his food appease the ghost the departed. a meeting had the chiefs shore, the captain remarked an old man the circle, whose name character asked lay huzzy; replied to, said, a stern manner did not like his face, meaning looked like a bad man. the old fellow, seeing himself the subject conversation, asked the interpreter what the captain saying about him. told, his countenance expressed the utmost dismay, a day two afterwards, died. there not a native the islands whom lay huzzy conversed, did not believe the captain's dislike killed the old man. they seemed entertain the most singular notions the captain's supernatural powers. the purpose ascertaining what idea the high chief entertained a god, the captain asked him several questions, which his answers were vague unsatisfactory. thought had conceived the right one, asked the chief who thought made thunder. after a moment's hesitation, looked the captain replied, "i suppose make thunder." this satisfactory any thing could be made express. thunder believed produced the agency a superior himself, the captain conceived be infinitely his superior. not long after the massacre the white men, the natives were visited a disease caused their limbs swell, produced great distress amongst them; before unknown, they ascribed lay huzzy, who, they believed, had the power afflict them manner, had done be revenged the death their countrymen. they finally charged them it, threatened kill them, which, all probability they would have done, their superstitious fear some greater evil. their huts not, generally, more than ten fifteen feet, ten fifteen feet high. they divided into two apartments, upper lower; the lower open all round, without any thatching; the floor raised a little above the adjacent ground, covered over small pieces the cleanest whitest coral be found. the rafters small sticks laid across them the thatching, secured twine made the outer husk cocoa-nut, which the thatching also secured. the thatch the leaves palm cocoa-nut. the ceiling the lower room generally low, one must bend almost double get into it, remain, must be a lying sitting posture. the garret a floor sticks thickly interwoven leaves; higher than the ground floor, an air comfort. the natives keep their provisions it, all such things they would preserve the rats. they also sleep there wet weather. the floor, a hole left just large enough a person crawl through, far the sides the rats cannot get it. their canoes display the greatest ingenuity, i have no doubt, a civilized country, they would be ranked amongst the rarest specimens human industry, unassisted the rudest implements. the model most singular, differs all i have ever seen use, either the european american world. construction remarkable, many respects inconvenient, seems improbable the model should have had origin any other cause than the want suitable timber a more perfect structure. the depth a mulgrave canoe, common size, four five feet; length thirty forty. narrow a man scarcely stand it; perfectly flat one side, round the other. sharp both ends. the mast twelve twenty-five feet long, the sail, (a straw mat,) which bent a small yard, very large proportion the canoe. they always sail the flat side, have the mast a little inclined forward. supported shrouds a guy either end, which used pleasure give the mast its proper inclination. beating windward, instead tacking do, presenting the other side the boat the wind, they bring the other end the boat it, making the bow which before the stern. amidships there several light spars extending about ten feet over the round side, four over the other. across these smaller sticks, which securely lashed above below, over them made a platform. upon part which extends over the flat side, they have a small thatched cabin, which they store whatever they wish preserve getting wet, would conceal observation. the other part the platform intended keep the canoe upset; hard pressed carrying sail, several men sometimes get it, keep the canoe upright. they move through the water astonishing velocity, and, turning windward, no boats surpass them. although the natives had no other tools work than what they made shells, previous the visit the globe, every article their workmanship neat, highly polished though had been wrought steel. the construction their canoes, the keel-stern sternpost solid pieces hard wood, upon which they built up small pieces laid one above the other, closely seized the line cocoa-husk. the seams neither caulked payed, the canoe consequently leaks so much require one man bail constantly. the steerage very laborious; they have no rudder, the only means which they steer, a long flat paddle held the hands the helmsman. steer a large canoe blowing weather, requires the utmost strength six eight men. upon the outriggers platforms, along the masts, they arrange their spears, which always taken them, even upon the most ordinary occasions. the canoes also always ballasted a quantity round stones, weighing about a pound each, which forms a material part their armament. our carpenter several days work upon the canoe the high chief, caulking graving her. had completed his work, the high chief, after expressing his gratification, earnestly solicited the captain leave him the island; said would always provide him an abundance eat, no one should ever hurt him. this, according the high chief's standard, the most ample reward could promise useful services. the people the mulgraves general moderate stature, well made. their complexion not so dark the natives the duke clarence byron's island, their features more comely. they appeared us like a different race men. they have not the flat noses thick lips the low islanders, except two three persons saw would come under description. their hair long invariably combed out great neatness, tied the top their heads. their deportment modest manly, after one becomes a little accustomed their dress, they have always an air gentility. they have a fine majestic walk, which one would hardly suppose, considered their way everywhere paved sharp coral. after had given them the pigs, amusing see what apparent pleasure they carried them about their arms, nursing them much care tenderness, though they had been children, whilst the pigs, unused such treatment, were kicking scratching the naked bodies the poor natives, squealing away most lustily. had interfere keep the pigs killed kindness, finally prevailed upon the chief forbid their petted this style. not improbable that, a few years, the whalers may have occasion cruise, the vicinity these islands, find an abundant supply. hoped, however, until they become numerous, no navigator who may chance touch there, encourage the natives diminish their number. 4, a.m., the 9th december, took our departure the mulgrave islands, stood the westward. daylight, had lost sight the group, 10, a.m., made south pedder's island. stood a little too far the southward, were all day beating up weather the n.e. point, where, sun-down, hove the hope the following morning should be able effect a landing, get a sight the great chief, so celebrated amongst the people had just left. the 11th december, passed all the early part the day searching vain anchorage, hove to, a little after meridian, opposite a considerable bay, upon the shore which a native village, large forests cocoa-nut trees. the captain took huzzy the gig, and, followed another boat, pulled over a wide coral bank the village. a few people were attracted the shore the appearance our boats. they immediately conducted the captain the chief, who seated a mat the open air, front his hut. seemed little moved the unexpected appearance his visitors. a very old man, had a long white beard came down upon his breast. the natives stood round respectful silence, the old chief addressed the captain, whom he soon distinguished the person highest rank amongst the strangers. he spoke the same language the inhabitants the mulgraves, huzzy forbidden let him know he understood, listen attentively what he saying those around him. a time his intercourse the captain carried signs, huzzy overheard him say the natives, standing by, "don't disturb them yet. wait until to-morrow, see what they going do. they look round here see what they find, trade a little, go board their vessel, sleep, to-morrow they come again." the captain told huzzy address some questions the chief his own language, seemed operate quickly an electric shock upon the natives, who stared wildly around him, each other, looks the utmost astonishment. the chief partially lost his gravity the sensation produced, not less surprised than his subjects. he asked huzzy, before answering the question put him, he had learned speak the language pedder's island. huzzy replied, he had learned the mulgrave islands, he had been two years. the old chief said, he had been informed two white men there, then fitting out a fleet canoes send after them. he expressed a great deal disappointment, had taken them away, saying, he would have had them brought his own island, treated them well. he asked, lay also board the vessel. the captain had taken shore a present the chief, a number trifles, he thought might be acceptable the natives. our people endeavoured obtain a quantity cocoa-nuts bup, which there the greatest abundance; the natives parted their fruit very reluctantly. finally the captain addressed the chief, upon the subject giving selling us a supply, he said,--no! his island thickly inhabited, produced no more food than necessary his people. that, were want cocoa-nuts bup, there were other islands, not far the westward, there an abundance, few people, he advised our going there speedily possible. upon asked, he had ever seen white men before, he replied,--yes; a long time ago there came a large vessel, which there were white men, who brought their forge shore, they remained several days. this, he said, the only instance. the young women were all sent away, concealed the thickets, upon a distant part the island, they remained during the whole day. amongst other presents made the captain the high chief, a battle-axe,--to him an article the greatest value. he received it, however, reluctance, expressing his regret, he had not his power make a suitable return so valuable a consideration, accompanying his apology a small present mats, cocoa-nuts, a preparation the ripe bup, had an agreeable sweet taste. after dark our party left the village, went the beach embark. they had already left the shore a few yards, some natives came running down, called them return, saying, the chief had another mat the captain. they landed, they were told, the mat the village, huzzy must go it. the captain, not choosing send the mat, put off again. a few moments two three other messengers came running the beach, calling the boat return. she had pulled a few yards the shore, they said the chief wanted huzzy go up the village the mat, he did not wish keep the axe, which he had sent back the captain, unwilling, supposed, lay himself under so great an obligation its acceptance implied. the captain refused take the axe, telling the messenger say his chief, what had given, never took back, and, this, left the shore returned board. the tide had risen considerably over the coral bank, the party found the surf somewhat dangerous returning, their boats nearly filled water. the dress general appearance these people, well their language, the same the natives the mulgraves. their canoes were also the same. saw only three four sails, which were hauled upon the beach. the power the great chief must, therefore, consist his dominion over other islands the northward westward him, there an almost connected chain several hundred miles, which, he undertakes an important enterprise, he must, a great measure, draw his resources. probably the object collecting forces the great chief, latuano visited so many islands during his exile his own, which he last restored foreign aid. eight the evening, made sail the northward westward, a fresh breeze the eastward. the weather clear, stood under easy sail all night. early the morning land discovered, bearing nearly west, soon afterwards more land seen the north. the last ibbitson's island, appeared be separate discovered first. not improbable, however, they connected coral reefs, were too distant us be observed. the land all low, had the appearance the mulgraves other coral islands. meridian, hove to, put off two boats. passed leeward the island, crossed a drowned reef, extended far the eye could reach the n.w., found ourselves an inland sea, which extensive quite smooth. part the island landed was about five miles long, a quarter a mile wide. upon the margin the inland sea, there were a number huts, landed, not an inhabitant could be seen. the huts had evidently been recently occupied. the island was covered abundantly cocoa-nut bup trees, a few the bread-fruit were here there be seen. the shore the inland sea the water was smooth unruffled, the humble neat dwellings the natives, scattered about amongst the cocoa forests, presented a scene quiet repose, peculiarly soothing the mind, contrasted the eternal war breakers the ocean side. had not been long shore before found a few old people, who had concealed themselves the bushes, and, although they were first afraid us, they became less timid, increased number, had presented them some pieces iron, a few old buttons. return, they gave us mats, fishing-nets, cocoa-nuts, bup, the last which they filled our boat. their dress language was the same the mulgraves, their habitations canoes were also the same. amongst all these islands, the natives ascend the cocoa-nut trees, the way i have described the marquesas. here saw several very old people, some whom had lost all their teeth,--a circumstance had not before remarked any these islands. there were also two three cripples, who were not less remarkable, the first had seen. all the females were very old, and, upon inquiring the cause, they replied, the young men had sent the young women away, fear they would be given presents. two three large sail canoes came a great distance over the inland sea, approached us without fear. the natives told us they had never seen white men before. the captain landed upon a different island myself, the natives, fled their habitations they did upon the island i landed, he sent a few old people, were found, commanding all the inhabitants return their homes, and, fearing his displeasure, a few minutes their huts were occupied the same manner though the white-faced strangers had not appeared amongst them. five, p.m., returned the schooner, our boats laden fruit, soon afterwards made sail, shaping our course the sandwich islands. were favoured south easterly trades, blowing fresh gales a number days, which rendered our passage materially shorter than would probably have been otherwise. what was still less have been expected than a south-east trade the northern tropic, was a strong current, set us the rate thirty forty miles a day, n.e. the latitude sixteen twenty-five north. part the time experienced this strong current, the wind was blowing a double-reefed top-sail breeze east e.n.e., differing only two four points the opposite direction the current. arrived the latitude twenty-three degrees north, the trades left us, the winds became variable. meridian december the 24th, were, our calculation, thirty miles an island, said have been discovered recently a whaler, which made bear us e. n. our latitude observed was twenty-five degrees fifty-seven minutes, n. longitude, chronometer, one hundred eighty-six degrees twenty-seven minutes, w. ran off the eastward all the following day, meridian, december 25th, observed, latitude twenty-six degrees, n.; longitude one hundred eighty-three degrees twenty minutes w., without seen the slightest indications land. christmas day, gave the crew a dinner turtle, which were still fat, very delicious. had fed them occasionally upon bup other vegetation, was found upon the islands. december the 27th, came within the vicinity another new discovery a whaler, meridian, had bearing, our calculation, s.e. ten miles. ran until six, p.m., december 28th, no appearance land sight, hove about, stood the northward, a newly discovered reef, which, meridian, bore us, calculation n. e., distant one hundred miles. latitude observed, twenty-six degrees ten minutes n.; longitude, chronometer, one hundred seventy-six degrees fifty-one minutes, w. the reef which were now steering was called, the discoverer, clark's reef. was said extend sixty miles, a south-west north-easterly direction, thought impossible should escape our observation, laid down any near the given latitude longitude. nine, p.m., december the 30th, were within twenty-five miles the centre the reef, our calculation, was blowing a gale, were scudding before an unusually high sea, hove the night. three, a.m., again made sail, ran the centre the reef. meridian, december the 31st, the centre was still twenty miles us, bearing n. e. n. meridian one, p.m., steered n. e., then bore up, steered east all the rest the twenty-four hours, without seeing the reef any indications it. meridian, observed, latitude twenty-six degrees forty-seven minutes, n.; longitude, chronometer, one hundred seventy-two degrees eleven minutes, w. continued the eastward, the hope falling two islands a reef, another whaler's discovery. our confidence their given latitude longitude, however, was quite destroyed frequent disappointments, now looked their discoveries, would have sought lands, known only the tradition the natives some unfrequented island, the hope finding them, little expectation success. happened these, all the rest the new discoveries had looked for. passed within a few miles the latitude, ran down one two degrees longitude, without observing any thing indicated the vicinity land. the second january, 1826, ran off the southward east ballard's island. during the middle the day, the sea, very heavy, became comparatively smooth, continued so sixty miles, the heavy swell again set the westward, before. three, p.m., the fourth january, a rock was reported the mast-head, eight leagues us. proved be ballard's island, called. eight the following morning, passed within two hundred yards it. about two three hundred yards circumference, rises two hundred feet the sea. one side a considerable inclination, seals had crawled up, several were basking the sun, almost the very top. large flocks birds were perched upon its ragged sides, wending their flight around it. not the least sign vegetation was any be seen. near its base, was a small rock, ten twenty feet above the water level. ballard's rock rises three equi-distant peaks, the centre which the highest, all them, the very base, white bird-lime. a high surf breaks all around it. our observations placed north latitude, twenty-five degrees two minuses; west longitude, one hundred sixty-seven degrees fifty minutes. the evening january the fifth, the weather became squally, constant flashes lightning distant thunder. south west, n.w., the heavens were obscured a heavy black cloud, which rose great rapidity. furled all sail. the cloud ascended our zenith, became perfectly calm, a roaring was heard the air several minutes, like wind through the tops pines, hail-stones an unusual size began fall upon our deck, accompanied very sharp lightning heavy thunder. the hail was short duration, passed over without a breath wind. the nearest the sandwich group was bird island, which steered, the ninth january, eight the morning (having the preceding night been enveloped fog) was discovered close us. tacked stood close the south-west side, was a small sand-beach, fifty a hundred yards long. the captain, taking the globe's whale-boat, went shore fish, seeing a few seal upon the sand beach, was induced land. soon afterwards became squally blew great violence. the surf upon the beach rose the wind, and, the captain, after a short examination the island, attempted return, he found impossible launch his boat through the surf, was reduced the necessity passing the night upon the island. blew a gale rained torrents all night. the captain his boat's crew took shelter a cavern upon the sea-shore, they had not been long a comfortable fire they had made, when, the rising the tide the sea broke upon them, they difficulty escaped the side the rocks, thence upon the sand-beach. the island was high almost perpendicular, the floods fell rushed down its steep sides, rocks a large size were disengaged their beds, came tumbling down every direction, the great peril the captain his boat's crew, sufficiently uncomfortable the torrents water were falling driving upon the gale. after a little search, they found an asylum a cave the side a mountain, they passed the night. the morning, they ascended the mountain, the schooner was no be seen. was high steep, she had beat up within a few miles the island passed their line sight. their disappointment chagrin was inexpressible, supposing, the schooner's not sight, she had been driven off, would be a considerable time before she could return, afford them relief their situation so much required, very much fatigued exhausted their exposure. day-light, the weather cleared the wind moderated. beat up hove off the sand-beach nearly soon the boat had sent refreshments. the captain saw the schooner approaching close the island, he made a last effort launch his boat. they succeeded getting her into the breakers, the first heavy roller broke under them severed the boat amid-ships, the captain upon one end her a man could not swim the other, were hove up safely the beach the succeeding wave. the rest the boat's crew were good swimmers, also landed safety. our boat was not far off this occurred, anchoring near possible the shore, the men, all one, swam off her through the surf. the only way could devise get the captain seaman off, was float a cork-jacket shore, the end a line, which being put the captain seaman, alternately, a rope tied round them, they were hauled through the surf without any other injury than swallowing a quantity salt-water. bird's island an uninhabited rock, about a league circumference, the highest part five eight hundred feet above the ocean. our boat landed, the only spot a landing could be effected, upon side alone an inclination which may be ascended. every else perpendicular, a distance, looks like the work art. a scanty vegetation. five, p.m., january the 11th, made sail the island oahoo, a fine breeze the westward pleasant weather. daylight, the following morning, saw the small island onehow, soon afterwards, the highland atooi. during the whole day, were coming up sailing along the west side atooi, moving the rate eight nine miles per hour. a clear day, may be seen least fifty sixty miles. did not approach nearer than eight ten. had the appearance, distance, beautiful table-land, being every very regular nearly the same altitude. towards evening, the 12th january, made the island oahoo, should have been anchor onavoora the following day had passed between atooi oahoo, some mistake about the prevailing winds the opposite side oahoo, continued round the north end it, did not anchor onavoora until the sixteenth. two three american merchant vessels were lying there, which exchanged salutes. the dolphin was the first american man-of-war ever entered a harbour the sandwich islands, the firing the guns, the report widely circulated an american man-of-war had arrived, brought the inhabitants far near the shore the harbour witness the novel sight. several our countrymen, who were traders here, had been expecting us some time, came board offer their congratulations, invite us shore partake their hospitality. was highly gratifying us upon landing, meet nearly all our countrymen residing the island, who came down, en masse, the beach, welcome us shore, the most kind friendly manner. were a little disappointed, however, came look round found none the missionaries had partaken the general sentiment. they were also our countrymen, the character benevolence philanthropy they had assumed themselves, we had a right expect they would have been amongst the first hail us a welcome their lonely abode. we expected, indeed, they would not only have received us countrymen, friends, whose kindness, sympathy would be highly acceptable them their peculiar situation. the shore we were escorted a large frame building called the wooden-house, then occupied our countryman, captain wilds, a handsome dinner was prepared, which every luxury was added could be obtained the shipping the shore. we were much surprised landing, find a rabble naked half-naked natives, amounting many hundreds, we had been taught believe, the various information we had received, their condition was much improved, they were far advanced civilization. they were all ages, formed a more varied fantastic group than i had any seen, even no degree civilization had taken place, an intercourse white men. some them were quite naked; some had their native dress tappa cloths; some had cotton shirts, some a pair old trowsers, some nothing an old jacket. many them had adorned their heads wreaths red yellow flowers, some their necks wrists necklaces bracelets shells. they expressed the greatest pleasure seeing us, shouting crowding around, so we could not get along without pushing them out the way. appearance, a comparison them the natives the marquesas mulgrave islands, would have been greatly their disadvantage. the following day, we were again invited dine the same place, we met a second time our countrymen, interchanged them those sentiments friendship sympathy naturally arise meeting a strange land, which felt americans peculiar force. appeared us they could not sufficiently express their gratification seeing us oahoo, the most unremitted attention, they continued feast give us parties every day more than a week, until our various pressing duties made inconvenient us partake them. the first sabbath after our arrival, i went the place worship appointed the missionaries the natives. a large building, formerly occupied this purpose, had been destroyed a short time previous our arrival, they had now no house sufficiently large contain the whole congregation, the place appointed worship was an extensive enclosure the rear a large frame building, which occupied the dwelling the young king. within this enclosure, was assembled about a thousand people, i supposed, seated the ground. some them were dressed silks, cottons, calicoes, others were their native dress, being quite naked, except about the waist. they were the open air, without any protection the sun, which was pouring its vertical rays upon them. mr. bingham, the head the mission, was addressing them the language the island, he saw me the outer edge the circle, very kindly beckoned me come round the queen dowager was seated. he was standing there himself. a native was holding an umbrella over his head, around him were seated all the chief men women, some chairs, some them the ground. one two exceptions, they were all people uncommon size. some them were quite neatly dressed, others had displayed a most whimsical ridiculous fancy. i came near cahumanu, who was the favourite wife the departed highly distinguished tamahamaha, she extended her hand me bade one her attendants bring me a chair. the service lasted about an hour, the assemblage dispersed, the natives ran away much pleased so many children let loose school. the close the service, i promised myself so much politeness the part the distinguished personages present, receive some them an invitation go into their houses, i was the uniform a foreign officer; this i was altogether disappointed. i had the satisfaction speaking, a few minutes, mr. bingham, whose attention was soon called me the presence some chief, whom he wished exchange a salutation, after recognizing two three the chiefs present whom i had seen before, i was suffered depart without receiving any further notice. monday, i made a call ceremony the high chief boque, who was one the attendants the late king rio rio, his visit the king england. he was a man about thirty years age, upwards six feet, stout proportion. he had a flat nose thick lips, the general expression his face was benevolence good nature--an expression truly characteristic, according the testimony those who have had an opportunity knowing him well. we found him sitting a chair a table, a desk before him, upon which he was making pot-hooks after a copy, just commenced learning write. he got up shook hands us, did also his wife, who was seated some mats the other end the hut. boque was dressed a coarse linen shirt trowsers, a pair heavy shoes his feet, without any stockings. queen boque was nearly large her husband, looked a good deal like him. she had a plain white muslin cap dress, neither which were very clean neatly put on. was, however, good taste could be expected so rude a state society, i thought less becoming than would have been her native dress. she invited us be seated, made an attempt politeness, such she had seen practised england, accompanied her husband thither. the hut was an oblong building, about sixty forty feet. its simple structure was the same has been use the islands time immemorial, being poles laid over crotches, upon which the rafters rested, differing nothing the habitations the poorest people, except the crotches, poles, rafters, were longer, there were more them. was thatched the top all the way the ground, a thick covering grass. the interior was all one apartment, the top the rafters the hard beaten ground floor. there was nothing ornamental, no superfluous furniture. a bedstead standing one corner, some pieces white tappa cloth the island curtains, whereon was laid a pile mats a bed; two three piles mats laying along near the centre the hut, raised one two feet the floor, being piled one above the other, beds lounging places; two three old chairs; a plain table small dimensions, a dressing-case a mirror it, was all boque's furniture, either useful ornamental. besides these may be mentioned a few hollow gourds poye, (a favourite food the sandwich islanders, made the tarrow,) hanging the side the hut. leaving boque's palace, we went the intention making a similar call upon the high chief crimacu, known strangers who have visited the island, the name billy pitt. he was the high carnie, great friend tamahamaha, whose wars he was greatly distinguished personal prowess, sagacity, wisdom. we came his hut, we found him sleeping a swinging cot, several attendants sitting round, one whom was fanning him. he was very ill health, a long time been afflicted the dropsy, we departed without waking him. his hut differed nothing boque, except was not so large, had a greater profusion mats it. was standing one corner an extensive plain, was partially enclosed a wicker fence just the outskirts the town onaroora, all around was growing wild grass weeds, except the footsteps the people, who passed the hut, had trodden them down. looked little like the habitation a man who had been a great warrior, associated second authority one who had conquered ruled over thousands men. one would naturally suppose emerging a savage state, absolute power, he would have made an attempt, least, imitate the style manners the white men whom he was constantly meeting, always terms friendship. after we had interchanged salutes the shore, chief boque came board the 17th, make us a visit ceremony. he was dressed a splendid english major-general's uniform, made a very handsome appearance. he remained partook a collation us, which several gentlemen were invited meet him, all respects acquitted himself a more polite becoming manner than could have been expected one whose opportunities had been so limited. he drank sparingly wine, left us an early hour, notwithstanding the solicitations the company him remain. a few hours after he had landed, i met him again, should hardly have recognized him his large stature good-natured face. he had stripped himself all his finery, was walking over the plain his house nothing his marrow, a piece tappa cloth the island thrown loosely over his shoulders. i asked him he had taken off his uniform, which he replied, was too warm. our countrymen, vary the entertainments they were constantly giving us, thereby make them the more acceptable, proposed we should make an excursion a valley, called them pearl river, the pearl frequently found a small stream passes through it. horses could not be obtained all, part the company went water, whilst the rest, four five, mounted horseback. the distance was about fifteen miles. i made one the land party, we set off early the afternoon. there was no road, many places not even a footpath. the whole way was over hill dale, through swamps. we had jump fences ditches made through tarrow-patches, ascend narrow paths, difficult dangerous cliffs. all the afternoon was occupied this manner, was sundown we arrived our place destination. one old native made bold oppose us jumping our horses over his fence, was so obstinate his refusal let us pass, a time we thought we should have relinquish our excursion--a reflection not very agreeable, after having advanced more than half way over so wretched a road. finally, all other arguments had failed, some one the party, thinking the native opposed our trespass upon his premises no other object than lay us under contribution, gave him half a dollar, which did more us than all our threats persuasion. instead opposing, he afterwards pointed out us the best way. onavoora pearl river, the country was thinly inhabited. we met no considerable village rich valley. our road lay near the edge a wide marsh, intervened between us the sea, the opposite direction which, an undulating country extended three four miles, was interrupted the high uninhabited range mountains run through the centre the island one end the other. was saturday evening, we arrived pearl river, and, according the doctrine which the missionaries had instructed the sandwich islanders, their sabbath had commenced. the hut we were occupy belonged captain dana, an american gentleman, whom we were indebted many hours agreeable pastime. besides the hut, he possessed other property the valley, which gave him an influence the chief it, enabled him command whatever produced. we arrived, the chief was seated a mat, near captain dana's hut, moody, and, apparently, very stupid. the arrival so many strangers, a place a visiter was scarcely ever seen, produced a lively interest amongst the villagers. all them seemed partake the general excitement, the chief, though celebrated his hospitality, was now sunk the most listless apathy, apparently scarcely sensible our presence. he was told we wanted supper, preparation made our accommodation the morrow, he replied, was the sabbath, neither then nor the morrow could fire be made, was forbidden the almighty. upon being asked he knew was forbidden the almighty, he said, mr. bingham had seen the almighty, who told him so. this was a great check our promised enjoyment, one we were quite unprepared for, no prohibition making fire saturday, any other night, was existence onavoora. we saw a poor prospect getting supper any thing, indeed, until we returned, unless we fasted sunday, our religious scruples did not call for, were not unavoidable. we were unwilling, however, interfere the established observances, which had been thought necessary civilize improve the condition the people, bore our disappointment silence. after wandering about the village a while, which was small, scattered over a sterile ridge, we were relieved our unpleasant dilemma a native, we had taken us cook interpreter, who was commonly known upon the island the name joe banks. he had received some education, had been a convert the missionaries, whom he afterwards seceded. he did not like fasting any more than ourselves, set about haranguing the chief, convince him the error his opinion, respect the making fire. joe was not wanting either talent volubility; and, our great satisfaction, we soon found him good terms the chief; a fire was made, soon after a kid a pig brought up slaughter. i observed, the chief's skin was very rough scales, resembling somewhat the shell a small terrapin. upon inquiring the cause, they told me, was the effect the ava-root, which he was undergoing a course. he had almost finished the course, his skin was all peeling off. was the effect the ava, made him so stupid, under its operation he was a most disgusting looking object. the natives the sandwich islands very much subject cutaneous irruptions, which troublesome, and, long standing, often dangerous. eradicate this, some other offensive diseases, which they afflicted, they sometimes go through a course the ava. taken quantities a gill half a pint, the juice the green root. chewed, the juice spit into a gourd, intended the use another person than the one who prepares it, said, taken, deprive the person muscular power. a few moments after swallowing the potion, he loses the use all his limbs. he experiences an agreeable sensation, conscious every thing transpires, without the power speech. he lies this helpless condition several hours, he recovers his strength a measure, is left the condition a man has been very much intoxicated. this, have the desired effect, is repeated daily about a month; the disease is cured, the skin all comes off, a fair shining one is left its place. once was settled between joe banks the chief pearl river valley, fire should be made, our supper cooked, he provided us the most sumptuous native style. we had pigs, goats, fish, tarrow, potatoes, the greatest profusion. all was cooked after the manner the natives, the same method is practised generally amongst the islanders the pacific ocean, knowing, experience, is a very good one, i here describe it. a hole is first dug a foot two deep, large, according the size the thing be cooked. a fire is then made the hole, and, is burning well, covered over stones a convenient size. every thing is readiness, the stones being well heated, they taken off, the hole cleared out. a layer stones is then placed all round the interior, upon which is lain the meat, after being well wrapped up green leaves. over this is placed a thick layer stones, which is covered grass, something dry, then earth. vegetables be cooked, they lain the top the upper layer stones. the young tops the tarrow usually wrapped up leaves, cooked the meats the manner above described. is a very excellent green, called the natives lewoca, which the method cooking takes its name. early the morning after our arrival, we arose, look upon the wild beauty the valley, wander through what, a distance, appeared be its meadows lawns; but, our great disappointment, descending the hills, the green level fields looked so pleasant a distance, were all cut up tarrow patches, flooded over, intersected every direction ditches embankments. a scene, so uninviting, soon induced us relinquish our anticipated pleasure, return. the course our morning's walk we came the house an englishman, who, a few years previous, arrived the island a peruvian man-of-war, the seamen which had risen upon their officers, ran away the vessel. he had taken himself a native wife, and, all appearance, had fixed here his abode life. his hut looked extremely comfortable--not less so, indeed, than the chief, besides other property he had acquired, he had a fine flock sheep feeding near his residence. he politely invited us into his house, which we declined, we were returning late breakfast. after breakfast we set off our boat visit a small island near the sea shore, there were a great many rabbits. we passed along several miles an inlet the sea, before we came it. was half a mile long, level, overgrown high weeds. the rabbits were so numerous, the island was every perforated their burrows, one more would be found almost every bunch high grass we came to,--so tame, we could frequently take them up our hands. we caught more than a dozen them this way, the short time we remained. some years previous, an old spaniard, the name menini, who had settled onavoora, put one more pairs rabbits upon this small island, prevailed upon the chiefs tabboo them. time they had not been disturbed. after returning our dinner, we all set off our way back onuvoora. vary the scene, i relinquished my horse took passage the boat. we sailed several miles among marshes barren islands, upon a salt water inlet, up which a ship heavy burthen might pass a considerable distance. the whole way was quite void interest. we got the sea, we had a head wind row against all the way. a reef extended out the shore, beyond which we were compelled go, making the distance so great, the evening was far advanced before we got the dolphin. not long after our return pearl river, i set out one day an american gentleman, ascend a high steep mountain, rises back the village, which the natives, many years ago, fortified a few heavy pieces cannon. we crossed the plain, which is a mile a mile a half wide, we came the base the mountain. was seven eight hundred feet high, below, seemed rise almost perpendicular the plain. a winding footpath, however, showed us had long frequently been ascended the natives, encouraged us make the attempt. we had often stop get breath, last accomplished our object, gaining the summit entering upon a small plain. here we found several huts, were occupied the families the men appointed guard this important post, into which we entered obtain leave examine the fortification. the people were very friendly; they not only granted us permission, hospitably proffered us some excellent melons, which were very refreshing after our laborious ascent. there were only three men the fort, one whom, appeared have the command, politely waited upon us our walk round. the guns were mounted a platform, the very edge the precipice overlooked the harbour town. they were thirty-two pound caliber. must have been a work inconceivable labour the natives get them upon this great eminence. the carriages all their fixtures were very much decayed, totally unfit use. the situation is very commanding, notwithstanding the distance, the battery would be formidable an enemy the harbour. this eminence, we had an extensive beautiful prospect, comprehending the valley harbour, many miles sea, along the sea-coast either direction. the river, waters the valley, broken cataracts rapidly descended the sea, showed its greatest advantage, the valley, covered its tarrow patches, corn, potatoes, presented a landscape resembling finely cultivated fields waving green meadows. front, was the thatched village onavoora, the huts looking like heaps dry straw; beyond it, the harbour shipping; still farther, sea, a long range white foaming breakers. the extreme right, was the valley pearl river, bounded high rugged mountains; the left, the cocoa-nut groves whytete diamond rock, its adjacent sterile hills, covered volcanic cinders. the top the hill, we descended a different direction our return, a view passing through a part the valley runs far back the shore between the mountains, appeared be finely cultivated well inhabited. we had not gone far the fort, we found ourselves near the centre what had been the crater a volcano, which, its resemblance, has given the eminence the name the punch bowl, which is familiarly known amongst foreigners. the crater is about a quarter half a mile diameter, one two hundred feet deep. we descended the valley, which was not without difficulty, our way was every interrupted tarrow patches, their ditches, embankments. after crossing a small valley, we came an elevated piece ground, the natives who cultivated the tarrow below, had built their habitations, around them planted groves banana. was a fine morning, the people both sexes were industriously engaged their appropriate occupations. some the women were roasting tarrow, others making up poye. the latter operation was interesting me, i had never seen before. the tarrow is roasted, the skin taken off, resembles a potatoe; is then put into a tray, a long, smooth stone, beaten up fine possible, occasionally mixing a small quantity water it; after has been beaten this way, is worked over a number times, get all the lumps out; then has the appearance a thick paste starch. a soon it foments a little becomes slightly acid, it is used. this state, it not last long before it becomes very sour, is then considered so unwholesome, unless the people very poor, it is thrown away. after satisfying our curiosity seeing the women make poye, we descended the hill several men were preparing a tarrow patch. it was forty feet square, excavated a little, an embankment two feet high thrown up all around it, descending a considerable angle the top the base, making it very broad the bottom. the labourers had advanced thus far, were beating the area inner sides the embankment broad heavy paddles, going over it a great many times. it appeared very hard firm we saw them work; still, they told us, they had beat it a great deal more. this is completed, the tops the tarrow have been cut off the purpose, set the ground lightly flooded water; after it has taken root began grow thriftily, more water is let upon it; the tarrow well grown, generally be covered water the depth one two feet. it is about the size a beet, takes a year more come its greatest perfection. it has clusters broad bright green leaves, shape appearance a good deal like the common pond lilly. it is a very nutricious vegetable, constitutes the principal means subsistence the sandwich islanders. the huts the natives were very small, although the midst cultivation fertility, the inhabitants seemed be wretchedly poor. they did not appear much more civilized than the natives the marquesas; their habitations were certainly less comfortable. returning the village, we saw a number people scraping sticks looked like our elder, preserving the inner bark. upon inquiring its use, they told us it was catch fish with. eaten the fish, they come the top the water taken out hand. it is said, the fish not the worse this. our arrival oahoo, the dolphin was out repair every respect, it was indispensably necessary refit her, before we proceeded further our return the coast chili peru. whilst the masts were out, the vessel was undergoing general repairs, the captain received a letter captain edwards, the ship loudon, new-york, stating he had ran upon a reef, the island ranai; besides a valuable cargo, he had a large amount specie bullion board. the chief thunder, (chief ranai,) was encouraging the natives the island plunder him, finally, his life treasure was the greatest jeopardy. although not incumbent upon him a duty, captain percival, a promptitude highly creditable himself the service which he belonged, chartered a vessel, the crew the dolphin, boque, the governor oahoo, sailed the same day he received the letter. he found the situation captain edwards not less critical than he had described it be. the natives had already plundered him a part his cargo, his own crew was a state mutiny. employing the authority chief boque, the indefatigable industry his own crew, captain percival caused the stolen goods be restored, the cargo treasure the loudon be safely landed oahoo. all this had been accomplished, captain edwards refused pay the charter the vessel was employed his relief, consequence which, a quarrel arose between himself captain percival, eventuated consequences injurious disagreeable both parties, after our return home, became a subject judicial investigation. this investigation, which was brought the instance captain edwards, an opportunity was afforded captain percival the officers the dolphin, vindicate their characters, which they did, every instance, the entire satisfaction their government countrymen. whilst captain percival was absent ranai, captain jackson, the brig harbinger, boston, addressed a letter me, stating his store the village had been broken open, robbed goods a large amount, requesting my assistance recover them. the matter was laid before the chief, crimacu, who instituted a search, the following day, sent captain jackson. his hut, were assembled most the foreigners any respectability the island, many the natives witness the result the inquiry. some the thieves had already been detected, now stood before the chief, who, although very ill, sat up question them about the robbery. they confessed their guilt, answering the questions put them, convicted others, who were sent brought in, until the number amounted six. they had shared their booty, were sent out, guards, bring it their different places concealment. it consisted, principally, fine calicoes cloths, which had been put tarrow patches, oil casks, returned, were so damaged, be little value the owner. the chief got through the inquiry, had collected all the goods could be found, he asked mr. jackson what punishment he would have inflicted upon the offenders. mr. jackson's reply was, he wanted restitution made the loss he had sustained, he would leave the punishment the chief, according the usage the islands. the chief contended the men were all poor, had nothing wherewith pay. he said the chiefs were also poor, denied the justice compelling them, under any circumstances, pay the thefts the people. he offered put the culprits captain jackson's disposal, inflict upon them whatever punishment he should prescribe, according the laws his own country. captain jackson refused say what punishment the men should receive, only contended the chief was bound see his property, an equivalent, restored him. the matter was, some hours debate, the chief compromised captain jackson, promising have a quantity sandal-wood collected him within a prescribed period. the thieves were set liberty without punishment, consequence which, it was surmised some our countrymen, the chiefs had been concerned the theft. this, i thought, a very unjust suspicion, the investigation took place so publicly, the fact, it had been so, could hardly have failed appear the course the inquiry. the magnanimity crimacu,[14] promising an equivalent the damaged goods, which he was not bound the customs the sandwich islands, the laws civilized communities, gave me the highest opinion his character. it appeared me he first objected remunerate the merchant his loss, no other motive than produce discussion, which he might learn what would be done more enlightened countries, a similar case. he was told the different punishments the culprits would be subject under the laws america england, nothing could be advanced, even supposing he was act accordance the laws those countries, prove the chiefs king the islands, were any other way responsible the thefts committed individuals, than make them stand forth suffer person their offences. he remarked, the information he received individuals the same country, respect their laws customs, was often variance, so contradictory, he was frequently a loss know what he should do answer the ends justice, give satisfaction the strangers who came the islands. he declared, the chiefs the sandwich islands, wished do like other people. amongst those whom we held frequent friendly intercourse, was an englishman, the name wilkinson, who had taken passage the sandwich islands, the frigate blonde, she went there the remains king rio rio, who had banished himself his own country this distant region, a view becoming a planter the sandwich islands. he had been, according his own statement, a planter the west indies early life, subsequently his return england, joined a troop horse, which he was a captain, destined spain, during the war the peninsula, he served a considerable time, the close the war, having left the army, met a reverse fortune, he had determined make the experiment which he was now engaged. a bold one, it must be confessed, a man, the age forty-five, an enfeebled constitution. aided captain byron, (who, his high rank, the flattering mission upon which he had been sent, was well prepared assist him,) mr. wilkinson obtained the chiefs the first deed ever was granted them, two hundred acres land. it was situated about six miles onavoora, elevated ground, bordering upon a narrow valley winds through the mountains several miles back the sea. the chiefs granted the deed great reluctance, notwithstanding the respectable source which the petition came, being extremely tenacious command sovereignty the soil, enables them, pleasure, dispossess the occupant. they the more willingly relinquished the spot mr. wilkinson had fixed upon his residence, it was situated upon land so high, it could not be used the culture tarrow, was the time unoccupied. uncommon industry, although cramped the want money, would have given it its full effect, he had reclaimed a wild state, about fifty acres land, which, we arrived there, was planted sugar-cane, corn, potatoes, bananas, &c., thus providing his immediate wants, whilst the cane promised a rich harvest, would amply reward him his toil, whenever he could complete his machinery the manufacture sugar. this, however, all appearance we were there, he would encounter great difficulty, materials were not easily obtained; although there were some mechanics the island, their constant employment the village, they could frequently see their countrymen, withal, their fondness pleasure was likely deprive him a long time their useful services, without which, he could do nothing. connected his land, was a stream water running the mountains, would answer his purpose manufacturing sugar. a part it possessed all local advantages, he had made a dam collected part the materials a mill, be constructed the simplest manner, which, the want mechanical aid, lay almost the same rude state which he had purchased them. he anticipated, however, great confidence, the time the cane was ready cutting, the mill would be prepared, the hopes which he had first been stimulated, could scarcely fail be realized. the sugar cane grows wild upon the sandwich islands, mr. wilkinson's fields were the native growth, which he had planted prepared land, our departure, the canes were upwards six feet high. although several strangers, familiar the arts civilized countries, have settled lived, many years, amongst the sandwich islanders, mr. wilkinson was the first individual who ever attempted put them practice, upon a scale, sufficiently extensive improve, materially, the agricultural condition the islands, thereby prove the inhabitants the wealth they possess, a rich soil, one the finest climates the face the globe. should mr. wilkinson be successful, the result his experiment probably do more towards the civilization the natives, their ultimate advancement knowledge lasting prosperity, than has yet been effected all the white men have lived amongst them. this, i am aware, be considered a rash assertion the good people our country, who, the best motives, feel deeply engaged foreign missions, and, expressing this opinion, i also bear testimony the useful services the missionaries. the best information i could obtain upon the subject, i am satisfied, they have improved the morals the people, they devote themselves the schools they have established, introducing the arts life civilization, the time may not be distant, the natives be prepared receive christianity. their present condition, would it not be better, more the true spirit benevolence philanthropy which is inspired our religion, teach them cultivate their land, introduce grain fruits, congenial the climate, plant reap we do, rather than imbue their minds a mysterious doctrine, which, being beyond their comprehension, must resolve itself into a dark intolerant superstition. the inhabitants the sandwich islands, mild, amiable, intelligent, susceptible the highest degree moral intellectual improvement. a people, it may be said, the stamp civilization is scarcely perceptible yet upon them; it is now inevitable, they must bear the impress those, whom our philanthropists have sent convert them christianity; and, whether they become ignorant zealots, intelligent christians, will depend upon their teachers. the situation these missionaries is, therefore, one high responsibility, ought not, christian charity, be occupied the narrow-minded fanatic, the ignorant zealot. it is the first importance they, who dispose the vast means the missionary society, should select only such men civilizing christianizing the sandwich islanders, distinguished their knowledge, love the useful arts life, well practical piety. the harbour onavoora, is a place general rendezvous the whale ships, cruising the coast japan, the vicinity the islands. the months january, february, march, being the least favourable their business, they then leave their cruising ground, go search refreshment. no place is so convenient them the sandwich islands, the port onavoora, being the most commodious any the group, affording an abundant supply vegetables, hogs, &c.,--they all congregate there the months above mentioned. the average number visit the island the course the year, is upwards fifty. more than twenty were there together, several different periods our stay, some which remained a few days, some weeks, a few one two months, according their several necessities. such times the seamen, having been long confined the narrow precinct their vessels, become very insubordinate, frequently give way the most licentious indulgences their passions, regardless every obligation obedience due their officers. we witnessed frequent instances this kind, had the satisfaction being constantly useful the captains ships, the whaling interest, restraining the violent, coercing them a proper sense duty. a most unpleasant occurrence took place about six weeks after our arrival at onavoora, arising this disposition the seamen, other causes, which was afterwards greatly misrepresented this country. some the seamen the dolphin, who were liberty, got into a frolic, and, associating themselves many others belonging the whale ships, determined go the houses the high chiefs missionaries, demand the repeal a restriction deprived them the society females. they produced a riot gave rise a considerable degree excitement a few minutes; captain percival, some the officers the dolphin, captains whale-ships, promptly suppressed it, prevented any serious outrage. it was afterwards unjustly most ungenerously ascribed the officers the dolphin. the white population onavoora is a varied character, the agent our north west traders, the most abandoned members society. there fifty a hundred, permanently settled at onavoora; the least respectable whom, maintain themselves keeping tippling shops tor sailors, practising such chicaneries suggested opportunities the absence law. the season the whalers visit the island is the time their harvest, when, besides their gains entertaining the seamen, they frequently prevail upon them desert the sake the reward their apprehension, strip them what little money clothes they may be possessed of. some them have married women the island, live much the same way the natives. all the permanent settlers at onavoora, the most remarkable was a spaniard the name meninne, who had been the islands upwards thirty years. his manner getting there, a variety stories were told. his own account was, being invited board a vessel visited the coast california, he fell asleep the evening, and, he awoke, found himself at sea, the vessel running, a fair wind, the sandwich islands. all his entreaties be returned land were vain, he arrived at owhyhee, where, poor friendless, he was landed amongst the natives. he wandered island island, a forlorn wretched condition, until he was taken under the patronage tamahamaha. a long time, he followed the fortunes the native warrior, at length fixed his residence at oahoo, whence he occasionally embarked interpreter board merchant vessels, bound smuggling voyages the coast america. after passing through a variety fortune, being several times made prisoner threatened death, he finally quitted his vagrant life, remained permanently at oahoo, where, great industry economy, he has acquired an amount property which, place, is a princely fortune. besides having money the united states england, he owns nearly all the cattle the island oahoo, a number horses, flocks goats, sheep, &c. he has extensive possessions land, which he holds the chiefs consideration his services, a great many houses. he has taken some pains introduce exotics the islands, besides the lemon, orange, other valuable fruits, has a vineyard which he makes a considerable quantity wine annually. he is said be extremely selfish, so jealous preserving himself a monopoly these valuable fruits, he has been accused destroying the young plants others. he is considered ranking amongst the chiefs the enjoyment certain privileges; and, speaking the language the islands well, is called upon interpreter the government upon all important occasions. he has had thirty-seven children various wives, is yet the prime life. like most men who have felt the cold hand poverty, afterwards acquired wealth, he is extremely penurious, thinks nothing so much adding his fortune without knowing enjoy it. the 3d april, the young king all the high chiefs, were invited board spend the day us. the morning, we dressed the schooner all the flags we could muster, made the best preparation our limited accommodation would admit receive our distinguished guests. no indication their appearance was seen some time after every thing was readiness, our boats shore waiting, we were kept suspense until we had almost despaired seeing them. all at once the whole town was an uproar, the people were running hallooing every direction. the young king advance, walked arm arm one the officers the dolphin. next came boque his spouse, other high dignitaries, the rear a multitude people both sexes all ages. they had embarked, the eyes the people were turned upon another object, not less interesting them than the king. crimacu, billy pitt, too ill walk, was gravely making his way the beach a hand cart, he got into a boat came board soon after the king. we received them manned yards, a salute twenty-one guns. the king, who was a boy ten twelve years old, was dressed a military uniform was sent him the king england, upon his shoulders he wore a pair golden epaulets, crowns them. he appeared be sensible his rank, and, upon two three occasions, addressed his attendants a way that indicated a wish make a display his authority. the chiefs conducted themselves towards him a becoming respect, without bestowing upon him any attention that might interfere their own enjoyment convenience. instead partaking what we had provided our guests, they, one two exceptions, unceremoniously uncovered their poye pots, which had been brought them an attendant, ate heartily their favourite food, using their fingers is the native custom. boque again displayed his major general's uniform, was amongst the most polished our guests. after passing a number hours board, they returned the shore delighted their visit. the same compliment was paid them at their reception. it was a day great enjoyment the common people. they received their chiefs landing loud huzzas, followed them crowds their respective habitations. we passed all the winter months at onavoora, during which we had frequent heavy rains. some the storms were attended violent gales, disagreeably cold weather. about the 3d may, an influenza made its appearance amongst the inhabitants oahoo, two days not a well native was any be seen. the market, being well attended, was deserted. a week, the distress was so general so great, that it was feared the poor people would perish hunger. i visited several families, not a member which was able help himself others, all were totally destitute food. a great many the people died, amongst the rest two chiefs, one whom was george tamauri, a native the island atooi, who was educated this country. the other was cahaliha, next affinity the king. scarcely any the white people were affected. not even those living shore. about ten days, the people the country began make their appearance the market, the distress was greatly alleviated, soon afterwards the general good health restored. at such times suffering, the condition these people is truly wretched. they have no floor their huts the hard-beaten ground which their naked bodies separated only two three thin mats, during the rainy season the earth becomes perfectly saturated water. their huts generally built a very frail manner, a driving storm are not proof against the rain. this, alone, is sufficient account the thinly populated state the islands, without charging the natives the acts inhumanity that have been ascribed them some people. the harbour onavoora is formed coral reefs, that extend upwards a mile the shore. the entrance it is narrow somewhat difficult. it affords water enough a sloop war. a pilot out the harbour, is always employed. it is very secure, being quite land locked. the holding ground is good, vessels may lay safety close along side the beach. the water is perfectly smooth good weather, the bottom shores being nearly every soft mud, a vessel might be driven upon them a gale without sustaining any material injury. the visits the numerous whale ships has made onavoora a place considerable trade. all them spend more less money their necessary refreshments, out repair, their disbursements are frequently very considerable. the supplies afforded the natives, thousands dollars are annually received them, which they give return silk, cotton, calicoes, cloth, &c. two three stores, well stocked a great variety goods, are supported onavoora this interchange commodities; and, the way which the trade is conducted, there is little doubt that the proprietors are rewarded handsome profits. the sandal wood has become scarce upon the islands, the large quantities formerly taken away our traders, does not now form a very lucrative extensive article commerce. upon this article, some our merchants are said have made large sums money exchange whole cargoes goods, the chiefs the sandwich islands. it is related tamahamaha, that, after making a purchase this kind, which he paid ship loads sandal wood, brought the mountains great labour himself people, he has been known load a number canoes secretly at night, fine broadcloths, take them out sea, he sunk them stones. his only reason it was, that the possession them would make his chiefs people too luxurious idle, bringing sandal wood the mountains pay more, would give them employment. a doubtful policy, certainly, the statement be true. be this as it may, himself successor have entailed upon their descendants a national debt several hundred thousands dollars, now due our merchants, which they will not soon be able liquidate. the 11th may, after long anticipating our much wished departure, we got underway, saluting the fort as we passed it twenty-one guns, stood out sea shaped our course chili. nothing material transpired the time our sailing until the 7th june, standing along a fresh trade, the night dark squally, at 10 p.m., the lookout-ahead reported land close aboard. we tacked lay the night, survey our newly discovered island the following morning. at daylight, it bore s.s.w., about six miles us, appeared three small hummocs, covered thickly trees bushes, every bounded a coral reef heavy surf. we hesitated some time whether we should land, apprehending that it would be attended too much risk, merely the gratification curiosity; this feeling operated so powerfully upon us, that there was no resisting the desire land no one had ever been before. accordingly, two boats were sent off, watching a favourable opportunity passed through the surf safety, landed the coral bank they were left high dry the receding wave. it was the lee side the island, a coral reef stretched off about fifty a hundred yards the shore, full holes, almost dry at low water. the holes we sought fish, as at caroline island, found very few. traversing the island, we could find no fruit vegetable any description except bup. most places it was covered trees bushes a thick growth, almost impenetrable. the bushes we found a great many tropical birds setting, so tame that we could take them off their nests our hands, getting upon the weather side the island there was a clear space, we found a species small gull, so numerous, that when they rose the ground at our approach, they appeared form almost a compact mass. the sand was literally covered their eggs, which, upon examination, proved be unfit use, few exceptions. the birds flew hovered so near us that we caught several them our hands. after amusing ourselves a little while the novel spectacle such numbers birds so very tame, we collected all the old eggs within a small space, less than twenty minutes after it had been thus cleared, it was again covered fresh eggs the birds that were constantly lighting. we might, a few hours, have loaded our boats them. when we returned our boats go board, the tide had risen, it the surf had increased an alarming degree. at first, we held a consultation whether we should attempt pass through it remain until it should again subside the falling the tide; the day was far advanced, the appearance the weather such, as all probability would render our situation extremely painful, there being every prospect an increase wind. we therefore determined put our fortune the test, were not a little discouraged when one the boats attempting the surf was thrown back the second roller that she encountered the utmost violence, upsetting her, scattering the people different directions, some them escaping their lives the greatest difficulty. notwithstanding the ill success our first attempt, we determined a second, rather than risk the consequences longer delay. embracing a favourable opportunity the surf appeared least violent, we put off, passed through it safety without further accident. the island was little more than a mile long, a hundred yards a quarter a mile wide. it was every very low. a meridian observation, we placed the north-west end it latitude south 21 degrees 48 minutes, longitude chronometer 154 degrees 54 minutes west. compliment the commander our squadron the pacific ocean, we called it hull's island. it may be comprehended within the group society islands. the afternoon, june the 4th, we made sail; the following day at half-past 6 o'clock, a.m. discovered the island ramitaria, the lee bow, about eight leagues us. this island was not laid down any our charts, having been discovered only three four years before; we had seen a gentlemen who had stopped there, it was included our list islands. approaching it we were pleased find that it differed many the islands we had visited, being a moderate elevation. it is about three miles long one two wide. we ran nearly round it before we found a place land, the surf breaking high every where, the shores bounded large rocks coral. at last, we came the principal settlement, which was situated close the shore, a large white-washed house indicated the former visits influences the missionaries. the people, the number one two hundred, were assembled the beach inviting us land. here, also, was a considerable surf some coral rocks, which made the landing not altogether free difficulty. when the boat came near the shore while she was yet shooting rapidly through the surf, the natives, who had already advanced meet us, laid hold as many as could get round her, loud shouting, carried us high upon the beach. at this somewhat unexpected reception, the boat's crew instinctively seized their pistols, thinking at first, that the natives were hostile their disposition towards us. it was a momentery panic which passed away the kind salutations we immediately afterwards received. when i enquired the chief, a young man was pointed out me the crowd, distinguished the rest an old hat his head, that he had obtained some former visiter. he seemed not be treated the least respect the people, who jostled him the crowd the most perfect carelessness. scarcely had i addressed him, when a stout native came up an air some importance, saluting me, told me the language the society islands, that he was the missionary. upon his approach, the chief immediately shrunk back into the crowd. he called him a malay, who was not far off, bade him ask what we wanted. the malay, whose name was manoo, spoke english very well, which was a source great satisfaction us, as we could thereby communicate our wants freely, it introduced us at once each others' acquaintance. i explained manoo that we were want water such refreshments as the island might afford. he immediately proceeded company the missionary show me water was be obtained. we passed through a forest very large trees over a plain that extended more than half a mile, when we came a marsh reeds rank grass, there was one two feet water, covering an area two three acres. this would not answer our purpose as the water was not very good, its distance the place embarkation rendered it too laborious an undertaking water the vessel it. when i had remarked this manoo the missionary, they replied that there was better water, but it was still more distant. i suffered them conduct me it, we took a footpath over rising ground, through another delightful forest bread-fruit other wide-spreading trees, passing many fine tarrow patches, at the distance half a mile the marsh, we came a spring excellent water. manoo the missionary both expressed a great deal disappointment when i spoke terms disapprobation this also as a watering-place--it being altogether too far the shore. our return the spring, we took a different footpath that which we came, ascended a more elevated part the island see the work the missionary, as it was called manoo. this consisted two three enclosures means stakes, the midst the forest, the trees had been cut down several acres, which was cleared planted sweet potatoes tobacco. the enclosures were made, all the labour clearing the forest was done, as manoo remarked, such the wicked disobedient, as had resisted the authority ordinances the white missionary during his residence the island some months previous. since then, the white missionary had returned otaheite, sent this native missionary, who belonged that island, represent him his absence. leaving the enclosures tobacco sweet potatoes, we came into a thicket the trees were overrun the vines the yam, growing wild covered beautiful blue flowers that gave a picturesque appearance the forest, filled it their fragrance. we passed five six stone columns that had been sixty seventy feet high, twenty thirty circumference. they were a dilapidated state, having part been thrown down order the missionaries. manoo told me that they were monuments erected in honour the indian god. several these ruins were standing the side an old burial-place in the edge the woods near the shore. each the graves were neatly enclosed with a wall stone. when we returned the village, i was taken a large frame building called the missionary house, the missionary had prepared a roasted pig some tarrow, our dinner. he designed entertain me after the manner the whites, with this view, had placed our repast a large coarse table that stood in the middle the room with benches round it. when we were seated, he unlocked a chest took it a plate each us, a knife fork, all which were extremely dirty, the knives forks quite covered with rust. this, however, he did not seem remark, although he evidently wished me think that he knew be polite, after the fashion my country people. he acquitted himself pretty well, his own satisfaction, until he attempted use the knife fork--but that was altogether too much him. after making several trials in vain cut his meat, he asked me assist him; finally, before he had half finished his dinner, laid down his clumsy instruments used his fingers. the chief, as many the natives as could get into the room came round us, but none them were invited partake with the missionary myself, except manoo, whilst the hungry crowd stood looking wistfully at us. soon after we had finished our dinner, the captain several the officers landed, we exchanged several articles with the natives their pigs, yams, &c. the following day was their sabbath our saturday, they insisted that we should remain until monday, before any exchange commodities took place. when, however, we declared our determination depart that evening, they began collecting whatever might be acceptable us. hogs various sizes, were brought the beach in great numbers. needles, jack-knives, old clothes, were our articles traffic, than which we could have offered them nothing more valuable. sundown, we had collected thirty forty hogs, a good supply yams. in a few hours more, we might have obtained twice as many upon the same terms. towards the close the day, when the missionary felt assured that it was our determination depart, he asked if i was a doctor, had any skill in medicine; and, although i replied in the negative, insisted upon my going his house see, prescribe his wife, who, he told me, was extremely ill. upon entering his hut, we found her laying a mat the floor; notwithstanding the weather was oppressively warm, she was covered over with a great many pieces the tappa cloth, head all, perspiring most profusely. the missionary, with great gravity, but most unceremoniously, removed all the covering, pointed out me her infirmity, which was nothing more than a common bile, with which she seemed be suffering considerable pain. i declined prescribing, although repeatedly requested do so; at sun-down, we embarked made sail. had it been convenient us remain two days longer at ramitarias, we could have obtained an abundant supply whatever the island produced, a very trifling consideration; but although there was anchorage, it was unsheltered, too near the shore us ride in safety. at six, p.m. the 10th june, we took our departure ramitarias; at day-light, the 13th, made the island toubouai, bearing the northward eastward, about eight leagues us. in getting in with the s.w. part the island, we found an extensive reef, upon which the surf was breaking with great violence. we hauled round the east side, passing two small uninhabited islands, but there was not the slightest appearance a landing-place, the surf breaking heavily as far as we could see. at four, p.m. we anchored the north side, in seven fathoms water, sent boats in search the harbour, along the west shore. in the evening, they returned, having found it, the following morning, we got underway, beat up it. when we had advanced near the opening, through the coral reefs that extend from the shore several miles, a mr. strong, an american, came board, piloted us in through a difficult passage. the channel was narrow, very crooked; but we had not less than three a half fathoms water. our anchorage was within a coral reef, about a mile from the shore, in four a half fathoms. the day previous entering the harbour, we discovered that the head our mainmast was decayed, badly sprung. in this situation, we congratulated ourselves in having found a secure harbour, the water was tolerably smooth, which was very essential in fixing the mast securely. nearly all the inhabitants toubouai, consisting about two hundred, were living the side the island we were anchored, in two different settlements. one them was the residence two otaheite missionaries, who governed in spiritual temporal affairs; at the other, was the residence the king, who, since the coming the missionaries, retained but a small share the power that formerly appertained his station. he lived apparently good terms with the missionaries, fearing their influence with the people, but secretly declaring his aversion them. he was the more afraid offending them, as there was a living example their displeasure constantly before him, in the person one who had formerly exercised the regal authority in the missionary village, which they had divested him disobedience, compelled him live in the condition a common private person. soon after the arrival the missionaries, the people became divided into two parties, one which advocated matrimony, the other the unrestrained indulgence which is practised in a state nature. the first, called themselves the missionary party; the latter, the party the tutiori. after a long struggle the ascendency, the tutiories took up arms retired from the habitable part the island, declaring themselves independent the missionaries. they remained several days undisturbed in their disobedience, when a party was sent bring them terms. the tutiories at first retreated, but finally made a stand, after a slight show resistance, submitted, promising go home live in the observance the missionary precepts. the dethroned king, was at the head the tutiories. at the lower village, as it was called us, the king lived, was a party our countrymen, who had been there a number months building a vessel. they had completed the frame commenced planking, when, unfortunately, a quarrel arose between them the people the missionary village, which terminated in open hostility, the loss several lives. one the white men only, was killed. scarcely had they made peace with the natives, when they quarrelled among themselves, nearly half their number (four five) discontinued their work, waited only an opportunity leave the island. this mutinous disposition a few, paralized the efforts the whole party, it was probable from appearances, that the labour they had bestowed with so much effect, would be entirely lost themselves their employer, captain dana massachusetts, whom we had seen at oahoo. the king myself, became high carnies, (or great friends) the day after our arrival; from that time until our departure, he did everything in his power merit my regard. my mess was constantly supplied with bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, tarrow, bananas; whenever i was shore, he waited upon me everywhere with the most friendly attention. our friendship commenced in the following manner, simple enough, it is true, but i believe it was not the less sincere that account. seeing me with a jack-knife in my hand, he expressed a wish look at it, when i told him that he might have it. he received it, after observing me a moment, put his hand upon my arm remarked, now i will be high carnies. i sincerely reciprocated his kindness, so strongly recommended the disinterested simplicity with which it was proffered. two three days after our arrival, i landed with a view traversing the island. i found king dick, as i used call him, upon a bank coral that stretched out from his house, with a long wooden spear in his hand, looking about in the holes fish. he begged me wait until he had taken one his dinner, he would accompany me. accordingly, having succeeded in a few minutes afterwards, we set off together. the island was two three miles wide, we had not proceeded far, when we came an extensive marsh that runs through the middle it. king dick stopped, insisted upon carrying me over on his back. feeling that it was too menial an office to be performed a king, although an untutored native, i remonstrated with him, positively refused to be carried; but after resisting his importunity some time, he took my musket in his hand, i mounted on his shoulders. the marsh was several hundred yards wide, king dick found his burthen very heavy before he landed me on the opposite side. we there entered upon a romantic extensive plain, covered with cocoa-nut, bread-fruit trees, plantain walks, papayas, &c.; interspersed through which, were numerous huts that appeared to have been long deserted. we traversed this plain miles, with little variation; the same pleasing prospect everywhere presenting itself, when suddenly king dick stopped, made the whole forest ring with the shrill notes his voice. after repeating it several times, he was answered at a distance, soon afterwards, we saw a native making his approaches towards us. king dick said something to him, he ascended a cocoa-nut tree, after the manner the people the marquesas, threw down a sufficient quantity nuts to quench our thirst. he afterwards conducted us to a house there were two women several children. they were delighted to see us, hospitably proffered whatever they had refreshment. they gave us a preparation dried bread-fruit, which king dick ate very heartily, but to me it was scarcely palatable. near the house there were several citron lemon trees, the only ones that i saw on the island. in our route back, we met with large quantities sugar cane in a wild state. we passed the burial-place the village, where, beside two three newly made graves, were rudely carved images placed there in conformity to a native custom, that had not yet been abolished the influence the missionaries. when we arrived at king dick's house, we found dinner waiting us. it consisted the fish he had taken in the morning before our departure, roasted fowls, bread-fruit, tarrow, &c. the whole was wrapped up in plantain leaves, placed on a mat upon the floor, around which, we all seated ourselves, there being a number visiters present. during our repast, king dick went frequently to a large chest, he kept a bottle rum i had given him, and, after proffering me the bottle, he would help himself, lock it up in the chest again, without taking the least notice the rest his visiters. no miser ever guarded his treasure more penuriously than the king did his bottle rum; not only on this, but all other occasions. his house was large, a lounging place all the idle people his village; and, although there were always a number present when i made my visits, he never failed to offer me a portion his favourite beverage, the wistful lookers-on received not the slightest notice. i once ventured to propose to him to give some to his friends, but he said no, it was too good them. when, after a week's stay at toubouai, our departure was spoken of, king dick expressed the liveliest regret, proposed going with us. we told him that he would never be able to get back again; to which he replied, that he should not care about returning. the day before we left, he sent me, on board, an abundant sea-stock, fruits vegetables, a good-sized hog. as a parting gift, i dressed him up in an old uniform mine, that seemed to give him infinite pleasure. to his presents, his wife added several pieces the tappa cloth, some which, were as fine specimens the native manufacture, as i ever met with anywhere. at toubouai, we added considerably to our collection curiosities. the most ingeniously wrought article, was a lash, used the natives brushing the flies off their backs. the handles were carved to represent a man's face, some animal familiar to them. the lash itself, was, in several strands, finely braided from twine the cocoa-nut husk. the natives were, in general, naked, except a wrapper round their waists, had a sickly feeble look. the island is very fertile, producing, in many parts, large quantities cocoa-nut bread-fruit, is capable, without further improvement, sustaining some thousands people. the population has greatly diminished within the recollection recent visiters. it must have been much greater when visited the mutineers the bounty, who built a fort on the island, but afterwards became dissatisfied, left it in consequence the treacherous hostile character the natives. the only survivor those guilty men, who is now the patriarch pitcairn's island, states, that they had war with the natives previous to leaving toubouai, that they killed a great many them. his estimate the inhabitants at that time, is fifteen thousand. king dick told me, that the huts we saw on the side the island opposite to where we anchored, were once inhabited people who were all dead. we obtained wood water a good quality, without much labour. hogs were scarce, we got none but what were presented to us. the natives gave us a few domestic fowls, in exchange for writing paper. the paper was used the women for making paste-board for a bonnet, that had just been introduced amongst them the wives the otaheite missionaries. on the island toubouai, there is a tree, the bark which, makes excellent cordage. it is produced in great abundance, grows to the size six eight inches in diameter. after the ship builders were interrupted in their work, the discontent some the party, the remainder made a rope-walk, devoted themselves to making rope this bark. they had several small cables, a considerable quantity rope. we purchased some, found it to wear nearly, quite, as well as hemp. arrow root, grows spontaneously upon the island, has been taken away several vessels, as an article commerce. we were informed that the scarcity hogs was in consequence a great many having been carried off recently, a vessel belonging to the missionaries. also, that they lay all the small islands under contribution, annually send their small vessels to collect the hogs, which they barrel, send to port jackson. this may be true not. it was positively asserted. our stock bread was nearly exhausted, what remained, was in a damaged state. having failed in all our attempts to obtain a supply yams, that would enable us to reach the coast south america, an examination was held upon the bread, to the end, that we might adopt such expedients as should be deemed most proper. valparaiso, was our most direct port; there was but one inhabited island (oparro,) in our way, that at some distance from a straight course. to avoid, however, so disagreeable a circumstance as being without bread, we determined to touch at oparro, get whatever we could for a substitute. accordingly, we put to sea on the 22d june, on the 25th, made oparro, a little before day-light, five leagues from us. when we came near, its appearance was rude inhospitable in the extreme, being a mass rugged mountains, about a thousand feet high, eight ten miles in circumference. on the north-west side, there were no signs inhabitants. the mountains rose almost perpendicularly from the ocean, we sounded frequently, close to the shore, without getting bottom. in rounding the island, to the northward eastward, we opened a valley, where there was a number huts, some patches tarrow. a boat was sent in shore, two the natives came on board, who informed us that there was a harbour to the eastward. we continued on, after landing at one two other small valleys, where there were huts tarrow patches, opened a beautiful deep bay, that had an appearance great fertility. soon afterwards, an englishman came on board, offered to pilot us in. he had not advanced far with the vessel, before she grounded on a bank coral, but fell off immediately, on putting the helm down throwing all aback. we were everywhere surrounded shoals coral, fearful accidents, came to outside the harbour, where we had ten fathoms water on one side, five on the other. the boats were sent off immediately, in search tarrow. it was planted everywhere, in large patches, where there was a small valley, through which a stream water found its way from the mountains to the sea, at a distance, the hills were green with another species we had not before seen, called mountain tarrow. the latter is superior to the low land tarrow, will keep longer at sea. when we landed in the bay, which was several miles deep, we found two different missionary establishments, occupied natives otaheite. no one else, that we saw, seemed to have any authority. they permitted us to dig as much tarrow as we pleased, without asking any return for it, night, we had as much on board as we knew what to do with. one the missionary establishments was situated at the extreme depth the bay. on landing there, i was met the missionaries themselves, conducted to their house, where their wives, who were also from otaheite, received me, dressed in their own island costume, with large straw bonnets on their heads. after remaining with them for a few minutes, i repaired to the place where the boats' crew were employed in collecting tarrow. a group natives, male female, had assembled round, none whom, could be prevailed upon the rewards we offered them, to assist our people in their occupation. they had a sickly look, almost without an exception. their dress differed altogether from any we had before seen. it consisted a heavy mat grass, weighing from ten to fifteen pounds, which was thrown over their shoulders, another light mat the same material, for the loins. their deportment was modest retiring, they evinced a disposition to have but little intercourse with us. a few their houses were scattered about upon the hills. they were extremely miserable, might, without disparagement, be compared to dog kennels. they were long, very narrow, about three four feet high, so that when one entered them, it was necessary to get down upon the hands knees. the otaheite missionaries were distinguished from the natives, wearing the tappa cloth, their own island, an old cloth jacket they had obtained from white visiters. i added something to their stock clothes, before i took leave them, for which, they gave me many thanks. when i returned on board, i found the other two missionaries there, several the natives, who had accompanied the captain. they spent the night with us, the next morning, showed us where to obtain a quantity the mountain tarrow. it is large, very much resembles the west india yam. for a vessel long at sea, requiring vegetables, there is none more valuable. the englishman who came on board to act as our pilot, was residing at the island, in charge a party which had been left there the english consul at the sandwich islands, to collect beach la mer, a valuable article commerce, at canton. the collecting sandal-wood, was also to be an object their attention; but they told us, that both were scarce, difficult to obtain--a statement, we considered, doubtful veracity. at 2, p.m., on the 27th june, we got underway, made sail for valparaiso, which is distant from oparro, about three thousand five hundred miles. this island, which is called the discoverer, oparro, is called the natives, lapa. it is situated in latitude 27 degrees 34 minutes south, west longitude 144 degrees. at 5, p.m., we saw the islands, called quiros, los corones, hauled up, until eight, to clear them. for the first three days after we sailed, it blew a severe gale from the westward, after which, it became more moderate, but nearly all our passage to valparaiso, was wet boisterous. it was less disagreeable, however, than we anticipated, as the wind was almost constantly fair. we had the more reason to apprehend a severe trial our fortitude, as it was in the dead winter that we were advancing into a high latitude, after having been a long time within the tropics, besides that, our sails rigging were very much worn, some our articles provisions were quite exhausted, others, the first necessity, reduced to a small quantity. if, therefore, we had encountered tedious gales ahead, we must have suffered greatly in our shattered ill-fitted condition. at 4, p.m., on the 19th july, we made the island mas a fuera, on the coast chili, seventy miles from us, at midnight, passed close to it. at day-light, juan fernandes, was in sight, fifty miles off. we passed it a little after meridian. it is very mountainous, but well covered with trees. the interesting fable robinson crusoe's adventures, has given it a lasting fame, rendered it an object curiosity to all who visit this part the pacific ocean. it is very fertile, has been tolerably well cultivated. the spanish captain-general chili, formerly made it a place banishment, after the revolution took place in that country, it was appropriated to the same purpose, the patriots royalists, as they alternately came into power. a considerable town was built the exiles, who were sent there at different times, the finest fruits chili are produced in great abundance. the cattle that have been left upon the island, are running wild in large herds, several persons have found it profitable to send parties there to kill them for their hides. the island produces some sandal-wood, but it is small, has never been collected in large quantities. fish, that very much resemble our codfish, a variety other kinds are taken in the greatest abundance around juan fernandez mas a fuera. it is believed that if a fishery were established there some our enterprising countrymen, it would be found a source great emolument. the privileges that might be considered necessary for the prosperity a company formed with this object, could easily be obtained from the government chili, there is no apparent cause the most successful results should not be realized. it seems only necessary to call the attention our capitalists to this subject, to have all its advantages secured to our country. it has a fine harbour for the prevailing winds summer, but in the winter season, when the winds set in from the northward, it is exposed. it lies a little more than three hundred miles from the coast chili, in the summer months i have known open boats to pass between it valparaiso. on the 23d july, we anchored in the harbour valparaiso, a little before day-light, to the gratification our friends, who were becoming very much alarmed for our safety, no information us having been received during the whole period our absence. thus, in a vessel 180 tons burthen, poorly fitted, having on board only about four months' provisions, when we sailed from the coast peru, we performed a cruise upwards eleven months in an unfrequented ocean, rendering to our countrymen, many the people whom we visited, important benefits, besides realizing the most successful results in the primary object our cruise. its beneficial effects will long be felt our countrymen, who are engaged in the whale-fishery; and, although we suffered many hardships, privations, dangers, we were happy in being the instruments, in the hands providence our government, proving that crime cannot go unpunished in the remotest part the earth, that no situation is so perilous as to justify despair.
