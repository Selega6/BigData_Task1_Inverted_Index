It is believed, that, in habits,\nopinions, and modes of living, the people of the Mulgrave Islands,\napproach more nearly to a state of nature than those of any other\nknown region.  The object of the CRUISE, of which a concise account\nis now offered to the Public, necessarily led to a more full\nexamination of these Islands than has yet been made, or than it will\never probably be thought worth while to make again, except for a\nsimilar purpose.\n\n\nThe delay in publishing this little work originated partly in the\nhesitation of the author in offering, and partly in that of the\nbooksellers, in accepting it; and the public must decide whether they\nwere not both right in the first instance.  It only remains for him\nto state, that all he aimed at or desired, was to give a plain,\nunpretending narrative, of what he saw, which, without presuming to\nmerit applause, might at least escape censure.\n\n_New-York, May_, 1831.\n\n\n\n\nJOURNAL\n\nOF A\n\nCRUISE OF THE U. S. SCHOONER DOLPHIN.\n\n----------\n\nIn the year 1824, the crew of a whale ship, called the Globe,\nbelonging to the island of Nantucket, mutinied while in the Pacific\nOcean, murdered the officers in latitude about eight degrees south,\nlongitude one hundred and sixty degrees west, and carried the ship to\nthe Mulgrave Islands, where it was proposed by the chief mutineers to\nburn her, and form a settlement.  Here they landed a great part of\nthe stores, sails, rigging, &c.; but some of the crew, who had no\npart in the mutiny, taking advantage of the others' being on shore,\ncut the cables, just at the dusk of evening, and, making sail, stood\nout to sea with a fine breeze.\n\nThe mutineers pursued the ship, as soon as they discovered she was\nunderway, but, finding that she outsailed them, they soon gave up the\nchase, and returned to the shore.  The nautical instruments of every\ndescription had been taken on shore by order of the mutineers, so\nthat the people on board of the Globe were left to traverse a vast\nocean, studded with islands, and rocks, and reefs, where currents are\nfrequent, strong, and variable, without any other guide by which to\ndirect their course than the stars and prevailing winds.  The\nMulgrave Islands are situated in north latitude six degrees, east\nlongitude one hundred and seventy.  three degrees; and although the\npassage of the Globe was very long, she arrived safely at Valparaiso,\nwhere the crew informed the American Consul of the events that had\ntranspired.  It was unfortunately at a period when our commerce, on\nthe coast of the Pacific, required for its protection all the naval\nforce we had at the time on that station, and no measures were taken\nto bring the offenders to answer for their crimes, until some months\nafter the Globe had returned to the United States.  Information of\nthe occurrence having been communicated to the secretary of the navy,\nhe, in 1825, directed Commodore Hull, then commanding our squadron in\nthe Pacific Ocean, to despatch the United States schooner Dolphin, in\nsearch of such of the mutineers as had been left at the Mulgraves.\nBesides the importance of bringing the guilty to punishment, for the\nsake of example,--humanity for the suffering condition of the\ninnocent, that had been left by those who escaped, dictated that\nsomething should be done for their relief.  Accordingly on the 18th\nof August, 1825, the Dolphin sailed from Chorillos, on the coast of\nPeru, under the command of Lieutenant Percival, who was directed,\npreparatory to his departure from the coast, to stop at some\nconvenient place for such refreshments as might be necessary for the\ncruise.  On the day following, we stood into the harbour of Casma,\nand anchored, when we fired several guns, as signals, to acquaint the\npeople in the interior of the arrival of a stranger that wanted their\naid.  It was not long before we had the satisfaction of seeing a\nnumber of people, who had made their appearance in obedience to the\nsignal.  A few moments' conversation with them, satisfied us that our\nwants could not be supplied here.  Wood might have been obtained, but\nthe water was neither good, nor convenient to be got at, and all\nother things that we were in want of, could only be procured at the\nmost extravagant prices.\n\nAfter laying at anchor a few hours, we got underway, and stood along\nthe coast for a small place called Santa, which was situated a few\nleagues to the north of us, Casma is but a poor harbour, as it lies\nso much exposed to the prevailing southerly winds, that frequently a\nhigh and dangerous surf breaks upon that part of the shore where\nalone (at any time) it is practicable to land.  A valley, covered\nwith thickets of reeds and bushes, extends back from the sea for\nseveral miles.  In it there is neither habitations nor inhabitants,\nand a sandy waste of hill and dale separates it from the little\nIndian village of Casma, which is several miles in the interior.  It\nis situated in a valley, about a league in circumference, which is\nwatered by a small stream.  The soil is rich, but poorly cultivated.\nThe inhabitants (of whom there is about a thousand) are all Indians.\nThey live in wretched habitations, and their intercourse with the\nSpaniards for centuries, it seems, has not much improved their\ncondition in any respect.  Their principal dependance is upon the\nsale of their poultry to such ships as visit their harbour for the\ntrade of the interior country, and to people thus engaged, their\nproximity may sometimes be a very great convenience.\n\nThe harbour of Santa is formed by several small islands, lying a\nlittle to the south of it, and about a mile from the main.  We passed\nbetween the islands and the main, although it was night, and very\ndark.  On the following morning, we made the customary signal, by\nfiring a gun, which, in a very short time, brought the captain of the\nport down to the beach.  He had not much the appearance of official\ndignity, having a long black beard, and was in no respect\nprepossessing.  Rude, however, as was his exterior, he was profuse in\noffers of hospitality.  He assured us that we should be abundantly\nsupplied with every thing we wanted, and requested that an officer\nmight be sent with him to Santa, to negociate for our supplies.  The\npurser and myself were ordered upon this service, and not having time\nto send to Santa for horses, it being six miles from our anchorage,\nwe were reduced to the necessity of a most painful ride, behind the\ncaptain of the port and a companion whom he had brought with him.\nThe road was over an uninterrupted plain, which was almost everywhere\ncovered with impenetrable thickets of reeds, and the Algaroba[1], and\nin some places a foot or two deep with water that had escaped from\nthe streams of the cultivated valley.  When we arrived at the door of\nthe commandant's house, he shewed us in with an air of some\nformality, and welcomed us with every Spanish expression of\nhospitality.  The appearance of the house corresponded well with that\nof its occupant.  It was disgusting in the extreme.  There were but\ntwo rooms in it, one of which was occupied as a granary and bed-room,\nand the other as a pulparia,[2] and the ordinary conveniences of the\nfamily.  In the middle of the latter, hung a hog, weighing three or\nfour hundred pounds, which had been butchered that morning.  The\ncaptain pretended he could himself supply whatever we asked for,\nassuring us that he would sell more cheaply than any one else, and\nevinced an extreme jealousy at our conversing with any other than\nhimself upon the subject of our visit to Santa.  As a matter of\ncourtesy, we soon made our way to the house of the governor, and paid\nour respects to him.  He seemed to feel highly complimented with our\nattention, and, like the captain of the port, proffered his\nassistance to obtain for us whatever we stood in need of.  He bore\nthe name of the cruel conqueror of Peru, it being nothing less than\nthe great Pizarro; but it was evident, from his complexion and\ncurling locks, that his ancestors came from Africa.  Notwithstanding\nthis disadvantage, however, he could not be compared to the captain\nof the port without disparagement, and, considering the wretched\nsociety in which he lived, I thought he discharged his official\nduties rather creditably.  Both the governor and captain of the port\ninvited us to dine with them; and each, fearing we would make our\npurchase of the other, solicited our company very earnestly.  We\nfinally accepted the invitation of the latter, and he escorted us\nback to his house, where the table was already smoking with savoury\ndishes, served up in a variety of ways from the huge animal we had\nseen there in the morning, under circumstances by no means calculated\nto improve our appetites.  A rabble, formed of half naked Indians,\nand long bearded white men, assembled in the room, while we were at\ndinner, some of whom sat down at table unceremoniously, and partook\nwith us.  Our host indulged himself freely with the use of\naquadiente,[3] and, ere we finished our repast, his house exhibited a\nconstant scene of riot, from which we were exceedingly glad to\nescape.  After making a few purchases we returned on board.  The next\nday, a party, consisting of about thirty or forty, came down to make\nus a visit.  All degrees of the society of Santa, without any\ndistinction,--whites, mulattoes, and Indians, having, it would seem,\nmingled together for the occasion.  They remained with us all day,\neating and drinking, and appeared to be very happy; but begged for\nevery thing that came in their way.  At sunset, to our great\nsatisfaction, they left us, and on the following morning, we got\nunderway, and continued along the coast to the north.\n\nThe small town of Santa contains about two thousand inhabitants,\nnearly all of whom are Indians.  It is situated in latitude nine\ndegrees south, in the valley of Santa, which is twenty or thirty\nmiles in circumference, beautiful and rich in soil, and watered by a\ndeep and rapid stream, which takes its rise in the Andes, at the\ndistance of a hundred miles from the sea coast.  Previous to the\nrevolution, it was a flourishing valley, with a numerous population,\nproducing rice, wheat, and other grain, in considerable quantities,\nfor exportation; and frequently large herds of cattle were driven\nfrom it to Lima.  It abounds also in fruits, such as oranges, lemons,\ngrapes, and a variety of other delicious kinds.  Large farming\nestablishments are every where to be seen, each comprehending\nthousands of acres, and previous to the revolution possessed by\ngentlemen of ample fortune.  All of these are, now in ruins, and most\nof them unoccupied.  The climate of Santa is mild, and almost\nunvarying.  Here, as in nearly all the rest of Peru, bordering on the\nPacific Ocean, it never rains, and wherever the land is cultivated it\nis watered from the rivers.\n\nAround the cultivated valley of Santa, are spread extensive plains of\nbarren sand; and at a short distance back from the sea rises the\nfirst range of gloomy and sterile mountains which, increasing in\naltitude as you advance into the interior, terminates in the eternal\nsnow-covered Andes, at the distance of from fifty to a hundred miles.\nAt Santa we obtained wood with ease, and from two or three old wells,\nnear the shore, filled our casks with brackish water.  Where the\nriver empties into the harbour it is so much exposed to the sea as to\nrender watering difficult, and almost always dangerous.  Santa was a\nplace of some trade before the revolution, it being connected by\ndirect communication with some mines of the precious metals in the\ninterior.\n\nOn the 24th of August, we anchored in the roads of Huanchaco, and\ncommunicated with several vessels that were lying there.  Huanchaco\nis an Indian village, and the seaport of the city of Bolivia, the\nancient name of which was Truxillo.  It is exposed to the sea, and at\ntimes the surf breaks so violently on the shore, as to prevent all\nintercourse with the vessels at anchor.  The Indians are provided\nwith a float they call Balsa, and on which they pass through this\nsurf, in cases of great emergency, when no boat could live in it.  It\nis composed merely of two bundles of long reeds, bound compactly\ntogether, tapering a little at one end, and the two bundles secured\nto each other, the small ends coming to a point, somewhat resembling\nin appearance the bow of a boat.  In the middle it is hollowed\nsufficiently for a man to seat himself securely.  It is usually about\nfifteen feet long, and from two to three feet wide.  It is calculated\nfor one man only, who directs it with his paddle.  I one day\nwitnessed their wonderful skill in the management of the balsa.  The\nsurf was breaking so furiously, that the men, accustomed to work in\nit, advised me not to go on board of my ship.  Whilst I was standing\non the shore, with several of them around me, a boat appeared just\nwithout the heavy rollers that were setting in, filled with people,\nwho it was evident were strangers to the danger they were about to\nencounter, as they were dashing on fearlessly into the surf.  The\nIndians near me made motions, and called to them not to advance\nfurther, but they neither saw nor heard the warning.  Observing this,\nsix or eight of them launched their balsas, and in a few minutes were\nin the midst of the breakers.  They were just in time, for the boat\nin a moment afterwards darted forward with great velocity, and\nsuddenly disappeared.  The wave had broken, and was foaming over her,\nand another must have terminated the existence of every person on\nboard; but, before the next swell, that came rolling on in quick\nsuccession had reached them, each man was upon a balsa, and the\nskilful and intrepid Indians bore them safely to the shore.  We\nremained but a few hours at Huanchaco, when we continued on to the\nnorth, and on the 25th of August, came up with the Lobos Islands, in\nlatitude six degrees south, and distant about a hundred miles from\nthe coast.  They are barren rocks, rising in some places several\nhundred feet, and no where have any appearance of vegetation.  With\nthe aid of our glasses, we saw at a distance a number of people upon\nthese inhospitable rocks, and supposing they might be some\nunfortunate seamen, whose vessel had been cast away, we hove to, with\na view of affording them relief.  Upon examination, however, they\nproved to be Indians from the coast, who had come here on a\ncatamaran, upon a fishing enterprise, it being the season when great\nquantities of fish, resembling mackerel, are taken on the shores of\nthese Islands.\n\nPrevious to ascertaining who these fishermen were, we landed on a\nsmall island nearer to us, where, on the side of a hill, forty or\nfifty yards distant, we saw several hundreds of seals basking in the\nsun.  The rock rose perhaps a hundred feet, and many of the seals\nwere near the top of it.  The noise of our landing gave them the\nalarm, and, as we had cut them off from the water, they made the best\nof their way for the other side of the hill, joining in a terrific\ngrowl like so many furious mastiffs.  They had reached the top of the\nhill, and were descending on the opposite side, when we overtook\nthem, and very wantonly killed several.  They were so large that many\nof them would have weighed at least five or six hundred pounds, but\ntheir motions were extremely clumsy.  Whenever we came near them they\nwould growl, and snapped at us like a ferocious dog, and their long\nteeth warned us not to approach them within striking distance.\nConsidering their immense size, it is astonishing bow slight a blow\nwill kill them when given on the nose.  If, however, this fatal part\nis missed, and they receive a severe blow upon any other part of the\nhead, they suffer but little injury, and become extremely tenacious\nof life, particularly if it has time to swell.  The nose is then no\nlonger a mortal part, and it is almost impossible to subdue them.  We\nwitnessed several instances of this kind, being but poorly provided\nwith weapons proper for the purpose, and withal unskilled in the use\nof them.  In descending from the top of the hill, there was but one\nnarrow defile by which they could escape, and there they floundered\nfor nearly half an hour, tumbling over each other three or four deep,\nuntil at last they got into their native element.\n\nThe north side of the Lobos Islands affords a fine harbour, where we\nsaw a small vessel at anchor waiting for the proceeds of her cargo,\nwhich had been landed on the coast at a place called Lambayaca.\n\nOn the 26th of August, we anchored at Peyta, in latitude five degrees\nsouth.  This was the last place at which it would be convenient for\nus to stop, and here, to our gratification, we were enabled to obtain\nthe necessary refreshments for our cruise.  We filled the deck with\npigs, poultry, and vegetables, and at considerable expense succeeded,\nafter much trouble, in obtaining a supply of good water.  Peyta is\nsituated in a deep bay, and is a good harbour, formed by two\nprojecting points of land, and is for many leagues surrounded by\nbarren sand.  It is the seaport of an interior city, called Pieura,\nand receives from distant valleys all that is necessary for the\nconsumption of the inhabitants or strangers, who visit it for the\npurposes of trade.  It is supplied with water from a river that\nempties itself into the sea, near a small Indian town called Golan,\nwhence we found it necessary to resort for a supply.  When we had\nproceeded there, and anchored our vessel within a mile or two of the\ntown, the only method by which we could obtain water, was to have it\nbrought in calabashes on mules.  It was their saint's day, and in the\nvillage all was frolic and mirth.  Groups of men and women were\neverywhere seen, dressed fantastically, singing and dancing along the\nstreets.  I called upon the governor, who was a white man, very early\nin the morning, to report the arrival of our vessel, and the object\nof our visit.  He had just risen from his hammock, and received me\nwith many expressions of civility, and proffers of assistance.  His\nhouse was but little better than that of the captain of the port of\nSanta, and his appearance not more prepossessing.  The room into\nwhich I was ushered had no other floor than the ground beaten hard,\non which were several large piles of pumpkins, bags of beans, and\nIndian corn, which he proposed to sell me before our official\ninterview had ended.  Immediately after breakfast he came on board to\nvisit the captain, bringing with him several emales.  They remained\non board nearly all day, to the annoyance of every body, and in the\nevening were removed to the shore with great difficulty, so freely\nhad they partaken of our hospitality.  Soon after our arrival at\nPeyta, we were invited to dine with the governor, who treated us with\ngreat kindness and hospitality.  Some months previous to our arrival,\nhis son had shipped himself at Talcahuana, on board of the Dolphin,\nas a common sailor, and was discharged on our arrival here, and\npermitted to remain with his friends.  He was spoken of amongst us as\na person who had been compelled to fly from his home for improper\nconduct of some kind, and now the whole mystery was explained.  His\nfather was one of the most respectable and patriotic men in the place\nwhere he resided; but this son was a youth of a bad disposition, and\nhad given him a great deal of trouble.  When the revolution first\ncommenced in that section of the country, he provided himself with\nthe uniform of a patriot officer, and went about the country, where\nhe was a stranger, or but slightly known, and under the authority of\nhis pretended commission, took, by violence, the cattle and horses of\nthe farmers, or whatever else he could possess himself of, which he\nconverted into money for his own purposes.  Sometimes he even pressed\nthe Indians as soldiers, and compelled them to assist him in carrying\noff his plunder.\n\nAt length, his exactions became so heavy, and were levied so\ntyrannically, that a gentleman resisted him, and questioned the\nlegality of his authority.  Numbers were fired with indignation\nagainst him, and the propriety of his conduct was no sooner\nquestioned, than the investigation was followed up with such\nactivity, that, finding there was no safety but in flight, he\npreferred a voluntary exile to meeting the just resentment of the\npeople he had injured.  He had suffered many hardships during his\nabsence, and appeared on his return to be truly penitent.  I was at\nhis father's house when he entered.  His mother and sisters were\ndeeply affected, and received him with all the tenderness of female\nsympathy, their eyes overflowing with tears.  They each embraced him,\nas one most dear to them; but when he approached his father (a man\nabout sixty) who was standing on the opposite side of the room, he\ncaught the old man's eye bent indignantly upon him, and turned away\nwith a look humbled to the dust.\n\nWhilst lying here we had an opportunity of witnessing a solitary\ninstance of an enterprising disposition in a Peruvian Indian,--a\ncharacteristic, it is believed, they but rarely possess, or, at most,\nbut in a slight degree.  We had on board an Indian youth, who\nbelonged to this part of Peru, and for several days had held frequent\nconversations with his countrymen, who were attracted on board by\ncuriosity.  One of these people had concerted with the youth a plan\nfor his deserting.  In compliance with this arrangement, he put off,\nduring the mid-watch, with his canoe, and taking his station just\nahead of the Dolphin, gave a shrill whistle as the signal of his\napproach.  The lad, fearing that he might be detected, did not\nventure to answer the signal, which was repeated several times, when\nthe officer of the watch suspecting the object, gave the long\nexpected response, and the credulous Indian came cautiously paddling\nclose under the bow of the vessel, where, to his amazement, he was\nmade prisoner, and compelled to go on board.  When the captain came\non deck the next morning, he punished the poor Indian, by impressing\nupon him the belief that he intended to detain, and make a soldier of\nhim.  Not having sagacity enough to know the difference between our\nvessel and a patriot man-of-war, and conceiving that there was no\nchance for his escape, he made the most pathetic appeals to the\ncaptain's humanity, and appeared to suffer all the agony of despair.\nThe captain ordered a cartridge-box to be put over his shoulders, and\na musket placed in his hands.\n\nHe seemed frantic with the reality of his servitude, using his utmost\nviolence to disengage himself from the cartridge-box and musket,\ndeclaring again and again that he was no soldier, and in the most\naffecting manner begging the captain for God's sake to permit him to\ngo on shore.  When his tormentors discontinued their persecutions, he\njumped over the stern into his canoe, with great activity, and soon\njoined his anxious friends on the beach, who had assembled there,\napprehensive of his captivity, and awaiting the result.\n\nOn the 2d of September, we sailed from Peyta, and shaped our course\nfor the Gallapagos Islands.  The trade wind was moderate, accompanied\nwith fine weather.  On the morning of the 6th, we made Hood's Island,\nand in a few hours afterwards, anchored on the west side, in a small\nharbour, called Gardner's Bay, the only one it affords.  After\ndinner, the captain took with him twenty or thirty of the crew, and\nwent in pursuit of turtle.  The island is high and mountainous,\ncovered everywhere with volcanic cinders, many of which are in huge\nmasses.  The men were at first very eager in their search for turtle,\nand the whole crew, if they had been permitted, would gladly have\nengaged in it.\n\nThey expected to have found the turtle near the shore; instead of\nwhich they had to scramble over rocks and climb mountains, half the\ntime making their way through brambles, at the expense of scratches\nand torn clothes.  Men were never more disappointed than our crew in\nthe amusement of catching turtle.  Sometimes they would wander about\nfor hours before they found one, and then it would probably be a mile\nor two from the beach, and as much as a man could well lift.  By\nsundown we had collected about thirty, of large size.  Black grouper\nwere very abundant close to our anchorage, but the sharks were so\nnumerous that for every fish taken we lost one or two hooks.  We got\na plentiful supply for the crew, however, in the course of an hour.\nOn the following morning, we joined Captain Meek, of the brig\nTamahamah, which vessel had accompanied us hither, and making a large\nparty--went round the island about ten or twelve miles from our\nanchorage, where we expected to find turtle more abundant.  The\ncaptain was an old cruiser here, and well calculated to make one of\nan agreeable party.  He stood cook for us, and as the day was very\nwarm, our first essay on landing, was to make a large bower, under\nwhich to prepare our dinner.  The people then dispersed, to look for\nturtle, the first of which were served up for our dinner, in a style\nthat might have been relished by less keen appetites than ours, which\nwere sharpened by laborious exercise.  At night, we had collected\nupwards of a hundred, besides ten large green turtle, we were so\nfortunate as to find on the beach near the place of our landing.\nWhen we came to assemble our men to return on board, two of them were\nmissing, and upon inquiry were ascertained to have been absent nearly\nall day.  We dispersed and looked for them in every direction until\ndark, when every body being much fatigued, a party was left to search\nfor them again in the morning, and the rest repaired on board.  In\nthe morning, we renewed our labours without success, and with great\nreason began to feel seriously alarmed for the safety of our\nshipmates.  There was no water on the island, and the preceding day\nhad been so extremely warm, that we feared the poor fellows would\nsoon perish, if they had not already.  Our search, too, was attended\nwith considerable danger.  Wandering about in distant parts of the\nisland, we sometimes, in clambering over rocks and mountains, changed\nour course without being sensible of it, and would find ourselves\npursuing our way in a different direction from what we supposed.  In\nthe afternoon, when our strength and patience were quite exhausted,\nand our parties returning for the night, the lost men suddenly\nappeared on the beach, close to the vessel.  They were pale and\nemaciated, with scarcely strength to move one foot before the other.\nTheir clothes were in tatters, and their shoes worn off their feet,\nwhich were very much crippled with their long journey over the sharp\ncinders.  It appeared from the story of these men, that they had\nseveral times been on the side of the island where we were anchored,\nbut upon an eminence that overlooked the vessel, and thinking\nthemselves on the other side, recrossed; when, to their astonishment,\nseeing nothing of her, they would retrace their steps; and in this\nmanner, were wandering about for many hours, almost despairing at\nlast of finding relief.  While they were in this wretched situation,\nthey several times quenched their thirst by killing turtle that came\nin their way, and drinking from the reservoir with which nature has\nsupplied this singular animal.  I have since been told by a seaman,\nthat he deserted from a whale ship at these islands, accompanied by a\nnumber of others, and that for weeks, they had no other water than\nwhat they obtained by breaking open the turtles and drinking of the\nwater they found in them.  It is contained in a pouch that resembles\na bladder, and is immediately connected with the stomach.  It is\nlarge in proportion to the size of the animal, and some of them will\nhold two or three gallons.  It surprised us to see the tameness of\nthe birds.  They would scarcely fly from us when we approached them\nwithin a few feet, and in many instances we could pick them up with\nour hands.  The gannet, generally of a clear white, and as large as a\ngoose, we could catch with great ease; and the albatrosses, some grey\nand some yellow, which were much larger than any bird we have in the\nUnited States, would but rarely rise upon the wing to escape us.\nThey ran very fast, and would sometimes give us a chase of one or two\nhundred yards.  A bird, the plumage and form of which differed in no\nrespect from our mocking-bird, would feed within a few feet of us,\nand the turtle-doves were killed in great numbers by our people, with\nshort poles.  Hood's Island is evidently of volcanic origin.  It is,\nindeed, nothing but a mass of cinders.  It is covered with a slight\ngrowth of scrubby bushes of various kinds, and occasionally a tree of\nfour or five inches in diameter, is met with.  Of all its vegetation,\nthe cactus seems best adapted to it.  There is a variety of the\nspecies; one of which attains to a larger size than any other\nproduction of the island, and spreads out into a tree of considerable\nheight.  This kind of the cactus is chosen by the turtle for food.\nWhen the whalers, or other visiters, go to the Gallapagos Islands for\nthese animals, they cut down a number of the trees in the evening,\nand on the following morning they are sure to find turtle feeding\nthere, although none could be seen in its vicinity on the preceding\nday.  The guanas are not the least remarkable of the inhabitants of\nthe Gallapagos.  They are from two to three feet long and shaped like\na lizard.  Their colour varies from grey to jet black.  They are\neasily caught and quite harmless; are often eaten and said to be\nexcellent.  On the top of the head they have a beautiful shining\ncrest of black and yellow, which, in the sun, has a most brilliant\nappearance.\n\nExcept where we anchored, a heavy surf breaks all round Hood's\nIsland.  In a high and central part of it, is a place which resembles\nthe dry bed of a small lake.  It is surrounded by ridges and peaks of\ncinders rising in some places from one to three hundred feet, and in\nall probability has been the crater of a volcano.  In places\ndifficult of access we saw a few seals, but so shy that with the\nexception of one or two instances, we could not approach them.  The\nfew that we killed were hair seal, and consequently of but little\nvalue.  Between Hood's Island and the small one that forms the\nharbour, there is a passage for ships, but it is very narrow, and\nwith a strong current that runs through it, which would always render\nit dangerous for a ship to attempt to pass, particularly so if the\nwind were not perfectly fair.\n\nAt one, P.M., on the 10th of September, we got underway, and stood\nover for Charles Island, where we anchored at six, in Essex Bay.\nRock Dismal, so called by Commodore Porter, is an excellent land\nmark, and seems to have been appropriately named.  It rises to the\neastward of Essex Bay, in sharp crags of fifty to a hundred feet\nhigh.  A few solitary bushes constitute all its vegetation.  In\napproaching Essex Bay, and at its entrance, we were alarmed several\ntimes by a strong ripple, but in casting the lead found no bottom\nwith ten fathoms of line.  At Essex Bay, is the celebrated\npost-office of the whalers, to which Commodore Porter resorted\nseveral times during his cruise for information.  We found a letter\nthere left by a whaler who had visited Charles Island for a supply of\nturtle.  He was last from the river Tumbez, where one of his crew had\ncaught a fever, of which he died.  Two others lost their way in the\nmountains of Charles Island, where, after wandering about for a\nconsiderable time, one of them complained to his companion of a\nhead-ache, and soon after sat down and died.  The other found his way\nto the ship after a great deal of suffering.\n\nCharles Island is high and mountainous, and like Hood's, is covered\nwith a thin growth of bushes.  At the distance of a mile from the\nbeach there is a small spring of water, to which there is a footpath\nover the crags and hills, worn by visiters in search of turtle, a\nscanty supply of which can only be obtained with great labour.  The\nresidence of Pat, the Irishman, in this lone and dreary place, for a\nnumber of years, has made it an object of curiosity to all who visit\nthe island.  Here he planted his potatoes and pumpkins, and raised\nhis chickens; administering the government of his island with\ndespotic sway, for Pat was a monarch although he pillowed his head\nupon a rock, and reposed his rude limbs on a bed made of bushes.  The\nstory is known to all who have read Commodore Porter's journal, in\nwhich he gives an account of Pat's residence on this island, and of\nhis possessing himself of the person and services of a black man\nbelonging to a whale ship, who had strayed too far from his\ncompanions, and whom Pat held in durance for a long time.\n\nAt ten, A.M., we parted company with the Tamahamah, and sailed for\nthe Marqueses Islands.  The turtle with which our deck was covered,\nwere very troublesome and offensive for about a week, when they\nbecame quite domesticated and gave us not the slightest\ninconvenience.  For two or three weeks we served them to the crew\nconstantly, in lieu of the usual allowance of salt provisions.  It\nwas a most valuable substitute, and important to us, as we were bound\nupon a long cruise, as well for the health of the crew as for the\npreservation of our sea stock.  When the number became comparatively\nsmall, we discontinued the general use of them, and served them only\nonce or twice a week.  We never fed them, and for aught I could see,\nthey were equally as fat and healthy a month after they were taken on\nboard, as on the first day.  As a sea stock nothing can be more\nconvenient or better calculated for a long cruise.  They may be put\nany where and kept in almost any way, and if it should be thought\nadvisable to feed them, there is scarcely any vegetable substance\nthat they will not eat after they are a little domesticated.  The\nliver of this turtle is particularly delicious.  When fried, it is\nnot unlike a fine oyster, and although partaken very freely of, no\nill effect is ever experienced from it.  Sixteen days after leaving\nCharles Island, we made the island Rooahooga, one of the southernmost\nof the Marqueses group.  The wind was fresh and blew steadily from\nthe southward and eastward, accompanied by a heavy swell.  As we\napproached the islands, we had some rainy and cloudy weather, but\nwith this exception, our whole passage was attended with clear days\nand fine moonlight nights.  In latitude three degrees south, and\nlongitude ninety-five degrees west, we observed a remarkable\nappearance in the water, which, had we been navigating an\nunfrequented ocean, would have very much alarmed us.  At several\ndifferent times during the day, on September 12th, we passed through\nviolent rips, and at times nearly the whole ocean assumed the\nappearance and agitation of boiling water.\n\nThroughout our passage, we remarked, that whenever the wind hauled to\nthe southward of southeast, it increased in force.  It occurred so\nfrequently as to be a subject of general remark.\n\nOn the 20th of September, in latitude seven degrees fifty minutes\nsouth, and longitude one hundred and twenty degrees thirty minutes\nwest, we saw a comet for the first time, thirty or forty degrees\nabove the horizon, and bearing from us east by north.  At day-light,\non the morning of September 26th, several of the southernmost of the\nMarqueses were in sight.  They were all mountainous, but covered with\nvegetation, and as we drew near presented a pleasing contrast to the\nsterile and gloomy Gallapagos.  We stood along the shore of La\nDominica, admiring the beautiful little valleys that were presented\nto our view in quick succession, where villages of palm-thatched\nhuts, surrounded by clumps of tall cocoa-nut and wide-spreading bread\nfruit trees, formed scenes of rural quiet calculated to fill the\nimagination with the most agreeable conceptions of the happy\ncondition of their inhabitants.  At length we came to a small bay\nwhere the valley was more populous than any we had seen before, and\nthe captain, to our great satisfaction, hauled up for it and stood\nclose in towards the island.  We lowered a boat, and providing\nourselves with a few trifles for presents, pulled into the bay within\na few yards of the shore.  The beach was already thronged with people\nof all ages, male and female, who invited us to land by the most\nsignificant gestures, whilst many of them were singing and dancing to\nexpress their joy.  The surrounding rocks and hills were covered with\ngroups of females, gaily decked off with their neat head-dresses of\nthe white Tapa cloth and many-coloured robes, which were floating in\nthe wind, half concealing and half exposing their fantastically\npainted limbs.  When they saw that we would not land, the men and\nboys dashed into the water with whatever they had to offer us, and\nswam off to the boat.  A chief, who had a dry wreath of cocoa-nut\naround his brows, came off with them; and, upon being invited, got\ninto the boat, where he remained until our departure, apparently\ngiving orders from time to time to those who were passing and\nrepassing from the shore to the boat.  In a few minutes, they had\npresented us with a considerable quantity of cocoa-nuts, bananas, and\npapayas, for which we gave them in return a few trifling articles,\nthe most valuable of which were glass beads.  The chief had his eyes\nconstantly fixed upon our fire-arms, and finally gave us to\nunderstand, by motions, that a pistol would be acceptable to him.\nWith this intimation we could not comply; but he bore the refusal\nwith great good nature, and for some time after our store of little\npresents was exhausted, his people continued to bring us off fruit\nwithout the expectation of any return.  When they found that we were\nserious in our refusal to land, the women came from the hills and\nassembled on the rocks close to us, where, in a nearer view, they\ncould display their persons to more advantage, and charm us with the\nmelody of their voices.  There they all joined in songs, keeping time\nby clapping their hands, stopping occasionally to receive the\napplause of the men and to invite us on shore.  Several of them, male\nand female, swam off to the boat; and when we were about to depart,\ninsisted so strongly upon going on board with us that we had to use\nsome violence to get clear of them.\n\nWe continued on in the afternoon, soon passing La Dominica, and at\nsundown made Rooahooga ahead.  The weather being squally and the\nisland only fifteen miles from us, we lay by for the night.  At\ndaylight, we found ourselves a few miles distant from the middle of\nthe south side of the island, where a bay presented itself, which, at\na distance, promised to afford anchorage.  On a nearer approach,\nhowever, its appearance changed, and as there were but few signs of\ninhabitants, we ran along toward the west end of the island.  This\npart of it had not much appearance of fertility, although we saw a\nfew large trees.  It is high, broken, and indented with a number of\nsmall bays, none of which are large enough to form a harbour.  In\nrounding the southwest point of the island we had sudden and violent\ngusts of wind.  Invisible Bay is situated a little to the westward of\nthis point, and although it has somewhat the appearance of a harbour,\nand presents to view a beautiful sand beach, we saw no indications of\ninhabitants.  About ten miles to the north, we anchored in twenty\nfathoms water, having rocky bottom, and an inaccessible rocky shore\nwhere the surf breaks violently.  The captain and several officers\nwent back to Invisible Bay in one of the boats, and in a cave close\nto the shore they found five or six natives, who at their approach,\nfled to the hills, making signs for our people to depart.  In the\ncave, they found a few fishing-nets.  They tried to prevail upon the\nnatives to come near, but their demonstrations of friendship were\nanswered only by motions expressive of hostility.  The landing was\ndifficult, as the shore was rocky, and a considerable surf broke upon\nit, although the bay was tolerably protected by a projecting point.\nSoon after meridian, we got under way and shaped our course for\nNooaheeva, which was plainly in sight from Rooahooga.  We stood\nalong, with a fine breeze and clear weather, and at three, P.M.,\nrounded the north-eastern extremity of Nooaheeva, when a spacious\nharbour, called Comptroller's Bay, opened to our view.  It is about\nthree miles deep, and at its inner extremity are two projecting\npoints that extend out for more than a mile, and form three small\nharbours.  We were no sooner observed by the natives on shore, than\nthey put off in a number of large canoes and pulled with great\nrapidity towards us.  The wind was light and baffling, and we\nadvanced slowly into the harbour.  In a few minutes, we were\nsurrounded by canoes, containing from six to eight men each.  They\nbelonged to different tribes, which they attempted to explain to us\nwith great earnestness of speech and gesture, but as we had no one on\nboard who knew much of the language, we were greatly at a loss to\ncomprehend their meaning.  They had not followed us long when two of\nthe canoes came along side, one on each quarter, and the men crawled\nup the side and perched themselves upon the hammocks, like so many\nmonkeys, where they called out in a loud voice, addressing themselves\nalternately to us and to the natives on the side of the vessel\nopposite to them,--one party exclaiming \"Mattee, mattee, Typee!\" and\nthe other \"Mattee, mattee,[4] Happah!\" and occasionally using angry\ngestures with the exclamation.  This was too expressive for us not to\nunderstand.  They belonged to different tribes, the Typee, and\nHappah; and were mutually trying to prejudice us against the tribe to\nwhich they did not belong, in order to induce us to anchor in their\nown bay.  Both the bays were beautiful, but as the Happahs' was the\nmost populous and nearest to us, we gave it the preference; and a\nlittle before sunset anchored in twenty fathoms water within a\ncable's length of the shore.  The Typees no sooner saw that we were\nstanding in for the Happah Bay, than they hurried into their canoe\nand paddled off for their village as fast as they could.  The Happah\nvalley was a romantic spot.  A plain, a league or two in\ncircumference, stretched back to the mountains in a semicircular\nform, presenting in front a clear white sand beach about a mile long.\nThe plain was covered with cocoa-nuts, with bread-fruit interspersed,\nand near enough to form a continued shade without presenting the\nappearance of a dense forest.  Scattered about every where through\nthese trees were the palm-thatched habitations of the natives.  In\nthe rear of the plain, the mountains rose precipitously, forming an\ninsuperable barrier against the incursions of other tribes.  The land\nrose gently to the left, but it was almost barren and added nothing\nto the beauty of the landscape.  On the extreme right, a considerable\nmountain and a point projecting far out into the bay, separated the\nHappahs from the tribes that lived beyond them in that direction.\nNothing could equal the apparent joy of the natives when they saw us\nanchored in front of their village.  The whole tribe, which probably\ndid not exceed five hundred, flocked down to the beach, expressing\ntheir satisfaction by dancing and singing.  Hundreds of them dashed\ninto the water and swam off to us, so that we had not time to furl\nsails and clear the deck before the vessel was crowded with people.\nTo show them that we had the means of making successful resistance\nagainst any hostile intention they might adopt, we paraded our\nmusketeers upon the deck and practised them, a ceremony that appeared\nto afford the natives very great amusement.  We allowed them to\nremain on board until the dusk of evening, when the number being so\ngreat as to make the vessel uncomfortable, and apprehending that in\nthe course of the night they might appropriate to themselves many\nthings that they would find about the deck, and which could not\nconveniently be spared, we sent most of them on shore.  The chiefs\nand a few others who expressed a great desire to remain, were\npermitted to pass the night with us.\n\nOn the following day, I took a few presents with me and went over to\nthe Typee valley, to visit that tribe, celebrated as the most warlike\nof Nooaheeva.  As soon as the boat was perceived, the people came\nrunning towards the beach in every direction, and before she reached\nthe shore we were surrounded by great numbers, who plunged into the\nwater and swam off to us.  As many as we could conveniently\naccommodate were permitted to get into the boat, where they treated\nme so unceremoniously that I did not think it prudent to land.\nAmongst those who paid me a visit was a chief of the tribe.  He was a\nman about thirty years of age, well-featured and of fine proportions.\nHis deportment was grave and dignified, but like the rest of our new\nacquaintances, who swam off to us, he was quite naked except a slight\ncovering about his loins.  The common people treated him with great\ndeference, and never intruded upon that part of the boat where he was\nseated.  He made us understand that he wished to obtain muskets and\npowder, for the purchase of which he had caused five or six large\nhogs to be brought down, that were tied and laying on the shore.  I\noffered him whatever else I had that I thought would induce him to\npart with them; but he obstinately refused any other consideration\nthan muskets and powder.  Large quantities of cocoa-nuts, bananas,\nand papayas were thrown into the boat by the people who were swimming\naround us, and when we had been lying there an hour, we had as many\nin the boat as we could conveniently carry.  I had a variety of\npresents, such as beads, buttons, &c., all of which the common people\nwere very anxious to obtain; but the chief would take nothing from me\nof less consequence than fire-arms or gunpowder.  I offered him\nflints and musket balls, which, although of great value amongst the\nnatives, he would not receive.  He invited me frequently, with great\nearnestness of manner, to land, until he found, by my repeated\nrefusals, that I was determined to remain in my boat.\n\nThe bay of the Typees was rather smaller than that of the Happah\ntribe.  They live principally upon the side of a mountain that rises\ngently from the shore.  The number of the tribe appeared to be about\nthe same as that of the Happahs.  Their houses are situated in\ncircular chains of villages, rising one above the other, from the\nbase to near the top of the mountain, where it terminates in rude and\nuninhabitable cliffs.  Groves and clumps of cocoa-nut, and\nbread-fruit trees are every where interspersed with the dwellings,\nand the mind of the observer being impressed with the idea of their\nusefulness to the natives, gives a double effect to the beautiful\nlandscape adorned by their waving tops and broad green leaves.  We\nhad several occasions to remark the inveterate dislike that the\nTypees and Happahs entertained towards each other.\n\nOn the morning after our arrival, the sailing-master went on shore in\nthe Happah valley to obtain an altitude of the sun by the artificial\nhorizon He was shy of the natives, as we all were at first, and\napprehending that some of them might approach him with a hostile\nintention, while his back was turned towards them, and having heard\nthat they held in great reverence a place said to be Tabooed, or\nconsecrated, he made a circle round his place observation, and told\nthe natives, who had followed him in great numbers, that the space\nwithin the circle was Tabooed.  They stared at him in silence and\nstood back from it; but by and by, when he was intently engaged in\ngetting his altitude, one of the natives, supposing that he was\nemployed in some plan (to him incomprehensible) to destroy the\nTypees, as he turned the face of his sextant in that direction,\ncrawled up gently behind the sailing-master, without being perceived\nby him, and suddenly tapping him two or three times on the shoulder,\nexclaimed with great energy, \"Mattee, mattee, Typee!\"  It may readily\nbe supposed that his imagination, which was very much excited before,\nwas not soothed by this salutation.  He turned upon the native,\nexpressing in look and manner his consternation and displeasure,\nwhich was only met by the delighted Indian with a repetition of\n\"Mattee, mattee, Typee!\"\n\nOn the morning of the 25th, I went on shore, in company with several\nof the officers, to indulge our curiosity and ramble about the\nvalley.  We were soon surrounded by a group of natives, who followed\nus wherever we went.  Our first object was to visit the chief of the\nvalley, whose residence we found at the distance of two or three\nhundred yards from the shore.  It was a plain, oblong hut, thirty by\ntwenty feet.  Its simple structure was such as is first suggested to\nthe untutored mind--a few poles laid over crotches, upon which was\nframed a triangular roof, and the whole thatched with palm or\ncocoa-nut leaves.  When we entered this regal hut we found the chief\nseated near one end of it, who barely condescended to notice us as we\napproached to make our salutations.  We were not prepared for so rude\na reception and felt somewhat mortified to find a chief of his\ndistinguished rank so totally destitute of courtesy.  We thought at\nleast that he would have risen from his sitting posture, and expected\nmore from him than our after experience taught us we had a right to\nlook for from people in a state of nature.  The only furniture in the\nhut was a few coarse mats.  At one side of it five muskets, highly\npolished, were arranged one above the other, over which hung two kegs\nof powder sewed up in canvass, and near them a few long spears and a\nwar conch, ornamented with human hair.  We made ourselves as much at\nhome as if we had received a more cordial welcome, and indulged our\ncuriosity in examining whatever we saw, when suddenly the chief rose\nand his silence and gravity were at once explained.  We had remarked\nthat he had an uncommonly large black robe thrown over him, but\nwithout the least suspicion that it covered any one else than\nhimself.  He suddenly threw it aside as we came near him and there\nstood his wife, a girl about eighteen years of age, who had just\nfinished making her toilet.  He pointed to her with a look of\nsatisfaction, and uttered \"Motake,\" a word we afterwards learned,\nsignified very good, or very well.  Although she was naturally a\npretty girl, she had made herself a hideous looking object.  She had\nsmeared her face all over with a coarse yellow paint, upon which was\ndrawn streaks of black and green, than which nothing could have\nappeared more disgusting.  She assumed a manner and look of\naffectation, such as may often have been observed in some\nself-approving beauty, who, conscious of her charms, feels that she\nis an object of admiration to all around her.  When I expressed my\ndisapprobation of her style of ornament, she stared at me with a look\nof surprise, which seemed to ask what I was saying.  I soon gave both\nher and the chief to understand, by signs; after which they seemed\nnot so well pleased with themselves or each other; and when I saw her\nagain in the evening she was without any ornament, and looked all the\nbetter for it.  While here, two grotesque figures came in and walked\nup to me with an austere look.  They had a profusion of cock's\nfeathers bound circularly round their brows, broad gorgets of wood\nornamented with red berries round their necks, shell bracelets and\nornaments of polished shell or bone tied above their ancles.  Each\nheld in his hand a fan of palmetto.  After standing a few moments,\nkeeping their eyes fixed upon me, they began jumping up and down and\nfanning themselves, applying both hands to the fan.  My first feeling\nwas surprise, mingled with curiosity, to know the cause of their\nstrange appearance; but when they had several times repeated their\nexercise, the scene was altogether so ridiculous that I could not\nrefrain from laughing.  They soon afterwards, without even noticing\nthe chief, turned and walked off.  After leaving the hut of the\nchief, I visited a number of others, all of which were nearly alike.\nIn one of them I saw two drums, the only instruments of music that I\nmet with.  The largest of them was a hollow log, from three to four\nfeet long, and about a foot and a half in diameter, covered at both\nends with shark skin.  I asked the owner to play upon it, to which he\nreadily consented, seeming highly flattered with the invitation.  He\naccompanied his voice by thumping his hands and elbows on the\ndrum-head; but the music that he made was intolerable.  He beat,\nhowever, in very good time, and had evidently a high opinion of his\nperformance.\n\nIn the course of our ramble, one of the officers told an Indian, who\nhad joined us, by signs, that he wanted some cocoa-nuts.  The\ngood-natured fellow acquiesced without the least hesitation, and to\nour great astonishment, ran up a tree standing near us, with the\nactivity of a squirrel.  The tree was forty or fifty feet high,\nhaving but a slight inclination, yet the climbing seemed to occasion\nhim scarcely any exertion.  They do not press their bodies against\nthe tree and hitch themselves up as is customary with us, which, in\ntheir naked condition, they could not do without injury.  They press\nthe bottoms of their feet against the tree, and clinging to it with\ntheir hands one above the other, ascend upon all-fours.  It did not\nstrike us with less surprise when he had thrown the cocoa-nuts down,\nto see with what facility he stripped off the hard husks without the\naid of any thing but his teeth.  For such a thing to have been\naccomplished by one of us would be found impossible.  We afterwards\nremarked the same practise in other places, and at other islands.  It\nwas general except with the old men, who, unless they were very\nrobust, used a sharp-pointed stick of hard wood to remove the husk.\n\nThey could not understand our practice of shaking hands.  When we\nextended a hand to one of them as a mark of friendly salutation, they\nlooked as though they would question what was meant by it; and from\ntheir manner seemed to think that our object was to feel their skin,\nwhich they would always reciprocate by raising up our sleeves and\nexamining very minutely.\n\nOn the morning of the 29th of September, which was the last of our\nremaining in Comptroller's Bay, I made another excursion to the Typee\nBay, taking with me the chief of the Happahs, who was very anxious to\ngo.  I wondered at this, as the tribes evinced so much dislike to\neach other; but afterwards saw, in my intercourse with the natives of\nthe South Sea Islands, that uncivilized men are capable of as much\nduplicity towards each other as the educated and refined.  When we\nhad arrived within a hundred yards of the shore we were met by the\nchief with whom I had formed an acquaintance on the preceding day.\nHe saluted the chief of the Happahs in a way that indicated a former\nacquaintance, but with a look and manner somewhat formal.  The Typee\nchief immediately spoke to some one near him, who ran off and in a\nfew minutes returned with a calabash filled with a preparation of the\nbread-fruit, upon which was poured a quantity of milk expressed from\na cocoa-nut.  This was offered by the Typee to the Happah chief, and\nI was also invited to partake of it.  I tasted and found it very\npalatable.  The two chiefs seated themselves in the stern of the\nboat, and made a hearty breakfast, using their fingers instead of\nspoons.  Neither of them seemed very communicative, as only a few\nwords passed between them at this interview.  There was also in the\nboat a young woman belonging to the chief's family, for whom\nbreakfast was brought in the shell of a cocoa-nut, and which was a\npreparation of the cocoa-nut and bread-fruit, sour and disagreeable\nto the taste.  This, I was informed, is the food upon which the women\nalmost entirely subsist, they being Tabooed from eating whatever is\nheld in high estimation by the men.  When the chiefs had finished\ntheir repast, the Typee pointed to his hogs, which he had again\ncaused to be brought down upon the beach, saying that he wanted\npowder or guns for them, but unfortunately I had neither of these\nvaluable articles with which to make an exchange with him, and he\nwould consider nothing else as an equivalent.  He sent for several\nold muskets that were very much out of order, and proposed to go on\nboard with me and have them repaired, making me understand by signs,\nthat he would in return present me with hogs.  His anxiety was so\ngreat upon this subject, that I found it difficult to put a stop to\nhis solicitations.  In the mean time, however, I saw the schooner\nunderway, and dismissing my Typee friends, pulled away for the Happah\nBay.  When I had approached within half a mile of the Happah village,\nthe schooner was almost out of the harbour, and the chief observing\nthat I was anxious to get on board, proposed jumping into the water\nand swimming home, to which I readily consented.  He then stripped\nhimself of his neck and ear ornaments, which consisted of two white\npieces of polished shell and a carved image of bone, and presenting\nthem to me as a token of his regard, plunged into the water, leaving\nme free to pursue my way to the vessel without the trouble of landing\nhim.  Most of the ornaments worn by these people, are of bone or\nshells, finely polished or rudely carved.  They attach a number of\nthem to a piece of cocoa-nut twine, and wear them around their necks,\nor wrists, or ancles, as may be most agreeable to the taste and fancy\nof the individuals.  A more expensive and difficult ornament to\nobtain is a gorget.  It is a piece of wood, semi-circular, about\nthree inches wide, carved to fit the neck, covered with a beautiful\nred and black berry, and stuck on with a gum that oozes from the tree\nof the bread-fruit.  On the hill that rises to the left of the\nvalley, we planted a variety of seeds of fruit, vegetables and grain,\nbut the natives of the valley are so totally ignorant of every thing\nthat relates to agriculture, that it is not probable they will ever\nderive any advantage from them.  Whilst we were in Happah Bay, the\nweather was clear and delightful.  The temperature so regular that no\nchange was felt in the transition from day to night.\n\nOn the 30th of September, we stood out of Comptroller's Bay, and ran\ndown for Massachusetts' Bay, a place made familiar to our countrymen\nby Commodore Porter's long and interesting visit.  The two points\nthat form the harbours of Comptroller's and Massachusetts' Bays, are\nabout seven miles distant from each other.  At one, P.M., we were\nclear of the projecting southern point of Comptroller's Bay, and at\nthree, P.M., anchored in eight fathoms water, within half a mile of\nthe hill at the bottom of the bay, called Porter's Monument.  Before\nwe came to anchor, the water was covered with canoes, and people of\nboth sexes and all ages swimming towards us, and as soon as the\nvessel lost her head way, they were crawling up on all sides like so\nmany rats.  They were not less delighted with our arrival than were\nthe Happahs.  Hundreds were collected on the shore, and all\nexpressing their satisfaction by songs and dances.  Amongst our first\nvisitors, were two English sailors who had deserted from whale ships,\nand been long enough resident on the island to converse in the\nlanguage of the natives.  With them came also a native of Nooaheeva,\nand a native of Otaheite, both of whom had served a considerable time\nin whale ships, and could converse in broken English.  We were\ntherefore in no want of interpreters, and it seemed at once to\nintroduce us to the confidence and friendship of our new\nacquaintances.\n\nThe harbour of Massachusetts' Bay is spacious and affords good\nanchorage for ships of the largest class.  The only part of it,\nhowever, where landing is not attended with difficulty and some\ndanger, is the east side, where there is a fine sand beach from a\nquarter to half a mile long, at one extremity of which empties a\nsmall rivulet of pure and excellent water into the bay.  Landing may\nbe effected at the watering-place beyond Porter's Monument, where\nthere is a more considerable stream of fresh water, but it is always\ndifficult, and when the surf is high, cannot fail to be dangerous.\nAt this place we watered the Dolphin; but had to swim the casks to\nand from the shore, and altogether, it was a laborious undertaking.\nAlong the east and north part of the bay there is a long reef that\nmakes at a short distance from the shore, upon which a heavy surf is\nalways breaking.  In entering the bay, the whole habitable part of\nthis section of the island is presented at one view, and forms a most\ngrand and beautiful landscape.  It is nearly semi-circular, and rises\nlike an amphitheatre, in fruitful and populous circular ranges of\nhills, until at the distance of several miles, it terminates in a\ncircumference of high and gloomy mountains, the tops of which\nresemble a massive wall.  This rude and barren circle of mountain\ncontrasts finely with the fertile ranges below, covered with their\nforests of cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees, and huts and villages\nevery where scattered about through hill and dale.  Nor is the\nextreme elevation without its interest and beauty.  A number of\nlittle cataracts reflecting the rays of the sun and looking like\nsheets of liquid silver, break in upon the gloom of the sterile rock,\nadding brilliancy as they descend to the lively prospect below.\nAfter a shower, not less than fifty of these splendid falls of water\nmay be seen, some of which are but just perceptible through the\nintervening space between hills and trees, producing an effect\npeculiarly agreeable.  What is called Porter's Monument, is a round\nhill from fifty to an hundred feet high, situated at the east\nextremity of the bay.  It was here that Commodore Porter had his\nFort, not a vestige of which is now remaining.  It is overrun with a\nwild luxuriant growth of vines and grass, and no trace of a footstep\ncan be found.  On one side of the hill, near its base, was stretched\na bark line, which was attended by a man who calls himself Opotee,\nand who declares the hill beyond it to be tabooed.  Upon one\noccasion, as I was approaching it, some natives called out \"Taboo,\nTaboo!\" but Opotee immediately expressed his willingness that I\nshould pass, as I was a countryman of his namesake, Opotee.  To the\nnorth of Porter's Monument, and back from the sand beach, where was\nthe navy-yard, all is now overgrown with bushes and trees, some of\nwhich have attained to a considerable size.  Like the monument, there\nis no indication of its ever having been occupied for any human\npurpose,\n\nOn the first of October, the day after our arrival, I went on shore,\ntaking with me a great variety of seeds, for the purpose of planting\nthem where it was most probable they would be taken care of and come\nto maturity.  The natives flocked round me in great numbers.  There\nwas not less than a hundred boys with the crowd of men and women that\nfollowed me.  They were highly delighted when they discovered my\nobject, which was explained to them by John Luxon, the native of\nNooaheeva, who spoke English.  Whenever we came to a rough or muddy\nplace, which was frequently the case, the boys and men,\nnotwithstanding my remonstrances, would mount me on their shoulders\nand carry me over, with loud shouting.  I could easily perceive that\nthis was a frolic with those who engaged in it, and done out of\nlevity and the caprice of the moment; but I could not but feel that\nthey had been first stimulated to it by the favourable impression\nthey had conceived of my design.  I planted some things in\nunfrequented places where I found a clear spot, but most of the seeds\nand fruit-pits, in the enclosures of the natives.  John Luxon was a\nman of some rank as a chief, and possessed considerable property.  To\none of his enclosures that was large and seemed to have been attended\nwith unusual care, I devoted most of my attention.  There, aided by\nseveral of the natives, who laboured with great assiduity, I prepared\nthe ground and made quite an extensive plantation of orange, lemon,\ncheromaya, peach, apricot, water-melons, pumpkins, potatoes, onions,\nbeans, corn, and a variety of other fruits and grain, from Peru.  He\nexpressed himself in terms of the warmest gratitude, and I have no\ndoubt that the natives have already experienced the most important\nbenefits from the memento I left them of the Dolphin's visit to their\nIsland.\n\nIn the course of my days' occupation, I was several times driven into\nLuxon's house by the frequent showers that came over.  I no sooner\nentered, than the natives flocked after me, and in a few minutes the\nhut would be crowded.  The little boys and girls here shewed me the\nsame officious attention that I received in making my way to the\nvillage, but expressed in a different manner.  As many as could\napproach would surround me with their fans, keeping them going until\nthe rain ceased, and I was again enabled to resume my work.  This was\na kind of civility, peculiarly agreeable, as the weather was\noppressively warm; but I could not fail to discover that my little\nattendants were all candidates for my friendly notice and bestowed\ntheir civility with the expectation of some reward.  I had a few\ntrifles about me, but not enough to give to all, and felt at a loss\nin what way I should make my presents, fearing that the least\nfavoured would be mortified and displeased.  It seemed however to\nmake no difference.  It was all \"motake\"[5] with them.  All seemed\nsatisfied.  On my return to the beach, I found it thronged with men,\nwomen, and children.  All the beauty and fashion of Massachusetts'\nBay had assembled in honour of our arrival, decked out in their\nfinest tappas, and gayest colours.  The females were dressed in the\nbest style of their island, with neat turbans of tappa-cloth, white,\nor ornamented with colours, a white robe of the same material thrown\nloosely over them, tastefully knotted on one shoulder, concealing\nhalf the bosom, and a wrapper round the waist that reached below the\nknee.  They were arranged in groups of a dozen each, singing merrily\nand clapping their hands in time to the music of their voices.  A\nlittle way from them the men were seated in the same manner and\nsimilarly occupied.  The ladies, to improve their charms, had used an\nabundant quantity of cocoa-nut oil, which filled the air with its\nnauseous perfumes for an hundred yards round.  Many of them had more\nhighly anointed themselves with yellow paint, which, with the\ncocoa-nut oil, was running from them in streams.  Some had decorated\nthemselves with necklaces of a golden yellow fruit which bears a\nstrong resemblance to a pine-apple, and emits a powerful offensive\nsmell.  At a distance, with their variegated robes flying in the\nwind, their appearance was altogether agreeable, and upon a near\napproach the scene was animated beyond description.  The dusk of\nevening was the signal for their dispersion, when some went one way\nand some another.  On the second of October, I wandered back upon the\nhills, and had all the boys with me that followed me on the preceding\nday.\n\nThey renewed their frolic of carrying me, and whenever I seated\nmyself, came round me as many as could approach, each with a green\nleaf for a fan.  I entered unceremoniously a number of the huts,\nwhere I almost always found one or more men, in nearly every\ninstance, extended on their backs, their heads resting on a log laid\nalong on one side of the hut, and their heels on another, about four\nfeet from the first.  They would never rise to receive me, but utter\n\"motake,\" when I was perceived by them, and make motions for me to do\nas they did, offering me at the same time a fan, one of which they\nwere using almost constantly.  In the course of my ramble, I met with\na little girl, twelve or fourteen years old, who was very pretty,\nattended by a servant, the only instance in which I remarked such a\nthing on the island.  She was evidently walking out to make a visit,\nand had just arrived at the house of her destination when I met her.\nI put some beads round her neck, which seemed to delight her very\nmuch; but an old man present, whose hut she was about to visit,\nassumed an angry look, and seemed to threaten by his manner.  He\nchanged his conduct, however, when I made him a trifling present, and\nthe little girl, taking my hand, led me to her father's hut.  He was\na chief of some consequence, as was indicated by the possession of\ntwo or three casks of powder, and six muskets.  These he took down,\nand displayed very ostentatiously, and wanted to know if I had not\nothers to dispose of.  His conduct was altogether kind and\nhospitable, in acknowledgment for which I made him a present at my\ndeparture.  Whenever I wanted cocoa-nuts to quench my thirst, I had\nonly to signify it to one of the men that was following me about, and\nhe would supply me from the nearest tree.  With one fellow I was very\nmuch amused.  He carried his arms full of cocoa-nuts following me\nabout nearly all day, and when I returned to the vessel I presented\nhim with a musket ball, with which he was perfectly satisfied, said\nit was \"motake,\" and went away.  When I returned to the beach in the\nevening, I found the natives, male and female, assembled in as great\nnumbers as on the day previous, and amusing themselves in the same\nway.  The females were again in their finest attire, and at a\ndistance might any where else have been mistaken for an assemblage of\nfashionable belles.  We were apprehensive that our men, a number of\nwhom were at work on shore, would have been very much annoyed by the\nintrusion of the natives.  This, however, was not the case.  When\nthey commenced their work in the morning a circle was made,\ncomprehending the whole space we wished them to occupy, which we told\nthe natives was tabooed, and there was not an instance of their\npassing it.  The next day they held quite a fair on the beach.\nAmongst other things, they had for trade large quantities of\ncocoa-nuts and bread-fruit.  The former they exchanged for small\npieces of tobacco; but a piece of iron hoop, fashioned into a tool or\ninstrument of husbandry, was demanded for the latter.  They were all\nday on the beach, cooking and eating their bread-fruit and\ncocoa-nuts.  In the evening, the boys and men amused us with playing\nsoldiers, by ranging themselves in a line with sticks for muskets.\nOne of our officers took a particular pleasure in making grimaces,\nand talking a gibberish to the natives in imitation of their manner\nof speaking.  It was very offensive to them; but they respected us\ntoo much to betray their displeasure.  Upon one occasion, however, he\namused himself in this way with the boys, about a hundred of whom\nwere assembled, when I encouraged them to retaliate on him, by\nclucking like a hen.  They soon discovered that it was disagreeable\nto him, and assembled round him like so many little furies, clucking\nwith all their might.  It seemed to delight them to have an\nopportunity of revenging themselves upon him, which they did most\namply, for they did not let him rest a moment until he went on board,\nwhich was soon afterwards, highly displeased with me for conspiring\nwith the Indians against him.  We were often amused with the strange\nand ridiculous taste of the natives in the article of dress.\n\nThey were all desirous of obtaining clothes, and a number of old\ngarments were given them, or exchanged for curiosities by the\nofficers and crew.  When obtained, whether they fitted or not, the\nIndians immediately put them on, and scarcely ever more than one\ngarment at a time.  Thus, half naked and half attired, a native would\nwalk about with exceeding gravity, admiring himself, and believing\nthat every one else was equally pleased with his genteel appearance.\n\nWhenever they seated themselves to sing, a person was selected to\noccupy a conspicuous station, and perform a dance round the circle,\nslowly, and in the most graceful native style, striking at the same\ntime the hollow of his left arm with his right hand, in time with the\nmusic of their voices.  This distinction was always conferred upon\nsome one who had obtained an old jacket or tattered shirt.  If he had\non a jacket, it was sure to be buttoned closely round him, with the\ntwo or three remaining buttons, and the sleeves, if not torn off,\nwould probably not reach more than half the length of his arms.  Thus\nattired, he would perform his evolutions round the circle slowly, and\nwith a most serious air, stopping occasionally to receive the\napplause of the singers, who bestowed it upon him with great\nenthusiasm.  Soon after daylight, one morning I was on the beach, and\nmy curiosity led me to a place, where a number of females were busily\nemployed in collecting something from the rocks.  When I approached\nthem they discontinued their occupation, and would have fled, but I\ncalled them back, and prevailed upon them to renew their occupation.\nEach of them was provided with a green leaf, in which she was\ngathering from the rocks a species of fine green sea moss and small\nsnails.  What they preserved in the leaf was intended for their\nfamilies at home.  They ate freely of them, and said it was \"motake.\"\nThe moss was tender, but to me had no other taste than that of salt\nwater, with which it was covered at high tide.  The snails were not\nlarger than a pea, covered with a hard shell, and when broken, heated\nthe tongue like pepper.  The moss, when gathered, had a most\ndisgusting appearance.  I was told by the Englishmen, residing here,\nthat the natives esteem it a very great delicacy.  One of the females\nhad an infant with her a few months old, which she was teaching to\nswim by holding it in a pool of water, and occasionally letting it\ngo.  The infant would make a slight effort, when let go by the\nmother, and, no doubt, was taught to swim almost as soon as it could\nwalk.  On the third of October, in walking through the habitable part\nof the valley, I was every where met by females, who addressed me\nwith a smile, and finely modulated tone of voice, \"Coare ta\nwhyhene?\"[6]  The father of one of these, good naturedly conducted me\nto the hut of a chief, highest in blood of any in the valley.  He was\na man upwards of fifty, and apparently more civilized than any of the\nnatives I had seen before.  He told the interpreter to say, that he\nfelt pleasure in seeing me at his hut.  It was about forty by twenty\nfeet, and constructed in the same way as that occupied by the Happah\nchief, differing in no respect from those of the common people,\nexcept in dimensions.  His rank and importance was displayed in the\npossession of six muskets, and two casks of powder that hung directly\nfronting the door, and which the chief took occasion to point out to\nme soon after I entered.  To him they were a treasure, and, in fact,\nthe wealth and consequence of every individual seemed to be estimated\nby this standard alone.  The powder was covered over with canvass,\nand the muskets highly polished.  On one side of the hut were two\nlogs, about three feet apart, and between them a coarse mat, for the\nconvenience of laying down on, one log being intended for the head,\nand the other for the feet.  Whilst I was here, a number of visitors\ncame in, and, walking directly to the logs, without noticing any one,\nthrew themselves down between them, their heads on one, and feet on\nthe other, where they lay, fanning themselves, and looking at us,\nwithout saying a word, except once or twice, when they saw me looking\nat them, I was saluted with \"motake.\"  In the middle of the hut was\nthe coffin of the chief's father, who had died about six months\nprevious.  It was the trunk of a large bread-fruit tree, six or eight\nfeet long, highly polished, and the lid so ingeniously fitted, that\nthe place of contact could not be seen but by the closest\nexamination.  He told me that his father had been a great warrior,\nand the friend of Opotee.[7]  Before his door was a swivel, and a\nnumber of shot, that he said he had obtained from Opotee.  He prized\nthem very highly, although they could not be of the least use to him,\nexcept as they served to gratify his vanity.  When I expressed a\ndesire to know the manner in which they prepared the paint, used by\nthe females, he directed his son to get some of the root, and grind\nit between two stones, mixing a little water with it, the only\nprocess required.  I gave the chief's wife (who was an old woman)\nsome beads, and a cotton handkerchief, with which she was so\ndelighted, that she threw both her arms around my neck, and embraced\nme most affectionately.  She was painted all over, quite yellow, and\nso thoroughly smeared my clothes, that I paid dearly for this\nexpression of her regard.  At parting, the chief presented me with a\nhog (the only one we obtained at the Marquesas), some sticks of the\ntappa tree, and offered whatever was acceptable to me, about his\nhouse.  We also exchanged names, and I promised again to visit him,\nbut had no opportunity afterwards.  His son accompanied me on board,\ncarrying the presents his father had made me, and all the way calling\nme \"Kappe,\" the name of his father, and himself, by my name.\n\nIn the evening, when I returned to the vessel, she was crowded with\nnatives, the work of the day being completed.  The men and women were\nin different circles, singing their songs.  That of the women,\nresembled the croaking of a great many frogs.  The quick and lively\nmotion of their hands, accompanying the various modulations of the\nvoice, exhibited a great activity, and command of muscle, and was far\nmore pleasing than their music.  There was one amongst the females,\nwho possessed great powers of voice, in the utterance of strange\nsounds, in which none of the rest could accompany her.  The\nperformance seemed to distress her very much, and was certainly very\ndisagreeable; yet the natives would all stop occasionally, to listen\nto her, and, when she was done, exclaimed, with seeming surprise,\n\"motake!\"\n\nOn the 4th of October, I took a boat, prepared with arms, and\nproviding myself with a few presents, ran down for Lewis' Bay, to\nascertain the depth of water at the entrance of the harbour, what\ndifficulties might probably attend our running in with the schooner,\nand whether it afforded any better prospect than the other places we\nhad visited, of obtaining a supply of hogs.  The distance was only\nsix miles, and, with a fine breeze, we were at the entrance of the\nharbour in little more than an hour.  It was very narrow, formed by\ntwo high points of land, and the depth of water abundantly sufficient\nfor ships of the largest class.  A heavy and broken swell made the\nentrance appear difficult: and, without a fair wind, it is so\nconfined, that it would be hazardous to attempt it; but the gorge\nbeing once passed, you enter a large smooth basin, where there is\nscarcely a ripple, the land rising high all around it, and the points\nlocking with each other.  In the basin we found good anchorage, in\nfrom four to nine fathoms water, and a clay bottom.  Lewis' Bay is\ndivided into two parts by a projecting point of rocks.  I first\nlanded in that which fronts the entrance, or rather went into the\nedge of the surf.  A great many people, of all ages, came swimming\noff through the surf, and in a few moments the boat was full of them,\nand of fruit of various kinds.  They were anxious for me to land, but\nI saw there would be great difficulty in my getting off again, in the\nevent of any misunderstanding with them, which was not altogether\nimpossible.  I did not remain long, but, dismissing the natives who\nhad crawled into the boat, or were hanging on the gunwale, pulled\nround the point of rocks to the other landing.  When first I went\ninto this part of the harbour, I could perceive only two or three\npersons, who were afraid to come near us.  They gradually relaxed in\ntheir timidity, however, and kept nearing us a little, until we at\nlast prevailed upon them to get into the boat.  As soon as they saw\nour muskets, which they thought were intended for trade; but which\nwere only for our protection, they ran away, saying, they would bring\nus hogs directly.  In the mean time the news of our arrival spread,\nfar and wide, over the valley, and the people came running from every\ndirection, with whatever they could most readily possess themselves\nof, for trade.  Every body wanted muskets, and a chief had seven or\neight hogs brought to the beach, all of which he offered for one gun.\nAfter spending an hour or two here, on the most friendly terms with\nthe natives, I prepared to depart, and missed one of my shoes, that I\nhad thrown off wet.  Search was made in the boat, without finding it,\nwhen it was remarked, that a native had been seen crawling in the\nwater for a considerable distance to a rock near the shore, where he\ndeposited something, and returned.  Upon examination, we found the\nshoe wrapped up in a piece of tappa cloth, the Indian having stolen\nit, without reflecting that the possession of one shoe, without the\nother, was of no value to him, or perhaps not caring whether it was\nor not, so that he gratified his propensity to steal.  When I\nreturned a short distance, and held the shoe up to show the natives\nthat I had recovered it, they set up a loud laugh, which I\ninterpreted into applause, of the ingenious exploit of their\ncountryman.  The valley of Lewis' Bay is not to be compared to either\nof the other places we visited on the island, for beauty or\nfertility.  It is, however, quite populous, and the scenery is grand\nand picturesque.  The land gradually rises from a small plain below,\nlike the valley occupied by the Typees, in a succession of hills, and\nterminates in a perpendicular high ledge of rocks.  In returning from\nLewis' to Massachusetts' Bay, the wind was ahead, and we pulled close\nin with the shore, which, for nearly the whole distance, rises\nabruptly, from the ocean, to the height of six or seven hundred feet.\nNumerous falls, which were only perceptible in heavy mist, before\nthey reached the water, were leaping from the top, whilst the sea\nbeat the sides with unceasing fury, throwing its spray to the height\nof more than a hundred feet.  Whilst we were tugging at our oars,\ncontemplating this magnificent scene, the sea suddenly became\nunusually agitated, and threatened, at every instant, to swallow up\nthe boat.  We pulled directly from the shore, and for half an hour\nour situation was very critical, after which the sea became regular.\nA phenomenon, so remarkable, baffled all our speculation, and we were\nentirely at a loss to determine respecting its cause.  On our arrival\non board, we learned that the vessel had narrowly escaped being\ndriven on shore in a squall It was not the fault of the anchorage,\nbut in consequence of the baffling winds which had several times\ndriven the vessel over her anchor, whereby it was fouled by the\ncable, and tripped with the violence of the squall.\n\nThe natives, as usual, were assembled on the shore near us, amusing\nthemselves in their customary way, by singing and dancing.  The\nfemales, having learned from some of the Dolphin's crew, that it was\nnot in good taste to use cocoa-nut oil, and paint, in such profusion,\nleft it off, as well as the golden yellow fruit, which had also been\nhighly disapproved of.  It improved their appearance, and they seemed\nto be sensible of the superior estimation in which they were held.\nThese wild ladies, in truth, who, on our first arrival, came swimming\nround, like so many mermaids, grew very fastidious in the short time\nwe remained at their island.  After the first day or two, they\nrequested to be allowed to go on board, in our boats, and then,\nseeing some of the officers carried through the surf by the seamen,\nnothing less would please them, when they did us the honour of a\nvisit, but to be gallanted on board with the same ceremony.  Our\nsailors gallantly condescended to gratify two or three of them; but,\ninstead of taking them to the boat, they most uncourteously let them\nfall into the first heavy roller they encountered, leaving them to\nthe choice of swimming to the boat, or back to the shore again, after\nwhich none ever asked to be carried.  With regard to their\nsuperstitions or worship, we could learn but little.  John Luxon told\nme, that he was tabooed by his father, who was a chief, and that no\ncommon man dared to pass over his head.  He was usually dressed in a\nsailor's shirt and trowsers, and an old hat.  He came off regularly\nevery morning, and ate with us three time a day, taking his seat at\nthe table, without the least ceremony, and never waiting to be asked.\n\nOne day, some one had, designedly or accidentally, thrown some bread\nin John's hat, which he did not perceive when he took it up, and put\nit on.  When he felt the bread upon his head, he threw his hat off\ninstantly, and, with a look of the utmost horror, exclaimed, \"who put\ndat dare?  Me Taboo here!\" (putting his hand on his head) \"To-morrow\nme sick, me die!\"  This, he repeated over a number of times, and with\ngreat earnestness of manner tried to find out who had put the bread\nin his hat, insisting upon it, that, on the morrow, he should sicken\nand die.  The morrow, however, came, and John was alive and well, and\nwas heartily laughed at for his foolish superstition, when he came on\nboard as usual to spend the day with us.  I do not believe that John\nhad the same implicit faith in taboo afterwards.  I tried to find out\nfrom him what was meant by his being tabooed, but he spoke English so\nbadly, and seemed to understand so little of the matter himself, that\nI was not much the wiser for his explanation.  We were told here,\nthat, a few years since, the missionaries at the Society Islands,\nmoved by the benevolent purpose of converting the Marquesas islanders\nto Christianity, sent one of their number to reside at Massachusetts'\nBay.  The missionary landed amongst his charge, by whom he was\nreceived with characteristic kindness and hospitality.  No other\nnotice was taken of him, however, than would have been bestowed upon\nthe most poor and ignorant mariner, seeking an asylum amongst them.\nHe was permitted to fix upon his place of residence, and live in such\nway as pleased him best.  He soon commenced preaching the doctrines\nof his faith.  The natives listened to him, wondering at all he said,\nbut not less at his singular manner of life,--to them unexampled, in\nall their acquaintance with the whites,--and, certainly, unparalleled\namongst themselves.  They had always seen the white men, who visited\ntheir islands, take liberties with their females, and mingle with\nthem in all their pleasures, whilst this man, who called himself a\nmessenger from the Great Spirit, lived a life of celibacy, retired\nfrom all that, to them, was amusing or agreeable.  When a free\ninterchange of opinion had taken place amongst them, respecting him,\nthey came to the conclusion, that he was differently made and\nconstituted from all other men they had ever seen, and curiosity\nbeing raised to the highest pitch, they, with a levity peculiar to\nsavages, determined to subject him to a scrutiny.  The missionary,\nalarmed at a disposition that evinced so little respect for his\ncharacter and personal rights, took his departure by the first\nopportunity, since which no attempt has been made to convert the\nnatives of the Marquesas to Christianity.\n\nThe men of the Marquesas, were, in general, quite naked.  But few\nornaments were worn by either sex.  The women frequently had no other\nornament than a small flower, stuck through a slit in their ears.\nSome of the men wore polished whale's teeth round their necks, and\nsome shell bracelets, but they were not in common use.  A few were\ntattooed all over, and others but slightly.  The mode of their\ntattooing seemed to be altogether a matter of fancy.  Some had\nindulged the most whimsical taste, in having indelibly pricked into\ntheir flesh, fish, birds, and beasts, of all kinds known to them.\nOthers were tattooed black, even to the inner part of their lips.  It\nis an art in high estimation amongst them.  There are men, who pursue\nit as a regular business, and are in great favour with their\ncountrymen, for their skilful performance.  The women tattoo more\ntastefully than the men.  Their feet and legs, half-way to the knee,\nare usually covered with figures, wrought with great neatness, and\nthe right hand and arm, half-way to the elbow, is often similarly\nornamented.  Both men and women commonly wear their hair short, and\nwhen instances to the contrary are met with, the persons invariably\nhave a disgusting appearance, their hair hanging in long and\ndisagreeable looking matted locks.\n\nThe men are finely formed, large, and active; and both men and women\nwould, in many instances, be considered handsome, were it not for our\nfastidious objection to their copper colour.  Their teeth are very\nbeautiful, and formed a subject of remark to us all, while we were\namongst them.  I do not think that, of all the people that came under\nmy observation at Nooaheeva, there was a single one with bad teeth.\nThis is the more remarkable in the men, as they are accustomed all\ntheir lives to strip the husk of the cocoa-nut in the manner I have\ndescribed.\n\nA plurality of wives is not admitted amongst them under any\ncircumstances.  The sexes rarely live together, as man and wife,\nuntil they have arrived at the middle age of life.  When a man wishes\nto take a wife, he first obtains the consent of the female, who\nsolicits that of her friends, which, being obtained, the girl's\nfather kills a hog, or, if a chief, a number of hogs, and makes a\nfeast, to which all the friends of both parties are invited.  After\nthis ceremonial is performed, which is an occasion of great\nmerriment, the parents of the girl furnish her with a few pieces of\ntappa cloth, and she is conducted by her husband to his house.  The\nfemales, although invited to these feasts, are not permitted to\npartake of the hogs, roasted for the occasion.  They are tabooed for\nthe men alone.  Hogs are scarcely ever used by the natives, but upon\nthe occasion of a death or marriage.  When a chief, or other person\ndies, possessing many hogs, a great feast is made.  The only arms,\nthat are now generally used, are muskets.  Most of the natives, who\nhave any property, own one or more.  I did not see a single war club\nat Nooaheeva, and but few spears.  I met several persons, who had the\nscars of musket balls, that they told me were received in battle.\nEach of the renegade Englishmen was living with a chief, who thought\nthere was scarcely any thing that he could not perform.  Besides\nsupporting them, they gave them all the consequence of chiefs in\ntheir intercourse with the natives, so far as their own authority\nwould admit of it.  They were highly respected by the natives, and\neven John Luxon boasted to me of his superiority over the other\nIndians, in speaking English.  I asked John, of what advantage his\nspeaking English was to him, to which he replied, that it enabled him\nto cheat his countrymen.\n\nThe whole face of the island of Nooaheeva is high and mountainous.\nEvery part I visited is composed of volcanic cinders, and evidently\nowes its origin to some great convulsion of nature.  Whilst we\nremained at Massachusetts' Bay, the weather was mild and pleasant.\nWe had several heavy showers, which, in one instance, only was\naccompanied with a squall of wind.  After these showers it was\ndelightful to contemplate the beauty of the innumerable little\ncascades of water every where falling over the rocks from the tops of\nthe mountains.  In a few hours, many of them would become less\nbrilliant, and some would quite disappear.  We found the longitude of\nour anchorage by the mean of three chronometers, to be one hundred\nand thirty-nine degrees fifty-four minutes and thirty seconds west;\nlatitude, by a series of observations, eight degrees fifty-seven\nminutes forty-five seconds south.\n\nOctober the 5th, we got under way, and stood out with a light and\nbaffling wind, tacking very close in with both shores.  At nine,\nA.M., we passed the Sentinels, and bore up to the westward with a\nmoderate breeze from E.S.E.  The islands Rooahooga and Rooapooa, were\nplainly in sight.  In clear weather they may be seen at least fifty\nmiles.  The amiable character of the inhabitants of Nooaheeva, and\nthe friendly disposition they had evinced towards us upon all\noccasions, made us feel regret at leaving them so soon.  The course\nthat now lay before us, carried us away from all the civilized world;\nand the islands in our way affording but little to tempt navigators\nto visit them, were known to us only as places, existing on the wide\nsurface of the ocean, where, with few exceptions, the inhabitants had\nnever seen the face of a white man.  We could anticipate no other\ngratification from our contemplated visit to them, than the\nindulgence of our curiosity.  The weather became squally after our\ndeparture from the Marquesas, and continued so for several days,\nduring which time we were frequently deceived by the clouds assuming\nthe strongest appearance of land, for which we steered two or three\ntimes, under a full conviction that we had made a discovery.  We\ncould picture to ourselves, the mountains, and valleys, and bays,\nand, to confirm the deception, we frequently saw land birds flying\nabout us.\n\nAt day-light, on the 10th of October, we discovered Caroline Island,\nbearing W.S.W., and distant fourteen miles.  We were on the weather\nside of it, and a furious surf was every where in sight, breaking\nupon a reef some distance from the shore.  We stood along to the\nwestward, and at nine, A.M., passed a reef, that makes out from the\nN.W. end of the island, protecting it to the S.W. from the heavy\neasterly swell, and prevailing winds.  Under the lee of the reef, we\nstood in, with the hope of finding anchorage, getting frequent casts\nof the lead, until, to our great disappointment, it was discovered\nthat there was deep sea-water within a few feet of a bed of coral,\nthat stretched off three or four hundred yards from the shore,\nfarther to the south and west, a high surf was breaking, and this\nbeing the only place where we could land, and, desirous of exploring\nthe island, we took a small kedge to the coral bank, by which we rode\nto the easterly trade winds.  Here we landed without much difficulty,\nand made our way to the shore, over the coral, although it was full\nof holes, and looked as though it would give way under our feet.  The\nholes in the coral-bed were from one to three feet deep, and some of\nthem had the appearance of communicating with the ocean.  In these\nholes, we found an abundance of large and very fine fish, with which\nwe supplied the crew in great plenty.  They were of several different\nkinds, the best of which were the red grouper, and a long fish, of a\ndark colour, for which we had no name.  Boarding pikes and boat-hooks\nwere the only instruments we used for taking them, and by this simple\napparatus alone a frigate's crew might have been supplied in a short\ntime.  A boat was also sent to fish alongside of the coral bank,\nwhere were myriads of red grouper, of a large size; but the sharks\nwere so numerous, that, for every fish, we lost two or three hooks.\n\nThe tide rises, at Caroline Island, from three to four feet, and, at\nlow water, the coral-bank was nearly dry.  This was the case when we\nlanded, and, having remained there several hours, our fishing party\nwas surprised with a rise of the water, that made it difficult, and\nsomewhat dangerous for them to retrace their steps to the edge of the\nbank, the holes in many places not being perceptible, and the water\nin them over their heads.  What made their situation the more\ndisagreeable was the number of sharks that had come in with the tide,\nand which occasionally made a bite at their feet or legs.  One man,\nwho had a large bunch of fish which he trailed through the water, was\nso closely pursued, and fiercely attacked by them, that he was\ncompelled to take refuge upon a rock that lay in his way, from which\nhe could not again be prevailed upon to descend, until the boat went\nto his relief.  Caroline Island is uninhabited.  It is from five to\neight miles long, and no where in the vicinity of our anchorage more\nthan from a quarter to half a mile wide.  There are some trees of a\nlarge size upon it, and in most places a thick growth of underwood.\nIt is every where bounded by a bed of coral, which generally extends\nseveral hundred yards from the shore.  We saw no animals on it, and\nno other reptiles than small lizards.  Sea birds were tolerably\nnumerous, and a few sand snipe were seen.  On the weather side of the\nisland, we found a cocoa-nut tree, that, to all appearance, had but\nrecently drifted on shore.  Besides the cocoa-nut tree, we found two\narticles of Indian furniture.  That they came from an inhabited\nisland, there can be no doubt, and it is equally certain that the\nisland has never been discovered, as there is none laid down upon the\nchart, in the direction of the trade winds, from Caroline Island,\nnearer than the Society Islands.  The Marquesas are the nearest to\nCaroline, of any land known; and they are distant upwards of six\nhundred miles, and differ in their bearing a little from the general\ndirection of the trade winds.  On the cocoa-nut tree there were two\nnuts, which had the appearance of having been but a short time in the\nwater.  We planted them near our anchorage.  Caroline Island is low,\nand every where flat, with the exception of a few sand hillocks, that\nrise a little above the ordinary level.  It is no where more than\nfour or five feet above the sea.  We obtained a boat-load of\npepper-grass and pursely, of which there was a great abundance; and\non the 13th, at meridian, unhooked our kedge, and made sail to the\nwestward.  Our place of landing at Caroline Island, was south\nlatitude nine degrees fifty-four minutes thirty seconds; west\nlongitude, one hundred and fifty degrees eighteen seconds.\n\nPrevious to taking our departure from the coast of Peru, the\ncommander of the station had furnished us with a long list of\nislands, said to have been recently discovered by whalers, and we\nwere now in the vicinity of two of them, one of which was laid down\nin south latitude eight degrees forty minutes; and west longitude one\nhundred and fifty-nine degrees fifty minutes.  The other, in south\nlatitude, six degrees forty-two minutes; went longitude one hundred\nand sixty-six degrees ten minutes.  After our departure from Caroline\nIsland, we steered for the supposed new discovery, that was nearest\nto us, being that in latitude eight degrees forty seconds; and,\nhaving cruised two days in the vicinity, bore away, under a full\nconviction that it did not exist, or had been laid down incorrectly.\nIn our search for the other island, we were equally unsuccessful; and\nafter running down a degree or two of longitude, in its parallel of\nlatitude, continued on to the southward and westward, shaping our\ncourse for the Duke of Clarence Island.  Whilst we were looking for\nthese new discoveries, we were frequently deceived by the same false\nappearance of land, that I have noticed soon after our departure from\nthe Marquesas, and several times we saw land-birds[8] flying about\nthe vessel.\n\nAt four, A.M., on the 29th of October, we discovered the Duke of\nClarence Island ahead, twelve miles from us.  At day-light, the N.W.\nend was full in sight, and on each side of it, apparently at a great\ndistance, the tops of the trees could but just be seen through the\nhaze of the morning, looking as though they rose from the ocean.  As\nwe approached nearer, a great many islets rose to view, connected\nwith each other by a chain of coral reefs.  In sailing round them, we\ndiscovered that they formed a polygon, the sides of which were narrow\nstrips of land and coral reefs, comprehending within them a lake of\nmany miles in circumference.  When we first got close in with the\nisland, this lake, intervening between us and the most distant islets\nthat rose at the utmost limit of our vision, almost persuaded us, for\na time, that it was an extensive group, instead of one little island\nthat looked like a speck upon the general chart.  The lake was\neverywhere protected against the ocean, and so smooth, that not an\nundulation could be seen upon its surface.  The wind was light, the\nsea smooth,--the air had the mildness and elasticity of a spring\nmorning; and these deep green spots, upon the wide waste of ocean,\nwere truly beautiful.  The islets were low, rising but a few feet\nabove the water, and all covered with a thick growth of cocoa-nut\ntrees.  When we run down within a few miles of the shore to the\nwestward, where, near the beach, were a few huts, two canoes put off,\nand pulled for us with great rapidity, and shortly afterwards not\nless than twenty were in sight.\n\nAll this part of the shore was bounded by a coral reef, upon which\nwas breaking a heavy surf, and as we wished to anchor, and look for\nwater, we continued on for the leeward shore.  We were under easy\nsail, and the canoes kept way with us, constantly increasing in\nnumber, having, each of them, from four to seven men.  One of them\ncame very near us, and to save the natives the labour of working at\ntheir paddles, we threw them the end of a rope.  They laid hold of it\nvery eagerly, but instead of tying it to some part of their canoe, as\nwe expected they would have done, they hauled up by it as close to\nour stern as they could get, and made motions for us to give them\nmore.  We did so, and they again motioned us to veer to.  This, we\nthought unnecessary, as they had already sufficient for the purpose\nwe intended.  When they found that their solicitations for more were\nnot heeded, they very deliberately took a sharp instrument of bone or\nshell, and cut the rope off, having several fathoms in their canoe.\nAs soon as they had done this, they took to their paddles, and pulled\naway for us with all their might, and were soon again near enough to\nhave a rope thrown to them, which they called for as loud as they\ncould, making, at the same time, significant motions.  When they\nfound that we would not give them the rope again, they paddled up to\nour quarter, and one of them, who was a powerful man, came on board,\nwithout seeming to fear us in the least.  Several of the officers\nspoke to him, and tried to call his attention; but, without taking\nthe least notice of any body, he walked straight to the\nstern-netting, where he commenced most industriously to throw into\nhis canoe every thing that he could lay hands on.  The quarter-master\nand others, who were near, remonstrated with him, in vain, against\nsuch outrageous conduct.  Their interference seemed only to excite\nhis indignation, and make him the more active in accomplishing his\ndesign.  When we found that nothing else would prevail with him, I\ntook a musket that lay near me, and gave him a slight blow with it,\ncalling at the same time on some of the men, who stood near, to lay\nhold of him.  He seized the musket, when I struck him, and would have\ntaken me overboard with it, but for the timely assistance of those\nwho were near.  He made his escape before the men could get hold of\nhim, having succeeded in throwing into his canoe the log-reel and\nline, besides a number of other articles, that we could not\nconveniently spare.  We would have pursued the canoe, and taken from\nit the stolen articles, but they all moved with such rapidity, that\nwe had no hope of overtaking them, if we made the attempt.  When the\nnatives in the other canoes had witnessed the success of their\ncomrades in carrying off their booty, which they were displaying to\nthose around them, with great delight, they were encouraged to come\nnear, and make a similar attempt at plunder.  They were somewhat\ncautious, however, having witnessed the resistance we made.  The next\ntheft was that of breaking off one of the rudder-irons of the\nwaist-boat.  The captain, who was near, prevailed upon the fellow to\ngive it up, which he did, without the least hesitation; but,\nremaining quietly where he was, he seized the opportunity, when the\ncaptain's face was turned from him, and, snatching the piece of iron\nout of his hands, jumped overboard, and swam to the nearest canoe.\nWe were all the time close in with the shore, getting frequent casts\nof the deep sea lead, and the moment it was overboard, and the line\nwas seen by the natives, they made for it in a dozen canoes, and with\ninstruments of sharp shells, fastened to sticks, endeavoured to cut\nit off.  They paid not the slightest attention to our remonstrances\nand threats, and the only way in which we could prevent them from\neffecting their object, was by hauling the line in as fast as\npossible.\n\nAfter running along the shore for several miles, seeking in vain for\nanchorage, we began to examine the reefs, that connected the islets,\nwith great solicitude, in the hope of finding an opening into the\nlake, whore we should be protected from the wind and sea.  Of this,\nhowever, we soon despaired, and passing the south-west point of the\nisland, a bountiful little bay opened to our view, upon the shore of\nwhich the surf beat less violently than we had seen it elsewhere.\nHere we hove to, and sent a boat in shore to look for anchorage.  She\nsoon returned with a report that, within less than half a cable's\nlength of the shore, no bottom could be found, with upwards of a\nhundred fathoms of line.  We now gave up all intention of anchoring,\nand permitted the natives to come alongside, and exchange whatever we\nhad, that was mutually acceptable to each other.  They had continued\nto follow us, and, growing bold with their numbers, frequently threw\non board of the vessel clubs, cocoa-nuts, or whatever they had in\ntheir canoes, that could be used as missiles.  This was accompanied\nby such a loud shouting, and they had become so numerous, that the\norders for the ordinary duty of the vessel could not be heard.  Some\nof their clubs were so large, as to be capable of inflicting a fatal\nblow by the violence with which they were thrown, and our\napprehensions of suffering some evil consequence from this licentious\nconduct of our new acquaintances, were soon realised, by one of them\nstriking the surgeon upon the head.  He was in ill health, and had\njust come upon deck to witness the novel spectacle around us, when\nthe unwelcome salutation was given.  It alarmed us at first for his\nsafety; but, to our gratification, we discovered that his hat had so\nfar protected his head, that the wound was not severe.  As soon as\nthe natives saw the schooner heave to, they closed around us, and as\nmany as could get alongside, came with whatever they had to offer.\nNearly a hundred canoes were assembled, and in them several hundred\nmen.  When they saw us hoisting out our boat for the purpose of\nsounding, they became alarmed, and took to flight.  No inducement\ncould prevail upon them to come near us, whilst the boat lay\nalongside, and as soon as she shoved off, they took to their paddles,\nand retreated as fast as they could; but when they saw that she took\na different direction, and it was not her object to pursue them, they\nall turned and followed her.  They gathered around her at a short\ndistance, apparently afraid to approach nearer, at first making signs\nfor her to go on shore, where was a numerous group of men, women, and\nchildren, inviting our people to land.  Seeing that the boat would\nnot go on shore, and after the duty assigned had been accomplished,\nthat she was returning to the schooner, the natives with one accord\nclosed more nearly around her, as if to intercept her passage.  The\nofficer in the boat made threats and signs for them to retire, to\nwhich they paid not the slightest attention.  A canoe came on each\nside of the boat, and the natives laid hold of the oars, a man rising\nin each canoe at the same time, with a barbed spear, which he held in\nthe attitude of throwing.  The officer, feeling that his situation\nwas a very critical one, and thinking that the report of his pocket\npistol would cause them to desist, presented it with a design to fire\nahead of one of the canoes.  It did not go off, but the snap was a\nsignal sufficient for our men to prepare for their defence, believing\nthey were exposed to the greatest danger.  They seized their pistols,\nwith one of which each man was provided, and before the officer could\ninterfere to prevent them from firing (the noise and confusion\namongst the natives being such, that he could not be heard) one of\nthe men discharged his piece, and the ball passed through the hand of\none of the natives.  They became alarmed at the extraordinary report\nof the pistol, and immediately after it, seeing the blood flow from\nthe hand of their countryman, discontinued their assault, and retired\nwith precipitation.  The boat then returned to the schooner\nunmolested, the natives flying from her in every direction as she\napproached them.  We were apprehensive that the report of the pistol,\nand the wounding one of the natives would produce so great a panic\namongst them, as to interrupt our farther intercourse.  But in this\nwe were agreeably disappointed, for the boat was no sooner hoisted\nin, than they came alongside, with as much confidence, as though\nnothing of the kind had occurred.  In an hour afterwards, the wounded\nman was seen in a canoe, fifty or a hundred yards from us, apparently\nafraid to come nearer.  He was distinguished by having his hand bound\nup in green leaves.  After making motions to him, and those around\nus, and holding up a variety of things for his acceptance, he was at\nlast prevailed upon to come near us.  When he saw the sentinel, in\nthe gangway, he stopped, and we in vain held up our presents for him,\nuntil the sentinel was removed.  He then came on board, and suffered\nhis wound to be examined and dressed, trembling and staring around\nhim, like one in the greatest terror.  We were gratified to find that\nthe wound was not so severe as was to have been apprehended, the ball\nhaving passed through the fleshy part of his hand, between the thumb\nand forefinger, without breaking any bones, and probably without\ninflicting upon him a serious injury.  When his wound was dressed,\nand he received a few presents of old iron, &c., to him invaluable,\nhe left us, and jumped from one canoe to another, with the activity\nof a monkey, holding up his treasure, and talking with great\nvehemence, apparently delighted with his good fortune.  The natives\nhad nothing to exchange with us but a few mats, some of which were\nfinely wrought, cocoa-nuts, bone and shell ornaments, and\nfishing-hooks, for which we gave them, in return, pieces of iron\nhoops, or old nails.  We witnessed several instances of dishonesty\namongst them, as well as their entire want of confidence in us.\nWhenever one of them presented any thing for exchange, he held it\nfirmly grasped in his hand, until he received his pay with the other;\nand if he first obtained the old nail or iron hoop, without the\nperson, with whom he was trading, getting firmly hold of his mat or\nwhatever it might be, he was sure to keep both.  Every man carried a\nlong spear, and some of them a short weapon, slightly curved like a\nsword.  Their spears were from eight to twelve feet long, some of\nwhich had one and some two branches near the end.  They were pointed\nwith the hard bone of a large fish, and, from one to two feet from\nthe point, covered with rows of shark's teeth, that were immoveably\nfixed by a neat moulding of twine passing through the teeth, and\nround the spear.  The short weapons were armed in the same manner all\nover, except a small part left for the grasp of the hand.  Both were\nformidable weapons, and capable of inflicting a mortal wound.  A few\nof them wore dry wreaths of cocoa-nut leaves round their brows, which\nwere the only kind of covering we saw any of them have about their\nheads, and as the instances were rare, we thought it probable that\nthey were chiefs.  The dress for their loins consisted of two pieces,\none of which was composed of a few plaited leaves, next to the skin,\nand the other consisted of a mat, from two to three feet wide, and\nfour long, beautifully fringed at the bottom, and which served, not\nonly as a pretty ornament, but was useful as a protection against the\nflies, which almost everywhere amongst these islands are very\ntroublesome.  They were strong and robust looking men, of a very dark\ncopper colour, and most of them, particularly the old men, covered\nwith scars, that they gave us to understand were occasioned by wounds\nfrom their spears and daggers.  They wore their hair long, and in\ndisagreeable looking matted locks.  None of them had heavy beards,\nand in general but little.  It is not improbable that they pull them\nout with fish-scales, as is practised at the Marquesas, and many\nothers of the South Sea Islands.  This is done by compressing the\nbeard with the fingers between two large fish-scales, in the manner\nof applying a pair of tweezers.  A great many natives, most of them\nwomen and children, had assembled on the shore, opposite to us, where\nthey remained all day, singing and amusing themselves.  No females\ncame off in the canoes.\n\nWe saw no water, except a small quantity that one or two of the\nnatives had in cocoa-nut shells, and, much to our regret, from\nignorance of their language, could not inquire where it was to be\nobtained.  The land no where rose more than from three to seven feet\nabove the level of the sea, and as we could not land with safety, we\nhad no means of ascertaining whether any rivulets existed upon it.\nThe island seemed to produce nothing, but cocoa-nuts, which must be\nthe only food of the natives, except when they are so fortunate as to\ncatch fish.  Towards evening we stood out of the bay, and hove to off\nthe south-west point, where we sent a party on shore to collect a\nquantity of cocoa-nuts, of which there was a dense forest, that\npromised an abundant supply.  Our people were no sooner on shore than\nthey saw the natives approaching them in different directions, armed\nwith spears and paddles, making signals to each other, and signs, for\nthe intruders to depart.  Every tree had some peculiar mark, from\nwhence we concluded, it was considered the property of some\nindividual.  It was after sun-down, and night was closing in fast\nupon our party, who finding, from the determined manner of the\nnatives, that, whatever they took, must be by violence, gave up the\nenterprise, and returned to the beach.  It was fortunate that they\ndid so, for the tide had risen considerably, and with it the surf had\nincreased in a dangerous degree.  All, however, got off safe, but\nwith wet jackets, and at eight, P.M., October the 30th, we hoisted in\nthe boat, and made sail.\n\nWe ran off with a fine breeze, and at half-past three, A.M., made the\nDuke of York's Island, directly ahead, and sooner than we expected.\nIt was not more than three or four miles off; the deep hollow roar of\nthe surf could be distinctly heard, and its foaming white crest seen\nthrough the mists of the night, as it tumbled on the shore.  We hove\nto until morning, when we made sail along the land, towards the south\nend of the island.  This island is noted on the chart, as\nuninhabited, when discovered by Commodore Byron, in 1791; and it may\nbe supposed, that we were not a little surprised, on approaching the\nsouthern point, to see two canoes putting off for us.  One of them\ncame alongside, the other kept at a distance.  The first had but one\nman in it, who exchanged a mat for a piece of iron hoop, and returned\nimmediately to the shore, followed by his consort.  When we got to\nthe southward of the point, which was the lee side of the island, we\nhove to, and sent a boat to look for anchorage.  The shores were\nsimilar to those of Caroline and Clarence Islands,--of coral, and\nshelving suddenly into deep sea-water.  It was somewhat better here,\nhowever, for within half a cable's length of the surf, we let go our\nanchor in twenty fathoms water.  Although we veered eighty fathoms of\ncable, the bottom was so smooth, and its angle of depression so\ngreat, that we drifted off.\n\nWe stood in again, and running the vessel close in with the edge of\nthe surf (the wind blowing off shore) came to in eight fathoms.  In a\nfew minutes, a native made his appearance on the coral bank, near us,\nwith his arms full of cocoa-nuts, which he held up, as if for our\nacceptance, waving at the same time a green branch, and frequently\njumping about upon the rocks, in a childish, playful manner.  A boat\nwas sent to bring him off; but when he saw her approaching pretty\nnear, he threw the nuts in the water towards her, and hastily\nretired.  A coral bed, like that at Caroline Island, extended off\nfifty or a hundred yards from the shore, which, like that, was\nperforated every where with holes, and resembled, in its frail\nappearance, ice that has been for a long time exposed to rain.  The\ntide was low, and the surf breaking but lightly upon it, we were\nenabled to land without difficulty.  At our approach the natives all\nran off, and for a considerable time could not be prevailed upon to\ncome near us.  After a while their timidity relaxed, and they came\nround us, one by one, until we had a dozen of them assembled.  Still\nthey were very much afraid, starting with every motion we made, and\nif we attempted to touch them, they ran from us, and became as shy as\never.  From our place of landing, we could discover that this island\nwas similar to the Duke of Clarence, being a narrow chain of little\nislets and reefs, of coral formation, covered with bushes and\ncocoa-nut trees, and comprehending within the chain a lake of many\nmiles in circumference.\n\nAt our place of landing, the island between the ocean and inland sea,\nwas not more than two hundred yards wide, and this appeared to be as\nwide as any part of the chain that came under our immediate\nobservation.  In passing over to the borders of the lake, we saw near\nthe centre of it a large raft, and a number of canoes filled with\npeople.  On first landing, we were surprised not to see any women or\nchildren, the mystery of which was now explained, as well as the\nsingular visit we received on first approaching this part of the\nisland.  The person in the canoe had been sent off as a spy, to\nreconnoitre us, and from the report he made, it was thought expedient\nto remove the women and children, where we now saw them at a place of\nsafety.  They did not appear to be more than thirty in number, and\nthe men on the island did not exceed fifteen.  The men resembled the\ninhabitants of Clarence Island, in dress, colour, and every thing,\nexcept that they had a sickly look, and, in strength and activity,\nseemed much their inferiors.  Their canoes were also the same.  Like\nthe inhabitants of the Duke of Clarence Island, they had nothing\namongst them that indicated a visit of white men before.  The\ncocoa-nut, except when they catch fish, is their only food.  No\nbread-fruit trees were seen growing upon either island.  They\nexchanged for iron hoop and old nails, their rude shell ornaments,\nmats, cocoa-nuts, and fishing nets.  We witnessed several instances\nof dishonesty, practised by them upon us, and each other.  Their\nfishing-nets, which were beautifully wrought, they had concealed,\nfrom the apprehension that we would plunder them; but when they had\nmade acquaintance with us, and found that our disposition towards\nthem was friendly, persons, to whom the nets did not belong, would\npurloin, and bring them to us, in exchange for pieces of iron hoop.\nNot long afterwards the owner would discover his net in the\npossession of one of our people, and claim it as his property, or\ndemand a gratuity.  In this way, they made us pay in some instances\nthree or four times for the same thing, frequently (we began to\nsuspect) pretending a fraud had been committed upon them, whilst they\nthemselves were the rogues.  We saw no animals or birds upon the\nisland, but presented them with a pair of pigs, male and female, with\nwhich they were very much pleased, and before we left them, so far\nacquired their confidence, that they came amongst us without fear,\nand, in many instances, became troublesome by their familiarity.  The\nonly water we saw on the island was in a few trunks of cocoa-nut\ntrees, the stumps of which had been hollowed out, and from whence we\nsupposed that, in time of drought, if not always, they are supplied\nwith this important necessary of life.  We regretted the more that we\ncould not find a sufficient supply here, as the thinly populated\nstate of the island would admit of sending our parties on shore,\nwithout the least apprehension of hostility from the natives, and\nbecause the landing was such, as to permit the embarkation, without\ngreat labour, or risk of losing boats.\n\nAs the Duke of York Island was not inhabited, when discovered by\nCommodore Byron, thirty-five years previous to the visit of the\nDolphin, it is reasonable to suppose, from the strong resemblance of\nthe natives to those of Clarence Island, their dress and canoes being\nthe same, that they came from thence at no very distant period.  The\ndistance of these islands from each other, is only about forty miles,\nand a canoe, being driven from one in the direction of the other, in\ntempestuous weather, would soon be in sight of it.  Towards evening\nin returning on board, we found, to our regret, that the tide had\nrisen two or three feet over the coral bank, and it became difficult\nfor us to see the holes, some of which, being now filled with water,\nwere deep enough to be attended with danger.  Besides this, the surf,\nas is usual upon these coral banks, had increased with the rising\ntide to such a degree, that we found it difficult to embark.  Guided\nby our observation, in the morning, however, we got on board safely,\nwith the exception of some trifling accidents.  The most serious of\nwhich was having the boat bilged against the rocks.\n\nAt four, P.M. on the 31st of October, we got under way, and steered\nto the westward.  For several days the weather was squally, and the\nwind variable, shifting suddenly to all points of the compass, and\nblowing at times with great violence.  We experienced strong currents\nsetting in different directions, which were now a cause of serious\nalarm to us, as we should soon be surrounded by reefs and chains of\nislands, all low, and to be seen only for a few miles on a clear day.\nOn the 9th of November, Byron's Island was seen, at 8 P.M. six miles\nfrom us, and soon afterwards the shore was lighted up with a number\nof fires.  The surf was beating heavily upon the weather-shore.  We\nstood off and on until morning, when, having been driven to leeward\nby a strong current, we beat up for the island, passing several\ncanoes on our way, and having a great many others in different\ndirections to windward, running down for us.  At meridian, we were\nclose in with the land, where we beat about for several hours,\nlooking for anchorage.  Once we tacked, in three fathoms, so close to\nthe coral bank, where was beating a heavy surf, that we could almost\nhave jumped upon it.  At 6, P.M. on the tenth, we anchored in ten\nfathoms, within less than a cable's length of the surf, and where the\nwater was so clear, that we could see almost every coral rock at the\nbottom.  Besides the rocks, it presented the appearance of a splendid\nlandscape of trees and copse-wood, ornamented with the most lively\nand brilliant colours, which, affected by the swelling of the ocean,\nwere transformed into a representation of a rich and beautiful\ncountry of mountain and valley.\n\nWhilst we were beating about, canoes were assembling near us, in\ngreat numbers, and as soon as we anchored, came along side, the\npeople jumping on board without the least hesitation, talking and\nhallooing to each other so loud, as almost to deafen us with their\nnoise.  They had not been long on board, before several of them were\ndetected in thieving, and when threatened, seemed quite regardless of\nour displeasure, although it was expressed in a way calculated to\nmake them sensible of its disagreeable consequences.  They were all\nprovided with long shark's-tooth spears, and walked about the deck\nwith a swaggering, independent air, that seemed to challenge, at\nleast, an equality.  But few brought any thing else with them but\ntheir spears, which they would not dispose of, and altogether, their\nnumber and appearance was truly formidable.  At sunset, we sent them\noff, and they all returned to their respective islets.\n\nThe appearance of Byron's Island, differed scarcely in any respect\nfrom that of the Duke of Clarence.  Its dimensions and formation were\nperfectly similar; and, like the latter, it was inhabited by an\nenterprising and warlike people, whose dress, arms, canoes, and\nmanner of life, seemed to be identically the same.  The islet abreast\nof us was all night illuminated with numerous fires, and the air rung\nincessantly with the shouts of hundreds of people.\n\nWhen the day dawned, the whole ocean was whitened with the little\nsails of canoes that were seen coming from every direction, and some\nof them as far as the eye could distinguish so small an object.  In\nan hour, not less than a hundred of them were alongside, and our deck\nwas crowded with the natives.  The officer of the watch undertook to\nwash off the deck, which he found altogether impracticable: not a\nword could be understood for the noise that they made, and when they\nwere pushed out of the way by our people, they became insolent and\nresentful.  We were at length, obliged to resort to some little\nviolence to clear the decks of the unruly rabble, whose disposition\nto thievery and violence, became every moment more difficult to\nrepress.\n\nAn old athletic chief, whom our captain had treated with more than\nordinary attention, suddenly put his arms round him, and embraced him\nwith such herculean strength, that he was constrained to call on the\nmen near him for assistance; in a moment, they had a rope around the\nold chief's neck, and broke his grasp, and the captain having enough\nof Indian courtesy, was well pleased to dismiss them.  They still\nremained near us, and as many as were allowed, came alongside.  They\nexchanged for pieces of old iron, coarse matting, flying-fish, shell\nornaments, and a few of them disposed of their spears.\n\nOne fellow, who evinced an obstinate determination to come alongside,\nwas ordered off by the sentinel, who pointed his musket at him.  As\nsoon as the musket was pointed, he raised his spear, and stood in the\nattitude of throwing it until the sentinel came to a shoulder, when\nhe again took to his paddle; the musket was again presented, and the\nIndian, with the same promptitude, raised his spear, until the\nsentinel, feeling the awkwardness of his situation, reported the\ncircumstance to an officer.  I went forward, and pointing at the\nnative a pistol loaded with very fine shot, motioned for him to\nretire; upon which, he raised his spear at me, and I discharged the\npistol at his legs, when he dropped his arms and fled with the\ngreatest precipitation; I afterwards remarked him outside of all the\nrest of the canoes, apparently afraid to come nearer the vessel.\nAfter this example, none of them seemed disposed to question the\nauthority of a sentinel.\n\nThe islands we had seen, since our departure from the Marquesas,\nresembling each other so much, and none of them affording indications\nof water sufficient for our purposes, we began to think seriously,\nthat we might experience great inconvenience, and perhaps suffering,\nbefore we could procure a supply; we determined, therefore, to let no\nopportunity escape us, of examining every island that came in our\nway, if it could be done without too much risk.  With a view to this\nobject, the captain pulled in shore, followed by nearly all the\ncanoes; but when he arrived at the edge of the surf, which was so\nheavy as to make the landing difficult, he remarked that the people\non shore, of whom a great many were assembled, had all armed\nthemselves with spears and stones.  This hostile appearance, together\nwith the violence of the surf, made him hesitate about proceeding\nfurther, although the natives, on shore as well as those in canoes,\npressed him to land.  When, finally, he relinquished his object, and\nwas about to return on board, the people on shore dashed into the\nwater and swam off, and uniting with those in the canoes, made a\nviolent attempt to drag the boat into the surf.  The men promptly\nrepelled them, when they dived to the bottom, and coming up, showered\na volley of stones into the boat, which wounded a few of the crew\nslightly, and broke several pieces of the gunwale.  In the midst of\nthe excitement and confusion that prevailed, a native seized a\npistol, which he struggled violently to carry off, until a musket was\nfired, and he was taken into the nearest canoe severely wounded; it\nhad the effect to disperse the natives, who fled from the boat in\nevery direction, as she returned to the schooner.  When she was\nhoisted in, they came alongside, and some of them got on board.  We\ncommenced getting underway, and one of the anchors was already up;\nthe other having hooked to a coral rock, the captain directed the\nsentinel forward, to give the musket to him, and repair to his\nstation.  A native, who had been talking to the captain, embracing a\nfavourable opportunity, seized the musket, upon which was a fixed\nbayonet, and jumping overboard with it, swam towards the shore,\nkeeping half the time under water.  Muskets were fired at him, but he\nbore his booty safely through the surf to the coral bank, where,\nalthough he was still within striking distance, he marched away with\nthe most perfect composure, until he disappeared in the bushes.\n\nAfter this bold theft, several boats were prepared to land in search\nof water, and, if possible, recover the stolen property.  The captain\ntook the lead, and landed on the coral bank, with his arms and\nammunition wet and useless, whilst the boat, in returning through the\nsurf, was thrown upon the rocks, bilged, and before she finally got\noff, almost every timber in her broke.  This fatality having attended\nhis landing, he forbade the other boats to attempt it, choosing\nrather to remain in his defenceless situation, surrounded by hostile\nnatives, to the more serious consequence of losing the remainder of\nhis boats.\n\nBy signals concerted previous to his departure from the vessel, he\ndirected a fire at intervals from our cannon, in the direction of a\nlarge hut that we supposed belonged to the chief.  A small group of\nnatives approached him, one of whom, a man advanced in years, came up\nwith a green branch in his hand; the captain demanded of him by signs\nthe return of the musket, in reply to which, he addressed some one\nnear him, who ran off, and in about an hour, brought it without\neither lock or bayonet; these were also required, and our demand\nrepeated occasionally by a discharge of cannon in the direction of\nthe chiefs hut.  It was not long before the lock was brought, but no\nthreats could compel them to relinquish the bayonet.  The situation\nof the captain and his party was becoming more and more critical with\nevery moment's delay.  They were on a bank of coral a hundred yards\nwide, and small parties of natives, of whom great numbers were\nassembled in the bushes, would frequently sally out and throw stones\nat them.  They had no other means of protection or defence than what\nwas afforded by our guns, which were fired whenever the hostile\nparties made their appearance.  The hustle of our shot over their\nheads, and the fall of cocoa-nut trees, proved to them the\nsuperiority of our arms over theirs, and in a measure, had the\ndesired effect of keeping them back.  One circumstance, however,\nconvinced us that they were not yet fully sensible of this\nsuperiority, or if so, that they were intrepid to a degree that might\nwell alarm us for the safety of our people.\n\nWhen one of their parties had sallied out, there were two men walking\nalong the beach, carrying a canoe; a shot that was fired to drive the\nsallying party back, struck so near these men, that it threw the sand\nand gravel all over them.  They laid the canoe down and looked round\nthem for a few moments, when they took it up again and walked along,\nas they would have done under the most ordinary circumstances.\n\nWhen the captain became impatient of his confined situation on the\nbeach, besieged and harrassed as he constantly was by the natives, he\nmade bold to risk an excursion back upon the island, to show the\nnatives his disregard for them, and, at the same time, satisfy\nhimself as to the existence of water.  They did not any where oppose\nhim or appear in numbers; a few persons were seen behind the trees,\nor stealing along through the thickets without any demonstration of\nhostility.  His discoveries were few and unimportant; the only place\nwhere he found water, was in an old well, where it was stagnant and\nunfit for use.  In the huts that he entered, were stores of dry\ncocoa-nuts, and a preparation of dried fish and sea-moss.\n\nWe were filled with solicitude for our party when beyond the reach of\nour assistance, knowing that they had no other means of safety than\nthe opinion which might exist among the natives of their\ninvincibility, and we were highly gratified, after an hour's\nwatching, to see them returning to their old place of blockade--the\ncoral bank.\n\nIt was now sundown, and the surf had increased so much that we did\nnot believe it possible for a boat to reach the shore and return in\nsafety; and to send men there without a prospect of their being\nenabled to return, would be but a useless sacrifice of lives; but\nhere was our people on shore; the natives had followed them on their\nreturn to the beach; and their remaining after dark would probably be\nattended with the most serious consequences.  Two men, who were good\nswimmers, came forward and volunteered their services to take on\nshore a light boat that we had, and although I might have felt\nunwilling to exercise authority in the performance of so hazardous a\nservice, I was happy to accept the generous offer.  They landed in\nsafety, and the boat being deeply laden with the captain and his\nparty, they clung with one hand to her quarter, swimming with the\nother, until after a severe and most doubtful struggle, she emerged\nfrom the surf, almost filled with water, and was soon afterwards\nalongside.  It was thought that if there had been one more breaker to\npass, all would have perished.\n\nThe men of Byron's Island are stout, active, and well made.  They\nwere all naked, and covered with scars.  Some of them wore\nskull-caps, of grass, and wreaths of dry cocoa-nuts.  Their ornaments\nwere rude, and worn by but very few.  They consisted of shells and\nbeads, made of something that resembled whalebone, worn in long\nstrings,--by some round the waist, and by others round the neck.\nTheir hair was long and matted, and their complexion very dark.\nTheir beard was thin, and curled upon the chin, like that of the\nnegroes.  A few women came round us in canoes, who looked coarse, and\nalmost as robust as the men.  They wore round their loins a small mat\nabout a foot wide, with a fringe at the bottom.  But few of the men\nwere tattooed, and they very slightly.  Their canoes were ingeniously\nwrought, of a great many pieces of light wood, which were laced\ntogether by twine, made from the husk of the cocoa-nut; but they were\nso leaky as to keep one man baling constantly.  They were very\nnarrow, sharp at both ends, and had a small platform of light wood,\non one side, to keep them upright.  They resembled the canoes of the\nDuke of York and Clarence islands, but were rather narrower, and made\nwith better workmanship.  The canoe sails, of all these islands, are\nmats of straw or grass.\n\nAs soon as the captain returned on board, we got underway, and bade\nadieu to Byron's Island, and its inhabitants, whose acquaintance had\nbeen productive of nothing but anxiety and perplexity.  We run off W.\nby S., and in three or four hours made Drummond's Island, ahead,\ndistant three or four leagues.\n\nAt daylight, we passed a reef of considerable extent upon the N.E.\nend of the island, and ran down upon the west side of it.  When we\nhad approached the shore, within the distance of a league, canoes\nmade their appearance in every direction, sailing off to us.  We\nstood in, and found anchorage within two cables' length of the bank\nof coral, that stretched one or two miles from the shore, and which,\nat low water, was almost every where dry.  Here we hove to, having in\nsight, along the shore, twenty or thirty large villages, besides\nother habitations, that were thickly interspersed amongst the trees\nbeyond it.  The island, indeed, was swarming with inhabitants, and,\nfrom its extent and forest of cocoa-nut trees, seemed well adapted to\nsustain a large population.  It was low, and being quite level,\npromised but a poor prospect of affording a supply of water.  We had\nnot been long hove to, before we were surrounded by from one to two\nhundred canoes, having in each of them, with few exceptions, two men\nand a woman, the latter of whom was kept constantly employed baling\nthe water out.  They betrayed a greater degree of timidity than the\nnatives of any island we had seen before, keeping in their canoes, at\na distance from us, or approaching, with caution and distrust.  At\nlength some of them got on board, and others hung upon the sides of\nthe vessel, talking and exchanging their cocoa-nuts, and flying-fish,\nfor old nails, or pieces of tin.  One of them, an interesting looking\nyouth, was noticed by one of the seamen, who made him several\npresents, and in other respects, treated him very kindly.  The youth\nappeared to be sensible of the favour shown him, and expressed his\ngratitude by smiles, and by repeatedly patting the sailor on the\nshoulder; but, after this dumb show had been going on for some time,\nand when his patron's face was turned from him, he snatched his hat\nfrom his head, and jumped overboard with it, making his way as\nexpeditiously as possible to the nearest canoe.  The canoe took him\nin, and pulled off dead to windward of us, until they were out of our\nreach, although we threw several shot over their heads, to convince\nthem of the danger they encountered in such bold adventures.  From\nour first stopping place, we ran down a few miles, followed by all\nthe canoes, which were joined by many more.  Some of the natives\nagain came on board, and one man, to whom the captain had made\npresents, seized upon a fixture of the waist-boat, and abruptly took\nhis leave.  He was as suddenly saluted with a charge of bird-shot,\nfrom a pistol, but manfully clung to his prize, and bore it off in\ntriumph to his canoe.  Aided by his companion, he was playing us the\nsame trick, as the fellow who stole the sailor's hat.  But a few shot\nover their heads brought them to, when they lay down in the bottom of\nthe canoe, until we lowered a boat, and sent it to them.  When they\nsaw the boat approaching, they took to their paddles, and made an\neffort to escape; but, finding that impossible, jumped overboard, and\ncontinued diving from one side of the canoe to the other, until they\nwere taken.  They trembled excessively, expressing a great deal of\nalarm, upon being brought on board, and made several attempts to\nescape.  The captain inflicted upon the thief, a punishment, that he\nthought might be a useful admonition to the natives, in their future\nintercourse with white men, when, with his companion, he jumped\noverboard, apparently delighted, in having escaped so well.  The\nnumber and enterprising character of the people, changed our purpose\nof attempting to obtain a supply of water, by digging wells.  And,\nbesides the above objection, it was to be expected that, in the\nperformance of our duty, at the Mulgrave Islands, it would be\nnecessary for us to explore the whole group, where, within so great a\ncompass, our wants could scarcely fail to be supplied.  Accordingly,\nin the evening, we made sail, and, after clearing the island, hauled\nup to the northward and westward.  The inhabitants of Drummond's and\nByron's Islands, were, in all respects, similar to each other, even\nto their canoes and sails, the latter of which was a coarse matting\nof grass.\n\nDuring our passage from Drummond's Island to the Mulgraves, which was\nof nine days' duration we had squally weather, and were constantly\naffected by violent currents, for which, as they were irregular, no\nallowance could be made.  On the second day after our departure from\nDrummond's Island, our safety was considerably endangered from this\ncause.  Being near a chain of small islands belonging to the\nKingsmill Group, the weather thick and squally, we stretched off,\ncalculating that, at meridian, on the following day, we should be\nthirty miles to the northward of them; but, to our surprise, when at\nmeridian the weather cleared, and we got our observations, instead of\nbeing thirty miles to the northward, we were as much to the south,\nhaving been carried through them by a current at night.  We were two\nor three days in the vicinity of the Mulgraves', laying to at night,\nand drifting with the current nearly as much as we advanced through\nthe day, with light and baffling winds.\n\nOn the evening of November, the nineteenth, the welcome hail of\n\"Land! ho!\" was given, and shortly afterwards it was seen from the\ndeck, two leagues off.  It proved to be the easternmost of the\nMulgraves', for which we run down on the following morning, and\nanchored on the lee shore, within less than a cable's length of the\nsurf, in six fathoms water.\n\nThe island was low, of coral formation, and, in all respects,\nresembled Caroline, Clarence, York, Byron's, and Drummond's Islands.\nThe inhabitants were not numerous, and differed from all we had seen\nbefore in dress and manners.  They gave us a most kind and hospitable\nreception, freely offered whatever any of us expressed a wish for,\nand in all respects acquitted themselves in a manner highly\nsatisfactory.  Near our landing place we had the satisfaction to find\ntwo or three old wells of water, which, after being cleared out,\nwould afford us a supply without much labour in getting it off, the\nlanding being tolerably good.\n\nOn the twenty-first and twenty-second of November, we filled our\nwater-casks, and, with several parties, explored the island.  In our\nsearch we found a whaler's lance, and several pieces of old canvass;\nbut all our efforts to obtain a knowledge, from whence they came, or\nof the persons who brought them, were unavailing.  Some of the\nnatives came on board, all of whom were neatly ornamented.  They wore\nwreaths of flowers round their heads, bracelets and necklaces of\nbeautiful shells; a large roll of leaves, from one to two inches in\ndiameter, through slits in their ears, and as a covering for their\nloins, two bunches of a kind of grass, that resembled hemp, hanging\nbelow their knees, one bunch being behind, and the other before.\nNothing was stolen by them.  They behaved in a most orderly manner,\nlooking round the deck inquiringly, or seated themselves, and chatted\nfamiliarly with our people, taking pains to make themselves\nunderstood.  In their look and action they appeared to be lively and\nintelligent; but whenever the subject of our visit was pressed upon\nthem, by pointing to the whaler's lance, they became silent,\npretending to be ignorant of our meaning.  The activity of our\nexploring parties, in traversing all parts of the island, and our\nclose examination of every thing amongst them, that had belonged to\nthe whites, produced a sensible alarm by the third day; and, besides\nthe desertion of their habitations by some of them, a large canoe was\nmissing, that had departed from the island during the night.\n\nBeyond us, to the south and west, was a range of islets, as far as we\ncould see from the masthead, and having thoroughly explored the\nisland, where we were anchored, completed our watering, and made such\nrepairs upon the vessel as were necessary, we determined to proceed\nfurther in that direction.  At our anchorage here the wind several\ntimes changed from blowing off shore, which, as we had not room to\nride in shore of our anchor, made it, upon such occasions, necessary\nto get underway, and stand off.  At such times, we remarked, with\nparticular satisfaction, the advantage we possessed in our vessel,\nbeing schooner rigged, as none but a fore and after could, with the\nsame facility, have performed the delicate operation of getting\nunderway, and crawling off, when riding upon a lee shore, within a\nfew fathoms of the rocks, to have touched which would inevitably have\nbeen attended with shipwreck.\n\nUpon the island, besides cocoa-nut, there were a few bread-fruit\ntrees, growing in great luxuriance.  The golden yellow fruit, with\nwhich the females of Nooaheeva ornamented their necks, grew here in\nthe greatest abundance, and was eaten by the natives almost\nconstantly, who called it bup.  A species of small rat, with a tuft\nof hair upon the tail, was very numerous, and so tame, that hundreds\nof them were constantly feeding about the huts.\n\nThe first land we approached in proceeding to the southward and\nwestward, was a narrow islet, made up of dry reefs, and verdant\nspots, from one to two miles long, and two hundred yards wide.  On\nmost of the islets grew cocoa-nut, and bread-fruit trees,--the\ninvariable indication of inhabitants.  They were, however, but thinly\ninhabited.  Some of the reefs that connected them were covered with\nwater sufficiently for the passage of a boat.  The captain landed\nupon the eastern extremity, where he found a few people, most of whom\nfled at his approach, and such as remained, were so timid, that we\ncould hardly look upon them as the countrymen and near neighbours of\nthe natives, who had treated us with so much kindness at our\nanchorage.\n\nA small canoe came off, paddled by one man, who ventured on board,\nand looked round for a few minutes, when he departed, without seeming\nto have had any other object in view than to gratify his curiosity.\nWe should have suspected him of being a spy, had we not believed\nthese people too simple, to adopt such an expedient of civilization.\nThis we, however, afterwards ascertained was the capacity in which he\ncame, having been sent by the principal chief of all the Mulgrave\nGroup.\n\nThe schooner coasted along the islands, keeping way with the captain,\nwho continued on to the westward, examining all parts of it.  Beyond,\nin what we afterwards ascertained was an inland sea of great extent;\nseveral large sail canoes were discovered coming from a distant\nislet.  The captain crossed the reef into the inland sea, where he\nfound the water smooth, but every where filled with shoals of coral.\nWithout indicating a wish to examine the canoes, which might have\ncaused them to put back, he soon afterwards returned on board, and\nanother boat was sent to continue the examination of the islet, as we\nadvanced.  The officer prevailed upon some natives, that he met with,\nto come near him, and one of them gave him, in return for a present,\nsome glass beads.  Upon arriving at the western extremity of the\nislet, the captain put off for the shore, where he found four large\ncanoes hauled up on the beach, and those he had seen before, coming\nover the inland sea, just in the act of landing.  As we afterwards\nascertained, it was the high chief of the Mulgrave Group, with from\nfifty to a hundred of his chiefs and warriors, on a cruise of\nobservation, to satisfy himself who, and what we were, and what was\nthe object of our visit to his lonely and unfrequented isle.  None of\nthe chiefs had any thing to distinguish them, so that we knew not but\nthat they were here upon some ordinary pursuit, otherwise, their\npresence would have excited in us a much more lively interest.  As it\nwas, we were gratified to have an opportunity of seeing so many of\nthe natives, with their canoes, which we could examine, for proofs of\nthe crew of the Globe having landed upon these islands, of which we\nwere already pretty well satisfied from what we had seen.  The fact\nwas satisfactorily proved in a few minutes afterwards, by our\ndiscovering upon the platform of their canoes the lids of several\nsailors' chests.  On a farther examination, pieces of cloth and\nash-spars were also found.  The natives were watching our every look\nand motion, and notwithstanding their pretended apathy and\nindifference, could not conceal the intense excitement that our close\nexamination produced amongst them,  It soon gave rise to an animated\nconversation, which was accompanied with angry looks, and the only\nsatisfaction they gave us, when we pointed to the chest-lids, was a\nvacant stare, or a few words of their island language not more\nintelligible.  Not far from the beach was a pleasant grove of\ncocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees, through which was scattered a number\nof neat little Indian huts.  One of them, near the shore, was\nfrequented by a great many of the natives, with whom our people\nfreely mingled.  It was about ten feet high, and above the ground;\nhad a small garret, which was screened from observation by a floor of\nsticks, thickly interwoven with leaves.  Although most of the huts\nhad been examined by our men, it was our good or ill fortune, that\nthis, where so many were constantly assembled, should escape\nobservation.  We should there have found one of the men, as he\nafterwards informed us, for whom we were so anxiously looking; but\nthe discovery might have been attended with bloodshed, and, perhaps,\nfatal consequences to our shore party, than whom the natives were\nmuch more numerous.\n\nWilliam Lay, one of the Globe's crew, had been brought to this islet,\nby the chiefs, to be used as circumstances might suggest.  He was\nconcealed in the garret of the hut, and guarded by a number of old\nwomen, who were directed, the first whisper of noise that he made, to\nput him to death, the chiefs having also denounced their heaviest\nvengeance upon him, if he should, in any way, disclose the secret of\nhis being there.  He lay in this unhappy situation for several hours,\nlistening to the interchange of opinion amongst his countrymen, from\nwhose conversation he was informed of the character of our vessel,\nand the object of her cruise.\n\nTowards sun-down, when our parties were weary with the labour of the\nday, they repaired on board for the night, and the natives, getting\ninto their canoes, took their departure from the islet, and steered\naway, over the inland sea, until they were lost in the horizon.  We\nstood off and on during the night, and, at nine in the morning,\nanchored in nine fathoms water, near our place of landing.  Here\nthere was a channel into the inland sea, having nearly water enough\nfor the schooner, and through which we made an unsuccessful attempt\nto pass.  Our situation was now becoming very unpleasant.  It was\nnecessary for us to have parties on shore, exploring the islands, and\nthe remainder of the crew was quite insufficient to get the vessel\nunderway,--an expedient indispensable, whenever the wind came on\nshore, as the anchorage hardly ever extended more than half a cable's\nlength from it.  That we might lose nothing from delay or want of\nperseverance, however, soon after we came to, an officer, with a\nparty of eleven men, attended by a boat to take them over the drowned\nreefs, was sent to march round, and explore the islets, that formed a\ncontinued chain to the southward and westward of us.  We felt a\nconviction, from the conduct of the natives, that they were unwilling\nto give us the intelligence we required, and that we must depend\nentirely upon our industry and good fortune, for any discovery we\nmight make.  In the evening we sent a boat to communicate with our\nparty, but they had advanced so far, that she returned without seeing\nany of them.\n\nOn the following day, November the twenty-fifth, the weather clear\nand pleasant, a boat was sent with refreshments to our exploring\nparty, who were overtaken at the distance of ten miles from us, just\ncommencing their morning's march.  The islets, thus far, were narrow,\nnot averaging a quarter of a mile in breadth, and but thinly\ninhabited.  Our party were pleased with the conduct of the natives\nthey had seen.  They gave them cocoa-nuts, without receiving any\nthing in return, and in the evening, when they stopped to repose for\nthe night, provided them with huts to sleep in.  The officer of the\nparty, in the course of the day's march, found a mitten, with the\nname of Rowland Coffin marked on it, who, by referring to a list of\nthe Globe's crew, proved to be one of the boys left with the\nmutineers.  From the place where the party was found, the extent of\nthe island could not be seen.  I landed at the settlement where we\nwere anchored, and found the hats nearly all deserted.  Such of the\nnatives, as remained, seemed disposed to be very friendly, and\nfollowed me to the beach, where I shot a few sand-snipe, which drew\nfrom them loud shouts of applause, on witnessing the effect of my\nmusket.  Near the huts I observed a number of small white cranes, one\nof which I shot, supposing them to be wild, but afterwards regretted\nit very much, on learning that they were domesticated, and held in\ngreat reverence by the natives.\n\nAt five in the morning, November the twenty-sixth, a squall arose\nfrom the eastward, which struck the vessel adrift, in the direction\nof the trending of the land, and, dragging off the bank, we hove the\nanchor up, and stood along shore to the westward.  When we had run\nfifteen or twenty miles, we came up with our party, to whom we sent\nrefreshments, and proceeded on, passing several remarkable points.\n\nAt three, P.M., we came to, under a point, by which we were somewhat\nprotected from the sea, in ten fathoms of water, and about thirty\nfathoms from the coral rocks, where there was but three feet.  We\nwere considerably in advance of our party, whom we had now determined\nshould march round the whole circle of islets, if information of the\nmutineers should not sooner be obtained.  In front of us the islet\nwas wider than any we had seen elsewhere, and presented a noble\nforest of cocoa-nut, interspersed every where with the broad green\nleaves of the bread-fruit tree, which indicated a most luxuriant\ngrowth.  Huts were scattered about through the trees, and some close\nto the shore, forming a peaceful and romantic scene.  The landing was\ngood at low water, and practicable at high tide.  As far as we could\nsee to the westward, the land still continued.\n\nThe surgeon, who was very much debilitated, when we sailed from the\ncoast of Peru, had gradually, and almost imperceptibly, become more\nfeeble, and for some time past believed that he had a disease of the\nliver.  Until within two days of coming to our present anchorage, he\ndischarged his ordinary duties, in attending the sick, when his mind\nbegan to fail, and it was evident to us that the period of his\nexistence was near its close.  He lay for a time in a state of\ninsensibility, receiving the little aid that his friends could afford\nhim; and at forty-five minutes after four, P.M., November the\ntwenty-seventh, breathed his last, deeply lamented by all the crew,\nto whom he had greatly endeared himself, by kind and assiduous\nattentions, even when he was extremely ill, and knew that he was fast\nhastening to the close of life.  In the morning, I took a party of\nmen on shore, and in a grove, at the foot of a wide-spreading\nbread-fruit tree, made the narrow bed of our departed messmate.  At\nnine, the vessel struck adrift, and dragged off the bank.  When she\nagain stood in towards the shore, we landed, with as many of the\nofficers and men as could be spared to bury the doctor's remains,\nwith the honours of war.  The natives assembled, to the number of\ntwenty or thirty, and followed us to the grave, watching all our\nmotions with an expression of great surprise.  They were silent until\nthe first discharge of musketry, when they burst into loud shouts and\nlaughter, for which we drove them back, with threats of punishment, a\nconsiderable distance from us, where they afterwards remained quiet.\nAt the foot and head of the grave we planted seeds of orange, lemon,\nand cheramoya, and upon the bread-fruit tree, at the head of it,\ncarved his name, rank, and the vessel to which he belonged.  Below\nthis we spiked, firmly upon the tree, a brass plate, with his name,\nage, the vessel to which he belonged, and the day of his death\ninscribed upon it.  A little to the eastward of the grave we had the\nsatisfaction to find two springs of excellent water.\n\nOn the following morning our party arrived, and, after receiving\nrefreshment, continued on to the northward and westward.  They\ncrossed a long reef, that connected the islet abreast of us with\nanother, at the distance of a few miles, that had the appearance of a\nlarge settlement, from the immense cocoa-nut forests that rose in\nthat direction.  Soon after crossing the reef, and arriving at the\nextreme east end of the islet, where it was narrow and sandy, they\nsuddenly came to a place that was strewed with several hundreds of\nstaves of beef and pork barrels, and old pieces of canvass and cloth.\nIn advancing a little further, they found a skeleton, lightly covered\nwith sand, and a box, containing a few Spanish dollars.  The natives,\nsome of whom had been constantly following our party, and\noccasionally mingling with them, and administering, as well as they\ncould to their wants, upon approaching this place disappeared, or\nwere seen at a distance, skulking through the bushes.  These\ndiscoveries excited the liveliest expectation of soon making others\nmore satisfactory, and proceeding a mile further, they found an\nunoccupied hut, where, night approaching, they encamped.  Early in\nthe morning they took up their line of march, and had not gone far,\nwhen it was evident that the natives were preparing for hostilities.\nGroups of them were frequently seen at a distance, armed with spears\nand stones, and holding animated discussions.  They were much more\nnumerous than our party, who, upon examining their ammunition, found\nit was wet, and that the few arms they had, which were no other than\na pistol, for each man, were also wet, and unfit for immediate use.\nThe officer, therefore, determined to retreat to the place of his\nnight's encampment, until he could despatch information of his\nsituation, and ask for a reinforcement and ammunition.  On arriving\nwhere he had spent the night, he found that the hut he had occupied\nwas gone, and also that a large sail canoe, he left there, had been\ntaken away.  Not a single person was any where to be seen.  Here he\nremained, sending two of his party to the schooner, which was now\nseveral miles from him.  A little after meridian, we received them on\nboard, and heard, with great interest, the information they gave.\nThere was no doubt in our minds, that this was the place where the\nmutineers, and others of the Globe's crew, had been left,--but where\nare they now?--was a question, which naturally occurred to us.  We\nhad given the natives no cause, to excite them to hostility; but, on\nthe contrary, had taken every means that suggested itself, to gain\ntheir confidence and esteem.  If they wished to make war upon us,\nopportunities had been frequently presented, when our exploring party\nmight have been assailed by overpowering numbers, with a prospect of\nsuccess, of which they had not availed themselves, and here they were\nnow apparently wavering between peace and war, just at the moment of\nour discovering the place where our countrymen had been.  We knew not\nhow to account for this change in their conduct, but by supposing\nthat the mutineers were amongst them, and that, from our near\napproach, they were becoming alarmed for their safety, and had roused\nthe natives to war, with the hope of defending themselves by open\ncombat.  If this supposition were true, and it seemed very probable,\nthe situation of our party was very critical, and no time was to be\nlost in giving them the aid they asked for, and renewing our search\nwith redoubled activity.  The launch was hoisted out, and fitted with\nall possible expedition, and at four, P.M., November twenty-ninth,\nsailed with two officers and eleven men, together with the three\nbelonging to the party, being all that we were willing to spare from\nthe schooner, as a bold attempt upon her by a large party of the\nnatives, led on by an enterprising and desperate chief, might have\nplaced her and the lives of all her crew in the greatest jeopardy.  I\ncrossed the reef, which was sufficiently overflown by the high tide,\nto admit of it, and ran down in the inland sea to the encampment of\nour party, where I arrived at eight in the evening, and found them\nall safe; but looking for our appearance, with the greatest anxiety.\nI allowed the boat's crew to land, and get their supper in company\nwith those on shore, preparatory to commencing their night's work.\nWhen we were prepared for our departure, and had embarked, I was\ngreatly chagrined on examining the boat, to find that the shore\nparty, to whom I had brought fresh arms and ammunition, had, in their\nover-anxiety to be well supplied, deprived me of part of mine, and I\nwas under the necessity of landing, and searching, not only the men,\nbut even the bushes, before I found them.\n\nOur party had acquired no information since morning, but from the\ndiscoveries that had already been made, we felt satisfied, that on\nthe following day, we should find other traces of the mutineers.  In\ntaking my departure, I stretched off with a fine breeze, but it was\nblowing directly from the point to which I wished to steer.  I\nsuffered the men to lay down and refresh themselves with sleep,\nwhilst midshipman S. and myself steered the boat, and to my regret,\nin returning back towards the shore from whence I had started,\ndiscovered that we had lost ground; besides, our boat being clumsy\nand badly fitted, we found that we had to contend with a strong\ncurrent.  I got the oars out, therefore, and pulled dead to windward\nuntil day-light, when having proceeded about six miles, we again made\nsail to the northward and eastward, close haul upon a wind; it\ngradually veered, until I could head for an island eight or ten miles\nfrom us, which just appeared above the horizon, and where I designed\nto land and give the men breakfast.  When within two or three miles\nof the island, I observed a number of canoes leaving places nearer to\nme and landing upon it.  Two canoes had put off from thence, and were\nstanding for me as I was beating with my clumsy boat to weather an\nintervening coral reef; they were manned with about twenty natives,\nall armed with spears and stones.  When they had approached me pretty\nnear, and were passing under my lee, I ran alongside to examine them,\nfor which they gave us a great many cross looks.  As soon as I\nsuffered them to depart, they immediately returned to the shore from\nwhence they came, and where I not long afterwards discovered about\ntwenty canoes that would carry from twenty to forty men each.\n\nThe canoes I had boarded, sailed at least three miles to my one, and\nI now discovered the impossibility of possessing ourselves of the\nmutineers of the Globe, whilst they, or the natives, if friendly, to\nthem, had the disposal of such fleet vessels, with which to avoid us\nwhenever our too near approach endangered their safety.  I\ndetermined, therefore, to take possession of all that were now\nassembled, even though I should be opposed by the natives, and\nreduced to the necessity of measuring our strength with them.\n\nThe island was small, producing but few nut trees, and having but a\nsmall number of huts upon it, notwithstanding which, there were\nseveral hundreds of people assembled;--a great crowd, considering the\nthinly populated state of the islands.  But as this large assemblage\ncould only have been brought together from some extraordinary cause,\nI determined to land and search their huts, and look round, before I\nmade so wide a breach with them, as must necessarily result from the\nseizure of their canoes.  I was sorry to see, on our coming near\nthem, that they were sending their women and children towards the\nhuts, which were at a short distance from the assemblage of natives;\na movement that indicated a want of confidence in us on their part,\nor what was still less agreeable to us, a disposition to hostility.\n\nThere was some surf on the shore where we were about to land near the\ncanoes, and that the boat might be the more readily at our disposal\nwhen we should have occasion for her after landing, I dropped an\nanchor, and was in the act of veering to through the surf, when, to\nmy astonishment, a person dressed and looking like a native,\naddressed us in our own language.  He was standing upon the beach\nthirty or forty yards distant, and half way between us and the\nnatives, all of whom had seated themselves.  The first words that we\nunderstood, were, \"The Indians are going to kill you: don't come on\nshore unless you are prepared to fight.\"  The scene now presented to\nus, inspired an indescribable sensation; for, although we were\nconvinced that this was one of the men we were so anxiously looking\nfor, his sudden and unexpected appearance, his wild attire, and above\nall, his warning, seemed like an illusion of fancy.  His hair was\nlong, combed up, and tied in a knot on the top of his head; round his\nloins, he wore a large mat, finely wrought, and the use of cocoa-nut\noil, and the action of a tropical sun, for nearly two years, had made\nhis skin almost as dark as that of the natives.  He earnestly\nrepeated, several times, that we must not land unless we were\nprepared to fight, and described the plan the natives had concerted\nwith him, which was, to prevail upon us to come on shore and seat\nourselves amongst them, when, at a given signal, they would all rise\nand knock us on the head with stones.  This statement was probable\nenough, but the suspicion that this was one of the mutineers, very\nnaturally occurred to our minds, with the questions, \"Why have we not\nfound him before? and, why does he not now fly to us for protection,\nif he is innocent?\"--forgetting that our contemptible numbers\nprecluded all idea of safety to him, if opposed by the numerous\nassemblage of natives by whom he was surrounded.  I asked his name,\nwhich he told me was William Lay, and that he was one of the crew of\nthe Globe.  His stature and juvenile appearance, answered the\ndescription we had of him.  I told him to come to the boat, but he\nsaid that he was afraid of the natives, who had directed him not to\nadvance any nearer to us.  I then directed him to run to us and we\nwould protect him; but he declined, saying, that the natives would\nkill him with stones before he could get there.  During all this\ntime, they thought he was arranging their plan for us to come on\nshore, and called out frequently to him to know what we said; to\nwhich, he replied in a way calculated to suit his purpose.\n\nAfter discharging and re-loading our pistols, with one of which and a\ncartridge-box each man was provided, we landed, and marched up to the\nplace where Lay was standing.  Still doubting whether he were not\nmore foe than friend, and determined that, under any circumstances,\nhe should not escape, I received him with my left hand, presenting,\nat the same time, a cocked pistol to his breast.  I was not\ninsensible to the sentiment my harsh reception was calculated to\ninspire; but circumstanced as I was, I could not risk every thing in\npreference to inflicting a momentary pang, keenly as it might be\nfelt.  I repeated the question, \"Who are you?\" to which he replied,\n\"I am your man,\" and burst into tears.  I told him then to say to the\nnatives, that if they rose from their seats, or threw a stone, we\nwould shoot them all; but the poor fellow, delirious with joy for the\nmoment, knew not what he said, and, instead of obeying my command,\ncalled out in half English, and half Island language, in broken\nsentences, most of which was unintelligible to us; amongst other\nthings, he exclaimed, \"they are going to kill me, they are going to\nkill me.\"  I ordered him to be silent, and then asked, why he told\nthem we were going to kill him.--Recollecting himself immediately, he\nbegged my pardon, declaring that he knew not what he was saying.  By\nthis time, some of the natives had risen, and were becoming very\nanimated and violent in their conversation and gestures.  Two or\nthree of them advanced towards us; I pointed my pistol at them, and\nmade Lay repeat my threat, which had the desired effect on all but\none old man, who, unarmed, advanced in defiance of me.  Lay desired\nme to suffer him to approach, which he did, and taking hold of Lay's\nhand with both of his, he asked what his countrymen were going to do\nwith him.  Lay explained to him, in a few words, as clearly as he\ncould, at which the old man seemed much affected.  This was his\nbenefactor, the person to whom he was indebted for life; and the poor\nfellow seemed not wanting in sensibility or gratitude, at the moment\nof their parting.  He embraced him affectionately, told him that he\nwould see him again before he departed, and wept like a child.  I was\nunwilling to remain longer than was absolutely necessary, lest the\nnatives, when they had recovered from their first surprise, should\nconceive a contempt for our small number, and make trial of our\nstrength, in which I knew they would be much superior to us, if they\nwere determined and brave, as the first discharge of our pistols\nwould place us upon an equality with the same number as ourselves.  I\ntherefore cut short Lay's interview with his friend, and hastened him\nto the boat; there he wept for joy, and gave us several proofs of the\nagitated state of his mind.  His first impulse, which did great\ncredit to his heart, was, to inquire if his friends were well, and\nthen recollecting that it was probable none of us knew them, told us\nhe belonged to East Saybrook, Connecticut, and asked if any of us\nwere acquainted in that section of the country.  He several times\nrepeated the same questions, forgetful that he had asked them before,\nand that we had replied in the negative.  When his mind was a little\ncomposed, we made inquiries of him respecting the rest of the Globe's\ncrew, who had been left on the island; to which he answered, that\nthey were all dead except Cyrus H. Huzzy, who was on an island a few\nmiles to windward of us, and now full in sight.  He asked, with an\nexpression of great solicitude, if we would go for Huzzy, and when I\ntold him we would, it seemed to afford him not less pleasure than his\nown deliverance.  He stated that he and Huzzy both knew that we were\nin search of them, and that our vessel was a man of war.  He said\nthat the chiefs had sent spies on board of the schooner every day\nwhen it was practicable, who had communicated to them the number of\nguns we carried, and, within a very few, the number of which the crew\nconsisted.  They had apprised them of the force and conduct of our\nexploring party, descending to the minutest particulars, and even\ndescribing most of the individuals on board.  They had seriously\ndebated the question of making war upon us several times, and always\nconsulted Lay and Huzzy as to the propriety of it, and what would\nprobably be their prospect of success.  They dissuaded them from it,\nof course, and filled them with apprehension, by declaring,\nrepeatedly, that we were invincible, and that there was scarcely any\nthing we could not accomplish with our six-pounders; they even made\nthem believe, trifling as our armament was, that we could sink the\nislands with our cannon: so ready is the human mind to receive for\ntruth what it cannot comprehend, if recommended by superior\nintelligence, though it may be at variance with every thing in nature\nor reason.\n\nThe natives were told to let us go where we pleased, without\nmolesting us in any way, to give us whatever we asked for, and, at\nall times, to show themselves friendly to us.  They had strictly\npursued the course of conduct pointed out to them by the young white\nmen, in whose superior knowledge of us and our prowess, they placed\nevery reliance; but still they doubted the probability of\nconciliating our friendship in the sequel, and adhered tenaciously to\nthe idea of accomplishing our destruction in some way, to make their\nown security the more certain.  With this object, a variety of plans\nwere submitted at different times, to Lay and Huzzy, by those amongst\nthe chiefs esteemed the wisest and bravest, all of which were\ndiscouraged, and the success of such an undertaking in any way, as\nfrequently declared to be utterly hopeless.\n\nOne of their plans was, to get alongside of us at night, unobserved,\nand with some of the sharp instruments they had obtained from the\nGlobe, make a hole in the bottom of the vessel, and sink her; when,\nthey very truly believed, that those who were not drowned, would be\nan easy prey to them, and that the party on shore, unaided by the\nschooner, might soon be overcome and destroyed by their superior\nnumbers.\n\nAnother of their plans, and the most plausible one, was, to assemble\nsecretly all the canoes of the islands, at some point not distant\nfrom us, and approaching under cover of the night, surprise and board\nus.\n\nIf this last plan had been put into execution, in a dark night, it is\npossible that it might have succeeded, as we could hardly have seen\nthem in time to use our cannon, and the fire of musketry which they\nhad heard before, would probably not have driven them back when they\nhad advanced near to us, particularly if, as might be apprehended, at\nnight, the fire were not directed effectively.  They would not have\nfound us entirely unprepared; for, under the impression that the\nmutineers were still living, and on terms of friendship with the\nnatives, we were on the lookout for such an attempt being made, as it\nseemed to be the only means by which they could possibly escape, and\nthe plan which would most naturally occur to desperate men in their\nsituation.\n\nIn advancing towards the island where we expected to find Huzzy, Lay\ntold us that the island where we found him was a favourite place for\nfishing at a particular season, when numerous shoals of fish swam\nupon its shore.  Our schooner was anchored at the place of residence\nof the high chief, who, with those we found assembled upon the small\nisland, had fled there to avoid us.  The boat's crew being oppressed\nwith fatigue and hunger, I landed upon a dry reef, after proceeding a\nfew miles to give them rest and refreshment.  It was painful to\nwitness Lay's anxiety to depart, who, fearing a messenger might be\ndespatched to the chief who had Huzzy in custody, kept his eyes fixed\nupon us with an anxious, hurrying look, and several times expressed\nhis fears that the chiefs might have the boldness to attempt his\nrescue.  On finishing our frugal repast, we pulled up under an\nuninhabited point of Lugoma's Island, (this was the name of Huzzy's\nchief,) which, having passed without observation, an ample bay, upon\nthe shore of which was situated the village of the chief, opened to\nour view; and, to our great joy, the only sail canoe in his\npossession, was seen hauled up on the beach.  For a few moments, no\none was seen; but when we were in the act of landing, Lugoma and\nseveral old women came walking down to the beach, attracted by the\nstrange and unexpected appearance of our boat.  They were struck with\nthe utmost consternation at beholding Lay, who was still in his\nnative dress; and the old women began calling out, in a loud tone,\ndemanding of him what he was doing there, and what we wanted.  Before\nhe had time to reply to them, I got out of the boat, and taking, hold\nof Lugoma, and pointing a pistol at him, bade Lay say to him, that\nunless Huzzy was brought to me immediately, I would kill him.  He\nbegged that I would not hurt him, and said Huzzy was near and should\ncome to me.  The old women, alarmed for the safely of the chief,\ninstantly ran off, calling aloud for Huzzy.  It was but a few minutes\nbefore he appeared, walking towards us, with his fine yellow hair\nhanging in ringlets about his shoulders, and his person quite naked,\nwith the exception of a piece of blanket, tied round his loins.  When\nhe had approached sufficiently near, and I said to him, \"Well, young\nman, do you wish to return to your country?\" his eyes filled with\ntears as he replied, \"Yes, sir; I know of nothing that I have done\nfor which I should be afraid to go home.\"\n\nAs soon as Lugoma felt relieved from his apparently dangerous\nsituation, he began to express his solicitude for Huzzy, begging that\nI would not hurt him; and when he was assured that no injury was\nintended towards his son, as has called Huzzy, entreated me not to\ntake him away.  The old women united with the chief in the expression\nof their wishes, and seemed, by their loud talk and significant\ngestures, to insist upon the white man's remaining with them.  The\nscene was an interesting one, and we found a picturesque group\nassembled on a beautiful lawn, in front of a number of huts,\nsurrounded by cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees.  Huzzy owed his life\nto the native chief; he had been in the condition of a slave to him\nfor two years.  To him he was indebted for many acts of kindness,\nsome of which he had requited by his industry in his service, and\nsome had been cancelled by harsh treatment; yet, still he stood in a\ndelicate situation towards the chief.  The saving of his life alone,\nconferred an obligation upon him, which could scarcely be repaid by\nlong and faithful services.  The chief evidently appeared to regard\nhim as his son, and when the moment of our departure arrived, and he\nsaw we were determined to take our countryman with us, he joined\ntears to entreaties, saying he should weep long and bitterly for him.\nHe told Huzzy that he must come back again, and asked me if I would\nbring him.  As the only way in which I could get clear of so strange\na petition, urged with so much feeling, I promised to bring him back\nif his mother consented to his return.  With this, he appeared to be\ntolerably well satisfied, and we were about returning to the boat,\nwhen Lugoma took Huzzy aside to talk to him privately.  When their\ninterview was ended, I asked Huzzy what the chief had been saying to\nhim; to which he replied, that he had been reminding him how\ndifficult it would be for him to get along with his work without him,\nand that he must return as soon as he could, and bring with him some\naxes, guns, and cloths, such as his countrymen wore.  \"I have\npromised to bring them,\" said he, \"when I return, and he is quite\nsatisfied.\"  When we were ready to depart, to conciliate the good\nwill of the female part of Lugoma's family, I presented them with a\nvariety of trifles, such as finger-rings, glass beads, &c., for\nwhich, in return, they loaded me with a profusion of small mats, and\nrude shell ornaments, accompanied with many expressions of\nthankfulness and regard.  When I came to take leave of Lugoma, I\npresented him with a jack-knife.  With the exception of an axe, I\ncould have given him nothing more valuable, and it gained for me his\nunreserved confidence.  He immediately proposed going with me to the\nschooner, and got into the boat with his son, a lad eight years old.\nHuzzy took with him a musket and a Bible, the only things he had\nsaved at the massacre.  The first had been preserved for him by the\nchief, who thought that with this in Huzzy's hands, although he had\nno powder, he was a match for all his enemies; and the Bible he had\nclung to himself, and had kept as the companion of his lonely hours.\nThe Bible was more an object of curiosity to the natives than any\nthing else they found in the possession of the white men: they often\ninquired of Huzzy what it was, its use, &c., and his explanations\nseemed only to increase their superstition and aversion to it.  They\nwere never pleased to see him retire to the garret of his little hut,\nto read it, as was his custom; and invariably remonstrated with him\nagainst it.  They urged him frequently to destroy it, and when he\nrefused, they threatened to do it themselves.  As the reason of their\ndislike, they said it would bring spirits round the house that would\nkill or hurt some of the family.  Huzzy told them, that if they\ndestroyed it, the Great Spirit would come and kill them all; to which\nhe was probably indebted for its preservation.\n\nI was walking, back of the huts, over a level green spot, enclosed by\ncocoa-nut trees, when Lugoma came to me in great haste, and with a\ndisturbed look beckoned me to come away, at the same time saying to\nHuzzy, that I must not go there: it was a place for the dead; my\npresence would disturb them, and bring spirits round his huts; I\nindulged his superstition, and walked off.  Lugoma was about thirty\nyears of age, of moderate stature, square built, with low forehead,\nand flat nose; having an expression of countenance that indicated\nintelligence and enterprize.  Huzzy gave him the character of being\nvery passionate, inveterate in his enmities, fierce and determined in\nhis hostility, but firmly attached to his friends, and possessing a\nbenevolent heart.  He often became offended with Huzzy, in their\nordinary occupation, and upon such occasions would use violent\nlanguage, and sometimes threaten to kill him; but, when his passion\nsubsided, would be very sorry for what he had said, and soothe Huzzy\nby telling him not to be afraid; he would not hurt him.  Once,\nhowever, in working their canoe, when something went wrong, he raised\na paddle and struck Huzzy with it, upon which, the poor fellow, slave\nas he was, gave way to his indignant feelings, and was in the act of\nrepaying the chief's violence with interest, who, seeing that he had\ngone too far with the high-spirited white man, and that his life was\nmenaced, begged him not to strike, declaring that he would never\nagain raise his hand against him; and the quarrel was amicably\nsettled by Huzzy's telling him, that if ever he did, he would kill\nhim.  From this story, I thought there might be some truth in the one\nwhich Huzzy told me was one day related to him by Lugoma's son, the\nboy that was in the boat with us.  We had a mulatto lad on board of\nthe schooner, and at the time our contemplated capture was spoken of\namongst the natives, this little boy told Huzzy that his father was\ngoing to save the life of the mulatto boy, and then kill him as he\nwas getting too large.  The mulatto boy was a great favourite amongst\nthe natives, and upon several occasions, quarrels had arisen amongst\nthe chiefs who should have him, when in the presence of Lay or Huzzy\nthey were debating the question of our capture.\n\nThe day was far advanced when we left Lugoma's Island, and stood\nalong the shores of the islets to intercept the land party whom we\nmet at no very great distance, making rapid marches.  We landed to\ninform them of our success, and that their labour was at an end, in\nwhich they could not but rejoice with us, although they were\nextremely disappointed that they should not themselves have been the\nfortunate persons, after all the toil they had experienced in the\nsearch.  We put off and made sail in both our boats, and as the\ncanoes were all still upon the beach of the island from whence we had\ntaken Lay, I intended to land and get his musket, which, in the hurry\nof our departure, he had forgotten.  No sooner, however, did the\nnatives see both our boats standing towards them, than they put off\nwith all their canoes, and bore away directly before the wind.  We\nmade all sail in chase, but soon perceived that they were leaving us\nvery fast; and, as night was coming on, we made the experiment of a\nfew musket shots, fired over their heads, with the hope of bringing\nthem to.  Instead of answering the desired purpose, it served only to\nincrease their alarm, and the weather becoming squally, we suffered\nthem to depart without further pursuit.  I had cause to regret that I\nhad fired; for from the first discharge, poor Lugoma was in the\ngreatest agony, for fear we were going to kill him, as well as the\nrest of the chiefs.  All the explanations that Lay and Huzzy could\nmake, and all their assurances of my friendship, could not quiet him.\nSeveral times he would have taken his son and jumped overboard, had\nwe allowed him to do so.  Whenever I went to the stern of the boat\nwhere he was sitting, he repeated to me again and again that he was\nmy good friend, and that I must not kill him; my replying that I\nwould not hurt him, that I was his friend, &c., had not the least\neffect; it only caused him again to repeat what he had before told me\nof, his being my friend, and that I must not kill him.\n\nThe numerous shoals of coral, with the violence of the wind,\nrendering it somewhat dangerous to run in the dark, I determined to\ncome to for the night, as we were yet a long distance from the\nschooner.  For this purpose, we stood in towards the place where, on\nthe preceding night, we had met the exploring party.  Lugoma no\nsooner found himself so near the shore, than he became more earnest\nthan ever in his petition to be permitted to land with his son,\nalthough he was more than twenty miles from his home.  I would have\nallowed him to leave us, had I not been apprehensive of the hostility\nof his countrymen; I knew not but by his aid in piloting them to our\nnight's encampment, we might be surprised before morning, and my\nresolution to keep him was confirmed, when it was reported to me, by\nsome omen who had landed from the other boat, that one or more\nnatives had been seen near us, skulking through the bushes.  We also\ndetermined, not to trust ourselves on shore, but to lay in the boat,\nand make an awning of our sails, to screen us from the heavy showers\nthat were frequently coming over, in the best manner we could.--When\nwe had finished our repast, we hauled off and anchored, but not to\nsleep.  Our awning was but poorly calculated for shelter, and the\nshowers that constantly succeeded each other, kept us too wet and\ncold for rest; besides this, I was frequently reminded of Lugoma's\npresence, who made me pay dearly for his detention.  He would lay no\nwhere else than alongside of me, and during the whole night, not more\nthan ten minutes elapsed at any one time, that he did not move his\nhand over my face, and when he thought my attention was sufficiently\nawakened, call out to me, \"Hitera;\" a word that signified he was my\ngood friend, nor would he suffer me to rest a moment afterwards until\nI had replied to him \"Hitera.\"\n\nWe were anchored but a short distance from the place where the chief\nmutineer of the Globe and his murderous companions had landed--where\nhe had fallen by their hands, and where they, in their turn, had been\nkilled by savages.  It was a spot, calculated to revive, in the minds\nof Lay and Huzzy, the liveliest recollection of sorrows and\nsufferings, that no language could describe; and as we all wished to\nhear an account of the mutiny, and of the events that subsequently\ntranspired, I desired Lay to favour us with the relation.  Lay's\nnarrative was as follows: \"The first that I heard of discontent on\nboard of the ship, was a few days previous to the mutiny.  I went to\nthe maintop-mast-head, where I found Comstock; after a few moment's\nconversation, he said to me, 'What shall we do, William? we have bad\nusage: shall we take the ship, or run away?'  To this I did not make\nmuch of any answer.  I do not now remember what I said; I was quite\ninexperienced, it being my first voyage.  In the afternoon, or the\nnext morning, I heard him talking to some of the men on the\nforecastle about running away with him when we arrived at Funning's\nIsland, for which, I believe, we were then steering.  This, I\nsuppose, was for the purpose of sounding them, to find out their\ndisposition, and who would join him in the mutiny.--From what we\nheard, we began to think that all was not right, and tried to get the\nnews aft, but unfortunately did not succeed.  In the afternoon,\nbefore the night on which the mutiny took place, we were on the main\nyard furling the mainsail, and I tried then to tell the second mate,\nbut Paine or Comstock was between us, and I was afraid to say any\nthing.  Comstock had, some days previous, taken his cutlass from the\ncabin into the forecastle; he was a boat-steerer, and used to eat in\nthe cabin with the officers.  I knew nothing more about it until\ntwelve or one o'clock on the night that the mutiny took place; I was\nsleeping in the forecastle, when Rowland Coffin came and awoke me,\nsaying I must come upon deck, they had taken the ship.  I got up and\nwent aft, where all the crew were mustered on the quarter-deck.  When\nComstock had told us what he had done, and what his regulations were,\nhe said, that such as would not swear to stick by him, must go on the\nother side of the deck.  I did not know how many were engaged in the\nmutiny, and believing that we should be killed if we did not swear,\nwe all swore to stick by Comstock and obey his orders.  He then told\nus to haul the third mate up out of the cabin; I was one that had to\ntake hold of the rope made fast to him.  We laid him in the gangway,\nand I thought he was dead; but when Comstock was throwing him\noverboard, he clung to the ship with his hands.  Comstock told some\none to bring an axe and cut his hands off, when he let go and went\noverboard.  I saw him in the water astern, swimming after the ship\nfor some time.  We then made sail; Comstock was the only navigator on\nboard.  We first went to the Kingsmill Group, but did not like to\nstop there, as the natives were very numerous and thievish; besides,\nComstock had shot one of them for stealing something; after which, he\nwas afraid to stay amongst them.  From Drummond's Island, of the\nKingsmill Group, we came directly to the Mulgraves, and made this\npart of them, where we anchored and commenced landing the stores.\n\n\"The crew of the Globe consisted of between twenty-five and thirty;\nbut the only persons engaged in the mutiny were Comstock, Paine,\nOliver, and the black steward, (Lilliston, who was one of the\nmutineers he did not mention.)  It was midnight, and previous to\ndescending to the cabin, one of the number was placed as a sentinel\nat the cabin door, with an axe, Comstock saying to a young brother\nwho was at the helm, that if he did not keep the ship in her course,\nhe would kill him as soon as he came on deck.  Comstock killed the\ncaptain by striking him on the forehead with an axe whilst he was\nsleeping, having first locked the mates up in their state-rooms, that\nthey might not escape.  He then went with the other mutineers, and, I\nbelieve, cut the throats of the first and second mates, and shot the\nthird mate.  I did not see any but the third mate, and was told that\nthe others were thrown out of the cabin windows.\n\n\"Not many days after the mutiny, the black steward was detected in\nthe cabin loading a pistol which was forbidden on pain of death; and\non being asked by Comstock what he intended doing with it, he\nreplied, at first, \"Nothing;\" but, when questioned more closely, he\nsaid that he had heard Smith and some one else say, they intended to\ntake the ship.  Smith and the other person named by the steward, were\ncalled up by Comstock, and asked if they had threatened to take the\nship; to which they replied in the negative, insisting that they had\nnever intimated or intended any thing of the kind.  Comstock declared\nthat such an offence could not go unpunished, and that the steward\nmust be tried by a court martial; he thereupon told the steward to\nchoose one man, and said that he would choose another, and that the\ntwo should sentence the steward to such punishment as the offence\nmerited.  The two men were accordingly chosen, the steward selecting\nRowland Coffin for his advocate, and Comstock, Paine for his.  After\nhearing the evidence, and deliberating for a short time, they found\nthe steward guilty, and sentenced him to be hung at the yard-arm\nuntil he was dead.  Immediately afterwards, all hands were called to\nwitness the execution; and the steward was taken forward and given\nfourteen seconds to make his peace with God.[9] The foretop-mast\nsteering sail haulyards were overhauled down and tied round the\nsteward's neck, and Comstock, after making every body take hold of\nthe haulyards, held the fourteen second glass in one hand, and his\ncutlass in the other.  When the glass was out, he gave the signal for\nthe people to run away with the haulyards, by striking the ship's\nbell with his cutlass, and, in a moment, the criminal was run up to\nthe yard-arm.\n\n\"After the death of the officers, Comstock made us all live in the\ncabin with him, where the mutineers used to sing, and carouse, and\ntell over the story of the murder, and what they had dreamed.  Paine\nand Oliver, who could scarcely ever sleep, spoke with horror of their\ndreams, and of ghosts that appeared to them at night; but Comstock\nalways made light of it, and appeared to exult in what he had done.\nHe said once, that the captain came to him with his wounded and\nbloody head, and showed him what he had done, when he told the\ncaptain to depart and never come again, or he would kill him a second\ntime.\n\n\"After our arrival here, we made a raft of two whale-boats and some\nspars, and on the first or second day, landed thirty or forty barrels\nof beef and pork, sails, rigging, and a variety of other articles,\nwhen Comstock having pitched a tent on shore, commenced with the\nmechanics to work on a whale-boat that he was going to raise upon and\nmake larger.  Paine was displeased with his doing this so soon, and\nsent word to him that he had better discharge the ship, and then work\nupon the boats.  This greatly enraged Comstock, who hailed the ship\nfor a boat, and on her being sent to him, came on board.  There he\nand Paine had a violent quarrel, and Paine dared him to take a musket\nand go on shore with him and fight it out, which Comstock refused to\ndo.  When he landed, being afraid that Paine and Oliver would kill\nhim if he slept in the tent, he went off to pass the night with the\nnatives; in his absence, Paine and Oliver agreed to shoot him when he\ncame back; accordingly, on the following morning, he was seen coming\nalong the beach alone, \"and when he had arrived within good gun-shot,\nthey commenced firing at him; without changing his pace, he continued\nto advance, and drawing his cutlass, called out to Paine to stop\nfiring and he would make peace with him; Paine, however, continued to\nfire, and, at the third or fourth discharge, Comstock fell lifeless\nupon his face, a ball having pierced his heart.  Fearing that he\nmight not be quite dead, and perhaps would get up again, Paine ran up\nto him with an axe, and cut off the back of his neck.  He was buried\nclose to the tent, in the manner he had often expressed a wish to be,\nwith all his clothes on, and his cutlass hung to his side.  Upon\nfirst landing, he had fixed upon a site for a town, and amongst other\npublic buildings that he contemplated erecting, was a church, for\nwhich he had selected what he considered an eligible situation.\n\n\"The natives were all the time so very friendly, that we were not in\nthe least afraid of them.  A great many of them came to our tent\nevery day, and some of them were there day and night, eating,\ndrinking, and sleeping with us.  Paine had a girl that he brought\nfrom another islet, who did not like to stay with us, and would run\naway whenever she got an opportunity; he fired muskets at her several\ntimes, and at last, used to keep her by putting her in irons.\n\nA few days after the ship ran away, some of the natives, who had been\nat the tent, stole from us a number of tools.  Paine gave four or\nfive of our people muskets without cartridges, and sent them to the\nnatives, a great many of whom were assembled not far off, for the\nstolen articles.  The natives refused to give them up, and soon began\nto throw stones at our people, who, knowing that they had not the\nmeans of resisting, began to retreat; the natives pursued them,\nthrowing stones, and one of the party, Rowland Jones, either fell or\nwas knocked down by his pursuers, who came up immediately afterwards\nand killed him.  When the party returned to the tent, Paine, who had\ntaken the command after Comstock's death, ordered all the muskets\nbrought to him, and locked them up.  We were all in or about the\ntent, when a few hours afterwards the natives came there as usual,\nbut in greater numbers.  After they had been there a little while,\nsome one remarked, 'I am afraid they are going to kill us; they have\nall got spears, or stones, or sticks in their hands.'  Upon this,\nPaine said he believed we were all taken, but that he was safe.  The\nwords were scarcely out of his mouth, when the natives commenced the\nmassacre, knocking our people on the head with stones and clubs, and\nsticking spears in them.  An old man and his wife laid hold of me,\none on each side, and led me a little way off in the bushes, where, I\nthought they were going to kill me, but where they only held me fast\nand protected me from the violence of several who came and wanted to\nkill me.  I saw two of the natives lead Paine off a little way, and\nthought they were going to save his life; but they proceeded only a\nfew yards, when one of them took up a stone and struck him on the\nhead; he attempted to run, but a second blow brought him down, and\nthey immediately afterwards killed him.  Oliver, I did not see; but\nthe natives told me that he ran a short distance, when he was\novertaken and killed in the bushes.  A Sandwich Islander that was\nwith us, got to the water, and was overtaken and killed there.\"\n\n\"Were there any women at the massacre?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, and children too.  The women seemed to take as active a\npart as the men.  I saw one old woman run a spear in the back of one\nman, who was held by two natives, with a degree of violence that\nseemed far beyond her strength.  I thought that all but myself were\nkilled until the following evening.  I had been taken to the islet\nwhere your schooner is anchored, and where all the chiefs were\nassembled, when they brought Huzzy, to show me that there was one\nliving besides myself.  After an interview of a few hours, Huzzy was\ntaken away to live with Lugoma, who had saved his life, and I was\ntaken to live with the old man who had saved mine.  He was so very\npoor that I scarcely ever got enough to eat of the coarsest native\nfood.  I had to labour very hard, although I suffered constantly from\nhunger, which soon made me weak and extremely wretched.  At last, the\nhigh chief took compassion upon me, and made me live with him; after\nwhich, I had always plenty to eat, and was at liberty to work or not,\nas I pleased.  He was very kind to me in every respect.  They have\nalways brought Huzzy to me, or taken me to see him once a fortnight,\nor once a month, and suffered us to pass the day together.\"\n\nHere Lay's narrative ended.  Huzzy told us, that during his residence\nwith Lugoma, his time had been spent principally on the water, going\nwith him in his canoe, which required two to work it.  Lugoma was a\ngreat fisherman, and distinguished amongst the chiefs for his\nindustry and enterprising character.  He would always have enough to\neat, if he had to steal it.  When Huzzy would complain to him of the\nhard and laborious life that he led, Lugoma would always reply, that\nif he would eat he must work.  There seems to be no doubt, that the\nnatives saved the lives of these young men from no other motive than\nthat of making them slaves, and availing themselves of the advantage\nof their labour.\n\nAt the dawn of day, we prepared to depart for the schooner, and in\ngetting up our anchor, which was a kedge, weighing upwards of a\nhundred pounds, we found that it was hooked to a bunch of coral at\nthe bottom, from which all our efforts failed to move it.  As soon as\nLugoma saw our difficulty, he told his son to go down and clear the\nanchor.  The little fellow jumped into the water, which was about\nthree fathoms deep, and in a few moments came up, making motions for\nus to haul away.  He had disengaged the kedge, and we had no further\ntrouble in getting it up.  It is a universal practice amongst the\nnatives, whenever they wish to anchor, to take a line from the end of\nthe canoe, and tie it to a tree of coral at the bottom.\n\nThe chief persisted in his desire to leave us, saying he was still\nafraid I would kill him; and as I had no object in taking him with me\nagainst his will, I consented to his departure, presenting him with\nsome seeds, the culture of which I caused to be explained to him, as\nalso the value of the fruit.  Our return on board was welcomed by\nevery body.  We had now accomplished the object of our visit, and the\nislands were altogether so void of interest, except for their novel\nformation, and the singular habits of the natives, that we were well\ncontent to leave them and return to some other place more congenial\nto the feelings of civilized men.  Before we left, however, we wished\nto see the chiefs, and after representing the impropriety of their\nconduct toward the white men who had sought an asylum upon their\nislands, point out the course they must in future pursue towards such\nas might again visit them.  On the morning of December the first,\nnone of the chiefs or people residing upon the islet abreast of us\nhaving returned, the mother of the high chief was directed to send\nfor her son to come back, and bring with him the rest of the chiefs,\nwithout delay.  I made a visit to the chief's village, where I found\nbut few inhabitants, most of whom were women and children.  It was\nsituated on the side of the island opposite to us, and bordering upon\nthe inland sea.  It was not extensive, but a beautiful and romantic\nspot; the grove of cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees, through which\nwere scattered the huts of the natives, ran about a hundred yards\nback from the inland sea to a wild thicket that passes through the\ncentre of the islet, in length two or three hundred yards.  Here I\nfound the largest canoe that I had yet seen.  It was large enough to\ncarry fifty men, but being old, leaked so badly, that the high chief\nwas compelled to leave it behind, in his flight, with all the rest.\n\nNear the high chief's hut, we came to consecrated ground.  It was the\nplace of burial for the royal dead.  It was but a small space,\ncomprehended within the circumference of a few yards, and at the head\nof each grave stood a cocoa-nut tree, bound round with dry leaves,--a\nmark that prohibited the use of the fruit.  We were accompanied by a\nson of the high chief, a child about twelve years old, who desired us\nnot to tread on the graves of his ancestors.  Two graves were pointed\nout, as those of chiefs, who had been highly distinguished, beside\nwhich stood the aged trunks of cocoa-nut trees, that indicated the\nperiod of their demise to have been very distant.  At one of the huts\nwe saw a domestic fowl, which, when I expressed a wish to purchase,\nthe chief's son, whose name was Ladro, immediately presented me.  We\nafterwards saw a number of others running wild in the thickets.  They\nwere small, and looked like what is called the bantam.  The natives\nnever eat them, giving, as the reason for it, that they are not\ncleanly in their food.  On our return, Lay took me to a place, where,\nafter the massacre, he had buried a Spanish dollar.  It was still\nthere, and he took it with him as a memento of his captivity.  We\npassed several springs of water, to which the women are banished at a\ncertain period.\n\nWe met with a native, whom Lay knew, and who, assuming the native\ndress, went through the violent motions and gestures of a Mulgrave\nman, engaged in battle.  It was an indescribable mixture of the\nfrightful and ludicrous.  I was apprehensive that it would offend the\nnative: but he laughed with us at the representation, and said, it\nwas very good.  On the following morning, December the second, we\nwere disappointed in not seeing the chiefs.  The captain went again\nto the high chief's mother, who made some excuse for their not\nappearing, and declared, that they would positively be up that night\nby moonlight.  He told her to send to them again, and say, if they\nwere not there on the morrow, he would go after them, and the\nconsequence might be serious.  The old woman seemed very much alarmed\nat hearing such language, and promised a faithful compliance on the\npart of her son.  It had the desired effect, as on the following\nmorning, December the third, the chiefs all presented themselves on\nthe shore, near our anchorage.  The captain, taking Lay and Huzzy\nwith him, went on shore to meet them.  They told him, by way of\nopening the interview, that they were in his power, and ready to obey\nall his commands.  He required of them to restore a whale boat that\nbelonged to the Globe, a swivel, they had taken from the white men,\nand Lay's musket, to all of which they cheerfully assented.  He then\ngave them, as a proof of his friendship, some cotton handkerchiefs,\naxes, and a variety of other articles, of much more value to them\nthan those he had taken.  He told them, that white men would never\ncome there to hurt them, and that they must always be kind and\nfriendly to them, whenever ships should hereafter visit their island.\nThat, if other white men should ever be similarly situated to those\nthey had killed, they must take care of them, and at some future time\nthey would be rewarded for it.  They promised faithfully to do all\nthat they were told, and regretted having killed our countrymen.  We\ngave them a pair of pigs, male and female, which we told them to take\ngreat care of, and increase the number as much as possible,\nforbidding them, on pain of our displeasure, to kill any until we\nshould again return, which might be at no very distant period,\nalthough it was uncertain when.  The surgeon's grave was made a\nsacred spot by the high chief, and every thing about it was to be\nheld in the same reverence as the burial-place of his forefathers.\nThe high chief was instructed, through the interpreters, in the\nmanner of cultivating the fruits and vegetables, the seeds of which\nwe had given him in great variety.  Some we planted, and all was to\nbe under his especial care.  The use of the various kinds was\nexplained to him, as well as their importance to ships, that might\nvisit his islands, which would give him in return for them, axes, or\nwhatever else was most valuable to him.\n\nOn the fourth of December, I obtained a boat, and set off on a visit\nto Lugoma, who, contrary to his promise, had not yet been on board.\nI took Huzzy with me, knowing that it would delight the chief to see\nhim.  We met with a variety of obstacles in our passage, through the\ninland sea, and did not arrive at the islet of the chief until the\nsecond day after our departure.  We stood into his bay in the midst\nof a heavy shower, notwithstanding which, as soon as he saw us,\nhimself and son ran down to the shore to meet us, and waded up to the\nmiddle in the water, extending their arms towards us, full of roasted\nfish, of which he had taken a large quantity on the preceding day.\nBoth of them called to Huzzy, with repeated expressions of their\nhappiness at seeing him, and, in a moment after we struck the shore,\nthe whole tribe of old women welcomed us, with their joyful\nexclamations.  As soon as we were out of the boat, each one in turn\nclung round Huzzy's neck, and embraced him in the kindest manner.  In\nseveral different huts were large piles of fish, amounting to some\nthousands, which had been roasted to preserve them.  Lugoma offered\nat once to accommodate us for the night, saying, he had an abundance\nof room in his huts for us to sleep, and plenty of fish for us to\neat.  The weather was squally and wet, which induced me to accept his\noffer.  I wished, also, to witness the manner in which he caught fish\nin such quantities, and another opportunity might not offer before I\nleft the islands.\n\nAs soon as the shower was over, which lasted for two or three hours,\nLugoma went out, and employed himself busily collecting and breaking\nup dry wood, and arranging his ovens of stones, that all might be in\nreadiness to cook the fish as soon they were taken out of the water.\nThere was a considerable shoal extending out from the shore, opposite\nto his huts, upon which the fish, in their migrations along the\nislets came in great numbers.  At the outer edge of this shoal he had\nsunk, a few feet below the surface of the water, a long line of\ncocoa-nut leaves, which were dry, and of a reddish colour.  One end\nof the line of leaves was taken to the shore, and made fast, where\nthere was a pen, built of stone.  The line was then taken round upon\nthe shoal semi-circularly, encompassing a considerable portion of it,\nand the space between the other end of the line and the shore left\nquite open.  When a school of fish is seen, the natives intercept\nthem, driving them through this open space, and, pressing forward,\nfinally into the stone pen, from which they are taken with nets.\nAfter all the arrangements were made, Lugoma and another native,\nwaded out beyond the line of leaves, to watch the schools of fish,\nbut, unfortunately, he allowed them all to escape; and, as well as\nourselves, seemed to be a good deal disappointed with his bad\nsuccess.  What appeared to be most remarkable about this method of\ncatching fish, is that, after they are inclosed, they will not pass\nunder the cocoa-nut leaves, although there is a depth of several feet\nwater between them and the bottom.  Lugoma took me to the place where\nhe had planted the water-melon seeds, I gave him at the time of our\nparting.  He had cleared and mellowed the ground with care,\npreparatory to planting the seeds, which were already up, and looked\nthrifty.  I bestowed upon him a great deal of praise, and planted a\nvariety of other seeds, of fruit and vegetables, of which he promised\nto have an abundant supply for me, when I should again return.  When\nnight came, and the hour of repose was at hand, I was perplexed with\nthe difficulty of providing for our security against surprise or\ntreachery, without giving Lugoma reason to suppose that we did not\nconfide in his friendship, which I knew he would infer, from any\nparticular watchfulness on our part.  I did not believe that we had\nreason to apprehend danger from Lugoma or any one else, but as we\nwere exposed to it, and had the means of security, I was determined\nnot to run any risk.  Three of the men were sent to sleep in the\nboat, anchored off a short distance from the shore, and which Lugoma\nwas told no one must approach.  The rest were directed to bring their\narms on shore, and keep a lookout through the night, in rotation.\nWhen the arrangement was made, and we had all lain down, except the\nman that was standing sentry, Lugoma saw him, and asked, if there was\nnot room enough for him to lay down.  We answered evasively several\ntimes, with a view to satisfy the uneasiness he expressed, lest he\nshould be thought wanting in any respect in hospitality; but were at\nlast obliged to tell him, that the man was keeping watch, to see that\nno one came to hurt us.  His mortification was evident, as he\nremarked, in reply, that no one would come to his island to hurt us.\nWe expressed our full confidence in his friendship, giving him the\nfurther information, that it was our custom always to have some one\non the look-out.  Lugoma arranged mats upon the floors of his huts\nfor us all, and invited me to lay down on one side of him, having his\nwife and daughter on the other side.  It blew and rained hard all\nnight, but the morning was clear and pleasant.  We set off on a visit\nto an islet a few miles beyond that of Lugoma.  He offered to go with\nus, and dive for a large shell-fish, found there; but as we could not\ntake him, without incommoding ourselves, we declined his company.\nThe islet was so uninteresting, as hardly to repay us for the trouble\nof going to it.  It was covered with a thick growth of hard red wood,\ncommon to most of the low islands, and wild bup.  We soon took our\ndeparture from it, and returned to Lugoma's islet, at an early hour\nof the day.\n\nFor the first time, at the Mulgraves', I observed, in one of Lugoma's\nhuts, a drum, resembling those of Nooaheeva, but of small dimensions.\nI supposed it was an instrument of music, and in compliance with my\nrequest, Lugoma readily consented to play on it.  Calling his\ndaughter to him, he bade her thump upon it with her hands, whilst he\nsung, in time with the music, a few short lines, throwing himself in\na variety of attitudes, alternately extending one arm, with great\nvigour, and drawing the other to his breast.  Upon inquiring what was\nthe subject of his song, he told me, through Huzzy, that it was the\nmassacre of the white men,--a rudeness, I did not expect,--even from\nthe untutored Lugoma.  I declined any further display of his musical\npowers.  When we were preparing to return on board, Lugoma came to me\nseveral times, saying, that I might just as well cut his throat, as\nto lake Huzzy away from him.  \"I have no one,\" said he, with a\ndistressed look, \"that is equally capable of assisting me, to work my\ncanoe, and now, he is going away with his musket, my enemies can come\nand kill me.\"  Finding, at last, that he could not prevail upon us to\nleave Huzzy, he said, we must bring him back very soon.  That, if we\nwere long absent, we should not find him living.  He said, that we\nmust bring him clothes, like ours; guns and axes; and that we should\nshare the government of his islet with him, promising to have an\nabundant supply for us, of all the fruits and vegetables we had\nplanted.\n\nWhen he and the old women had taken an affectionate leave of Huzzy,\nhe requested me to take two or three females in my boat, with their\nbaskets of fish, which were intended as a present to the high chief,\nand land them upon the islet where he lived.  We consented to do so,\nand, after landing them, arrived on board late in the afternoon, the\nschooner having run down to the Globe's anchorage, where she was now\nlying.\n\nOn the following morning Lugoma made his appearance on the beach,\nwith his little son, having landed with his canoe upon the opposite\nside of the narrow islet.  A boat was sent to bring them off.  The\nchief stared wildly round, astonished, and wondering at every thing\nhe saw.  He was very timid, and, notwithstanding our kind reception,\nappeared to feel extremely doubtful of his safety.  His confidence\nwas in a measure gained, however, when we gave him an axe, a piece of\ncotton handkerchiefs, and some other trifles; and he left us,\nreminding me of my promise to return.  Not long after his departure\nwe got underway, and ran back to the residence of the chiefs, where,\nat ten, A.M., we came to in our old anchorage.\n\nThe captain went on shore, and at two, P.M., December the eighth,\nreturned on board with the high chief, and two others.  They were\nshown every thing about the deck, but without awakening much apparent\ncuriosity.  We then beat to quarters, and let them see what a\nformidable appearance we made, arrayed for battle,--an appearance,\ntruly ridiculous to one accustomed to the imposing effect of a fine\nship of war, and calculated to excite our risibility, notwithstanding\nthe seeming gravity we assumed for the occasion.  The captain asked\nthe high chief, if he did not wish to hear one of the cannon fired,\nto which he answered evasively, unwilling, I suppose, to acknowledge\nhis fears, as he had been a great warrior in his time.  The captain\nthen told him, that he would have one of them fired, if he was not\nafraid, which brought the chief to a confession, that he dared not\nhear it.  The chiefs brought a number of presents for the Tamon,[10]\nas they called the captain, consisting principally of mats.\n\nWhen they became tired of remaining on board, and expressed a wish to\nbe sent on shore, we gratified them, and got underway.  The high\nchief's son, who had visited me a number of times before, and to whom\nI had made presents of trifling value, but important to him, came on\nboard with his father, and expressed a wish to go with me.  His\nfather gave his consent, being perfectly willing that he should go;\nbut as there was great probability an opportunity would never offer\nfor him to return, I thought it would be cruel to take him from his\nnative islands, where, in his father's inheritance, he would be so\nwell provided for.\n\nIt was late in the evening when we got underway, at the Mulgraves,\nfor the last time.  We had surveyed all that part of the islands\nintervening between our first anchorage and the Globe's landing, and\nnow steered to the eastward by the bearings we had previously taken.\nSqualls of wind and heavy rain coming on, we soon lost sight of the\nland.  The loud roaring of the surf, off the extreme north-eastern\npoint, as well as the heavy swell that set in immediately afterwards,\napprised us that we had cleared the group.  The land was in sight\nfrom the mast-head, in the morning, when we ran down for the eastern\nend of the island, where we had first anchored, and at a convenient\ndistance run along upon the weather side, taking hearings at the end\nof every base of three or four miles.  Near the centre of the\nwindward part of the group we passed a wide opening into the inland\nsea, not far from which was a reef of considerable extent, where a\nvery high surf was breaking.  Within a short distance of the reef, we\nsaw the bottom plainly in ten fathoms water.  There was no place on\nthe weather side of the islands, where it was possible to land with\nany degree of safety.  After passing the extreme northern point we\nsteered off, with the trending of the land W. by S.; and, at\nsun-down, were up with the island, from whence I had taken Lay,\nhaving sailed nearly round the group.  Here we hove to for the night.\n\nThe group of Mulgrave Islands, as they are called, form a circular\nchain of narrow strips of land, which are no where more than half a\nmile wide, inclosing within the circle an inland sea, one hundred and\nforty miles in circumference, filled with shoals and reefs of coral.\nIt is every where bounded on the sea-side, by a bank of coral, that\nprotects it from the violence of the ocean.  This bank generally\nextends but a short distance from the shore, when it goes off into\nunfathomable water.  At the chief's islet, where we buried the\nsurgeon, it was wider than at any other place about the group, being\nupwards of a cable's length, which, for a low coral island, may be\nconsidered good anchorage.  The whole circle is broken alternately\ninto clumps, a few feet above the water, of level and low coral\nreefs, some of which are above high-water mark, and some sufficiently\nlow to afford a passage for boats.  The clumps vary in length, but\nnone of them are more than two miles long, without an interruption of\na dry or drowned reef.  They are covered with a thick growth of\nbushes, and trees of small size, except where the cocoa-nut and\nbread-fruit trees rear their tall heads, and wide-spreading branches.\nWherever these grow, the underwood disappears, and the place has the\nappearance of an old forest, cleared for a pleasure ground, where a\nfew trees have been left standing, for the advantage of their shade.\n\nThe bread-fruit tree is of two kinds.  One is the same as that, which\nis found at the Society, Sandwich, and many other islands of the\nPacific.  This has no seed, and can only be produced by cuttings from\nthe tree, or shoots, that spring up from the roots.  The other kind\nis seminal, and very much superior to the first.  It was not the\nbread-fruit season, when we were at the Mulgraves, and much to our\nregret, we could not obtain any of the seeds of this rare and\nvaluable plant.  This tree, in general, attains a size considerably\nlarger than that of the common bread-fruit.  The leaf of the\nbread-fruit tree strongly resembles that of the fig, and any one, who\nhas seen the latter, would immediately recognise it, by the\nresemblance, and the fine rich foliage it bears, when growing\nluxuriantly.  This is by far the most important production of the\nMulgrave Islands.  When the fruit is not blasted, as sometimes\nhappens, there is a great plenty for the inhabitants.  It lasts,\nhowever, only for a few weeks; and it is to be presumed, that the\nnatives have no way of preserving it, in a dried or baked state, as\nis practised with many of the South Sea Islanders, none having been\nseen by us during our stay.  The cocoa-nut tree is next in value to\nthe natives.  Of this food there is an ample supply, unless the fruit\nis blasted.  When the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut, both fail in the\nsame year, the natives experience great distress, and are reduced to\nthe necessity of living upon a fruit, they call bup.  It is commonly\nused by the poorest people, and in small quantities by the chiefs at\nall times.  It grows upon almost all the islands in the West Pacific;\nbut, when wild, is much inferior to that growing on the trees, which\nhave a clear open space around them.\n\nLay lived upon the wild bup for a considerable time after the\nmassacre, when residing with the poor old man, who saved his life,\nand before the high chief took compassion on him.  It has a sweet\ntaste, like the juice of a green corn-stalk.  Bread-fruit,\ncocoa-nuts, and bup, is the only food of the inhabitants of the\nMulgrave Islands, except at the season of the year, when great\nnumbers of fish are taken.  The industrious and enterprising have an\nabundant supply at that period; but it is only whilst the season\nlasts, as they are not in the practice of preserving them.  The\nbup-tree is the most remarkable of all the vegetable productions of\nthe Mulgrave Islands.  To shipwrecked seamen, it might be the means\nof sustaining life, when no other food could be found, and, as it is\na never-failing resource, it ought to be generally known amongst\nthose, who navigate the Pacific Ocean.  The tree generally grows from\ntwenty to thirty feet high,--sometimes singly, but more frequently in\nsmall clusters.  The diameter of the body rarely exceeds six inches.\nIt has a hard thick bark, but the wood is spongy, like that of the\ncocoa-nut tree.  It stands on from half a dozen to a dozen roots or\nprongs, by which it is propped up two or three feet from the ground.\nThe fruit is an exact resemblance of a pine-apple.  Its smell, when\nripe, is at first agreeable, but, so powerful, that it soon becomes\noffensive.  The taste of the ripe fruit has much the same\neffect--agreeable at first, like a mellow, sweet apple, but cloying\nand nauseous to the stomach, when taken in any quantity.  The ripe\nfruit is never eaten by the natives of the Mulgraves.  When green, it\nis not considered in a state to be eaten, until a beard, which grows\nout alongside of the stem, has acquired a length of four or five\ninches.  It may then be taken from the tree, and eaten raw, or\nroasted between hot stones.  The soft part of the seeds (if I may so\ncall them) is alone palatable, the other part being hard and tough.\nThe manner of eating it is, to twist the soft part off with the\nteeth, whereby the juice is expressed.  There was but little about\nthe islands that would excite the interest of either the botanist or\nnaturalist.  We saw but few flowers or plants.  The islands were\nswarming with a species of small rat, that had a tuft of hair upon\nits tail.  The natives spoke of them as being very troublesome.  By\nthrowing a small quantity of food upon the ground, near one of the\nhuts, dozens of them could be collected together in a few moments.\n\nWhen one of the natives is sick, the friends collect at the hut,\nwhere he is lying, and chant over him, to appease the offended spirit\nthat has afflicted him.  The same prescription is given for all\ndiseases, which is a tea, made from an herb found upon the island.\nIf death takes place, the friends of the deceased assemble, and mourn\nover the body, keeping it until it becomes very offensive.\nFrequently, in the midst of their most bitter mourning and\nlamentation, some of the mourners will intentionally say or do\nsomething calculated to excite mirth, when they all burst out into\nimmoderate laughter, as if their mourning were the affectation of\nchildren, and as soon as the humorous excitement has passed over,\nagain relapse into their mournful strain of howling and chaunting.\nWhen the body can be kept no longer, and the day of interment\narrives, the grave is dug, and the corpse taken upon sticks, and\ncarried to it by the friends of the deceased, followed by a large\nconcourse, who move along without order, and some one occasionally\nbreaks in upon their solemnity by a humorous trick, which gives rise\nto others, and sets them all laughing.  This is soon again succeeded\nby mourning.  The body is lowered into the grave, and covered up,\nwhen a little canoe, with a sail to it, and laden with small pieces\nof cocoa-nut or other food, having been previously prepared, is taken\nto the sea-shore on the leeward part of the island, and sent off,\nwith a fair wind, to bear far away from the island the spirit of the\ndeceased, that it may not afterwards disturb the living.  This\nceremony is considered indispensably necessary, and is never\nneglected.  At the head of the grave a cocoa-nut is planted, the tree\nthat springs from which, is held sacred, and its fruits never eaten,\nin times of the greatest famine.  Their burial places are usually a\nshort distance back of the houses, and the females are strictly\nprohibited from going to them.\n\nTheir marriages are conducted with but little ceremony.  If a man\nfancies a female for his wife, he makes the proposal to her, which,\nif agreeable, he applies to her friends.  They meet, and hold a\nconsultation, as to the propriety of the match, and decide whether it\nshall take place.  If the man's suit is denied, nothing more is said\non the subject.  When united, they are said to be very faithful, and\njealous of each other's chastity.  Lay or Huzzy related an\noccurrence, that took place during their residence on the islands,\nwhich shows how keenly a sense of injury is felt by them, and that\njealousy sometimes inspires them with the most ferocious and deadly\nrevenge.  A young man had taken a young woman for a wife, whom he\nsupposed to be a virgin.  In a very short time after she went to live\nwith him, however, it was evident that she was pregnant, and before\nthe period which nature has prescribed had elapsed, gave birth to a\nchild.  The indignant husband took the infant from its mother's arms,\nand in her presence dashed its head upon a stone in front of his hut.\nIt was an act for which, under other circumstances, he would have\nsuffered death, by a custom of the islands, forbidding the destroying\nof human life; and, as the female was of superior rank to the man,\nbeing the daughter of a chief, it was believed that he would be\npunished.  Her friends were loud in their calls for justice upon the\noffender, until a council of the chiefs was called, and the matter\nbrought before them.\n\nAfter an investigation, the chiefs were satisfied, that the woman had\ngrossly imposed upon her husband, whom they suffered to depart\nwithout censure.  It is permitted to the men to have as many wives as\nthey can get; but as food is very scarce, and they find it difficult\nto support one, there are few, even of the chiefs, who have more.\nThe high chief was the only exception to this remark at the time of\nour visit.  He had six, one of whom was a particular favourite.\n\nLatuano, the high chief of the Mulgraves, was called the greatest\nwarrior that the islands had produced for a long time.  He told us\nthat in one of his wars he was driven from his islands, and remained\n(I think) fourteen days at sea in his canoe, most of the time out of\nsight of land.  He steered for an island, which, according to the\ntradition of his countrymen, lay to the west of the Mulgraves, and,\nafter a great deal of suffering, arrived there in safety.  The high\nchief of this isle (south Pedder's Island) received him with\nkindness, and after he had visited thirteen different islands of the\ngroup,[11] sent him back to the Mulgraves with a fleet of canoes, and\na great many men.  He arrived there in safety, conquered his enemies,\nand at the time of our visit was tributary to the chief of Pedder's\nIsland, who had given him a daughter or grand-daughter in marriage.\nThey told us that every few years the chief of Pedder's Island, who\nis very powerful and very wise, sends a fleet of canoes to the\nMulgraves, for tribute.  Lay and Huzzy were to have been sent to him,\nas also the Globe's whaleboat and swivel.  I was particularly struck\nwith Latuanos' strong resemblance to General Bolivar.  His stature\nwas about the same, and his face bore the same marks of care and\nserious thought, when his attention was not awakened to any\nparticular thing; and, when animated by conversation, the same vivid\nexpression beamed from his fine features, and sparkling black eyes.\nI could not but think, when I was looking at him, that if he and\nGeneral Bolivar could be placed near to each other, similarly\ndressed, it would be difficult to tell which was the Indian chief,\nand which the patriot hero.\n\nThe high chief is absolute in his authority, but, in the\nadministration of justice, particularly where the life of an\nindividual is concerned, he is influenced in passing judgment by the\nopinion of the chiefs of most consequence.[12]  Like all other men,\nwhether civilized or uncivilized, they have different grades of rank\nin their society, from the high chief down to the farthest remove of\nrelationship to royalty.  The different islets that are inhabited,\nare partitioned off to different chiefs, who acknowledge their\nsubordination to the high chief, by sending him a part of whatever\ngrows, or is taken within the limits of their government.  They send\nhim a portion of their cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and bup, and of the\nfish or birds, that may be caught by themselves or any of their\npeople.  The high chief requires this for the support of his numerous\nfamily.  Besides his wives and children, he usually keeps a large\nnumber of men about him, who go in his canoe, and perform other\nessential duties in his service.  Several of the principal chiefs are\nalso in attendance, and live with him constantly.  In his family,\nthere is no ceremony, to remind the common people of their lowly\ncondition.  They all eat, drink, and sleep alike.  In dress, there is\nnothing to distinguish the chiefs from the common people, except that\nthe former sometimes wear a mat that comes down to the knee, of\nstraw, and finely wrought.  This, however, I believe, is only worn\nupon particular occasions.\n\nThe men wear bunches of grass hanging down before and behind, such as\nI have described at our first anchorage, being about the size and\nappearance of a horse's tail.  Those in most common use, were of a\nreddish colour; but a few of them were white.  The bark of which they\nare made is taken from a long running vine.  The boys go quite naked\nuntil they are ten or twelve years old, when a dress similar to that\nof the men is put on them.  Their ornaments consist of shell\nbracelets and necklaces, and sometimes a string of thorn is put round\nthe head; flowers, when they can be obtained, are often used instead\nof shells.  Many of the men, and some of the women have large slits\nin their ears, through which they put rolls of leaves from one to two\ninches in diameter.  The women wear beautiful white straw mats, of\nelegant workmanship, about two feet square, and sometimes larger,\nbordered round the edge, from one to two inches, with black diamond\nfigures, worked in with coloured straw, died with the husk of the\ncocoa-nut.  They usually wear two of these mats, one of which is\nbehind and the other before, tied round the waist with a beautiful\nround cord of braided straw.  The ornaments of the women are the same\nas those worn by the men.  They have no manner of worship.  They\nacknowledge the existence of a Great Spirit whom they call Kenneet,\nand who, they say, can make them sick and kill them: they look for\nnothing good from him, and, so far as I could learn, have no idea of\nrewards and punishments after death.  They have a sort of conjurers\namongst them, for whose art they entertain great reverence, and in\nwhom they place a strict reliance.  To them they apply in all cases\nof great emergency.  Their art consists in having a large bunch of\nstraws, which they fold double and tie in a great many different\nways; if, after the straws are thus folded, doubled, and tied, they\ncan be drawn out without being in any manner entangled the one with\nthe other, the omen is propitious; but otherwise, the contemplated\nundertaking is relinquished.  On the following morning it is again\nresorted to, and so on until success is promised.  It must never be\ntried but in the morning, and only once on the same day.  The morning\nI took Lay from the natives, the chiefs had recourse to this art\nbefore they would allow him to speak to us; they were promised good\nfortune, otherwise he would have been concealed from us.  He who\ncannot perform the mysteries of this art, is not allowed to drink\nfrom the same cup with him who can.\n\nThey had a great aversion to hearing us whistle, particularly in\ntheir houses, and would invariably run up to any of our people when\nthey were whistling, and with a fearful look, beg them to stop;\nsaying, it would bring spirits about the house that would make them\nsick and kill them.  If one of them has wronged another who has died,\nor if they were enemies, he never eats without throwing away a\nportion[13] of his food to appease the ghost of the departed.\n\nAt a meeting we had with the chiefs on shore, the captain remarked an\nold man in the circle, whose name and character he asked of Lay or\nHuzzy; being replied to, he said, in a stern manner that he did not\nlike his face, meaning that he looked like a bad man.  The old\nfellow, seeing himself the subject of conversation, asked the\ninterpreter what the captain was saying about him.  On being told,\nhis countenance expressed the utmost dismay, and in a day or two\nafterwards, he died.  There was not a native on the islands with whom\nLay or Huzzy conversed, that did not believe the captain's dislike\nkilled the old man.  They seemed to entertain the most singular\nnotions of the captain's supernatural powers.\n\nFor the purpose of ascertaining what idea the high chief entertained\nof a God, the captain asked him several questions, to which his\nanswers were vague and unsatisfactory.  He thought he had conceived\nthe right one, when he asked the chief who he thought made it\nthunder.  After a moment's hesitation, he looked at the captain and\nreplied, \"I suppose you can make it thunder.\"  This was as\nsatisfactory as any thing he could be made to express.  Thunder he\nbelieved was produced by the agency of a being superior to himself,\nand the captain he conceived to be infinitely his superior.\n\nNot long after the massacre of the white men, the natives were\nvisited by a disease that caused their limbs to swell, and produced\ngreat distress amongst them; it was before unknown, and they ascribed\nit to Lay and Huzzy, who, they believed, had the power to afflict\nthem in that manner, and had done it to be revenged for the death of\ntheir countrymen.  They finally charged them with it, and threatened\nto kill them, which, in all probability they would have done, but for\ntheir superstitious fear of some greater evil.\n\nTheir huts are not, generally, more than ten by fifteen feet, and\nfrom ten to fifteen feet high.  They are divided into two apartments,\nupper and lower; the lower is open all round, without any thatching;\nthe floor is raised a little above the adjacent ground, and covered\nover with small pieces of the cleanest and whitest coral that can be\nfound.  The rafters and small sticks that are laid across them for\nthe thatching, are secured by twine made from the outer husk of\ncocoa-nut, with which the thatching is also secured.  The thatch is\nthe leaves of palm or cocoa-nut.  The ceiling of the lower room is\ngenerally so low, that one must bend almost double to get into it,\nand if you remain, it must be in a lying or sitting posture.  The\ngarret has a floor of sticks thickly interwoven with leaves; it is\nhigher than the ground floor, and has an air of comfort.  The natives\nkeep their provisions in it, and all such things as they would\npreserve from the rats.  They also sleep there in wet weather.  In\nthe floor, a hole is left just large enough for a person to crawl\nthrough, and so far from the sides that the rats cannot get to it.\n\nTheir canoes display the greatest ingenuity, and I have no doubt,\nthat in a civilized country, they would be ranked amongst the rarest\nspecimens of human industry, unassisted but by the rudest implements.\nThe model is most singular, and differs from all that I have ever\nseen in use, either in the European or American world.  Its\nconstruction is so remarkable, and in many respects so inconvenient,\nthat it seems improbable the model should have had its origin in any\nother cause than the want of suitable timber for a more perfect\nstructure.  The depth of a Mulgrave canoe, of common size, is four or\nfive feet; its length from thirty to forty.  It is so narrow that a\nman can scarcely stand in it; perfectly flat on one side, and round\non the other.  It is sharp at both ends.  The mast is from twelve to\ntwenty-five feet long, and the sail, (a straw mat,) which is bent to\na small yard, is very large in proportion to the canoe.  They always\nsail on the flat side, and have the mast a little inclined forward.\nIt is supported by shrouds and a guy at either end, which is used at\npleasure to give the mast its proper inclination.  In beating to\nwindward, instead of tacking as we do, and presenting the other side\nof the boat to the wind, they bring the other end of the boat to it,\nmaking that the bow which was before the stern.  Amidships there are\nseveral light spars extending about ten feet over the round side, and\nfour over the other.  Across these are smaller sticks, which are\nsecurely lashed above and below, and over them is made a platform.\nUpon that part of it which extends over the flat side, they have a\nsmall thatched cabin, in which they store whatever they wish to\npreserve from getting wet, or would conceal from observation.  The\nother part of the platform is intended to keep the canoe from being\nupset; and when hard pressed with carrying sail, several men will\nsometimes get on it, to keep the canoe upright.  They move through\nthe water with astonishing velocity, and, in turning to windward, no\nboats can surpass them.  Although the natives had no other tools to\nwork with than what they made of shells, previous to the visit of the\nGlobe, every article of their workmanship is neat, and as highly\npolished as though it had been wrought with steel.  In the\nconstruction of their canoes, the keel-stern and sternpost are solid\npieces of hard wood, upon which they are built up of small pieces\nlaid one above the other, and closely seized on with the line of\ncocoa-husk.  The seams are neither caulked or payed, and the canoe\nconsequently leaks so much as to require one man to bail constantly.\nThe steerage is very laborious; they have no rudder, and the only\nmeans by which they steer, is with a long flat paddle held in the\nhands of the helmsman.  To steer a large canoe in blowing weather,\nrequires the utmost strength of six or eight men.  Upon the\noutriggers or platforms, and along the masts, they arrange their\nspears, which are always taken with them, even upon the most ordinary\noccasions.  The canoes are also always ballasted with a quantity of\nround stones, weighing about a pound each, which forms a material\npart of their armament.  Our carpenter was several days at work upon\nthe canoe of the high chief, caulking and graving her.  When he had\ncompleted his work, the high chief, after expressing his\ngratification, earnestly solicited the captain to leave him on the\nisland; he said that he would always provide him an abundance to eat,\nand that no one should ever hurt him.  This, according to the high\nchief's standard, was the most ample reward that he could promise for\nuseful services.\n\nThe people of the Mulgraves are in general of moderate stature, and\nwell made.  Their complexion is not so dark as that of the natives of\nthe Duke of Clarence and Byron's Island, and their features more\ncomely.  They appeared to us like a different race of men.  They have\nnot the flat noses and thick lips of the low islanders, except that\ntwo or three persons we saw would come under that description.  Their\nhair is long and invariably combed out with great neatness, and tied\non the top of their heads.  Their deportment is modest and manly, and\nafter one becomes a little accustomed to their dress, they have\nalways an air of gentility.  They have a fine majestic walk, which\none would hardly suppose, when it is considered that their way is\neverywhere paved with sharp coral.\n\nAfter we had given them the pigs, it was amusing to see with what\napparent pleasure they carried them about in their arms, nursing them\nwith as much care and tenderness, as though they had been children,\nwhilst the pigs, unused to such treatment, were kicking and\nscratching the naked bodies of the poor natives, and squealing away\nmost lustily.  We had to interfere to keep the pigs from being killed\nwith kindness, and finally prevailed upon the chief to forbid their\nbeing petted in this style.  It is not improbable that, in a few\nyears, the whalers that may have occasion to cruise, in the vicinity\nof these islands, will find an abundant supply.  It is hoped,\nhowever, that until they become numerous, no navigator who may chance\nto touch there, will encourage the natives to diminish their number.\n\nAt 4, A.M., on the 9th of December, we took our departure from the\nMulgrave Islands, and stood to the westward.  At daylight, we had\nlost sight of the group, and at 10, A.M., made South Pedder's Island.\nHaving stood a little too far to the southward, we were all day\nbeating up to weather the N.E. point, where, at sun-down, we hove to\nin the hope that on the following morning we should be able to effect\na landing, and get a sight of the great chief, so celebrated amongst\nthe people we had just left.  On the 11th of December, having passed\nall the early part of the day searching in vain for anchorage, we\nhove to, a little after meridian, opposite to a considerable bay,\nupon the shore of which was a native village, and large forests of\ncocoa-nut trees.  The captain took Huzzy in the gig, and, followed by\nanother boat, pulled in over a wide coral bank to the village.  A few\npeople were attracted to the shore by the appearance of our boats.\nThey immediately conducted the captain to the chief, who was seated\non a mat in the open air, in front of his hut.  He seemed but little\nmoved at the unexpected appearance of his visitors.  He was a very\nold man, and had a long white beard that came down upon his breast.\nThe natives stood round in respectful silence, as the old chief\naddressed the captain, whom he soon distinguished as the person of\nhighest rank amongst the strangers.  He spoke the same language as\nthe inhabitants of the Mulgraves, and Huzzy was forbidden to let him\nknow that he was understood, but to listen attentively to what he was\nsaying to those around him.  For a time his intercourse with the\ncaptain was carried on by signs, and Huzzy overheard him say to the\nnatives, standing by, \"Don't disturb them yet.  Wait until to-morrow,\nand see what they are going to do.  They will look round here to see\nwhat they can find, trade a little, and go on board of their vessel,\nto sleep, and to-morrow they will come again.\"  When the captain told\nHuzzy to address some questions to the chief in his own language, it\nseemed to operate as quickly as an electric shock upon the natives,\nwho stared wildly around at him, and at each other, with looks of the\nutmost astonishment.  The chief partially lost his gravity in the\nsensation it produced, being not less surprised than his subjects.\nHe asked Huzzy, before answering the question put to him, where he\nhad learned to speak the language of Pedder's Island.  Huzzy replied,\nthat he had learned it at the Mulgrave Islands, where he had been for\ntwo years.  The old chief said, that he had been informed of two\nwhite men being there, and was then fitting out a fleet of canoes to\nsend after them.  He expressed a great deal of disappointment, that\nwe had taken them away, saying, he would have had them brought to his\nown island, and treated them well.  He asked, if Lay was also on\nboard of the vessel.  The captain had taken on shore a present for\nthe chief, and a number of trifles, that he thought might be\nacceptable to the natives.  Our people endeavoured to obtain a\nquantity of cocoa-nuts and bup, of which there was the greatest\nabundance; but the natives parted with their fruit very reluctantly.\nWhen finally the captain addressed the chief, upon the subject of\ngiving or selling us a supply, he said,--No! that his island was\nthickly inhabited, and produced no more food than was necessary for\nhis people.  That, if we were in want of cocoa-nuts and bup, there\nwere other islands, not far to the westward, where there was an\nabundance, and but few people, and he advised our going there as\nspeedily as possible.  Upon being asked, if he had ever seen white\nmen before, he replied,--Yes; that a long time ago there came a large\nvessel, in which there were white men, who brought their forge on\nshore, where they remained for several days.  This, he said, was the\nonly instance.  The young women were all sent away, and concealed in\nthe thickets, or upon a distant part of the island, where they\nremained during the whole day.\n\nAmongst other presents made by the captain to the high chief, was a\nbattle-axe,--to him an article of the greatest value.  He received\nit, however, with reluctance, expressing his regret, that he had it\nnot in his power to make a suitable return for so valuable a\nconsideration, accompanying his apology with a small present of mats,\ncocoa-nuts, and a preparation of the ripe bup, that had an agreeable\nsweet taste.  It was after dark when our party left the village, and\nwent to the beach to embark.  They had already left the shore a few\nyards, when some natives came running down, and called for them to\nreturn, saying, the chief had another mat for the captain.  They\nlanded, when they were told, that the mat was in the village, and\nthat Huzzy must go for it.  The captain, not choosing to send for the\nmat, put off again.  In a few moments two or three other messengers\ncame running to the beach, calling for the boat to return.  When she\nhad pulled in a few yards from the shore, they said that the chief\nwanted Huzzy to go up to the village for the mat, and that he did not\nwish to keep the axe, which he had sent back to the captain,\nunwilling, as we supposed, to lay himself under so great an\nobligation as its acceptance implied.  The captain refused to take\nthe axe, telling the messenger to say to his chief, that what we had\ngiven, we never took back, and, with this, left the shore and\nreturned on board.  The tide had risen considerably over the coral\nbank, and the party found the surf somewhat dangerous in returning,\nhaving their boats nearly filled with water.\n\nThe dress and general appearance of these people, as well as their\nlanguage, was the same as that of the natives of the Mulgraves.\nTheir canoes were also the same.  We saw only three or four with\nsails, which were hauled upon the beach.  The power of the great\nchief must, therefore, consist in his dominion over other islands to\nthe northward and westward of him, where there is an almost connected\nchain for several hundred miles, and from which, when he undertakes\nan important enterprise, he must, in a great measure, draw his\nresources.  It was probably with the object of collecting forces for\nthe great chief, that Latuano visited so many islands during his\nexile from his own, and to which he was at last restored by foreign\naid.\n\nAt eight in the evening, we made sail to the northward and westward,\nwith a fresh breeze from the eastward.  The weather was clear, and we\nstood on under easy sail all night.  Early in the morning land was\ndiscovered, bearing nearly west, and soon afterwards more land was\nseen to the north.  The last was Ibbitson's Island, and appeared to\nbe separate from that discovered first.  It is not improbable,\nhowever, that they are connected by coral reefs, that were too\ndistant from us to be observed.\n\nThe land was all low, and had the appearance of the Mulgraves and\nother coral islands.  At meridian, we hove to, and put off in two\nboats.  Having passed to leeward of the island, we crossed a drowned\nreef, that extended as far as the eye could reach to the N.W., when\nwe found ourselves in an inland sea, which was extensive and quite\nsmooth.  That part of the island where we landed was about five miles\nlong, and a quarter of a mile wide.  Upon the margin of the inland\nsea, there were a number of huts, but when we landed, not an\ninhabitant could be seen.  The huts had evidently been but recently\noccupied.  The island was covered abundantly with cocoa-nut and bup\ntrees, and a few of the bread-fruit were here and there to be seen.\nOn the shore of the inland sea the water was smooth and unruffled,\nand the humble but neat dwellings of the natives, scattered about\namongst the cocoa forests, presented a scene of quiet and repose,\npeculiarly soothing to the mind, contrasted with the eternal war of\nbreakers on the ocean side.  We had not been long on shore before we\nfound a few old people, who had concealed themselves in the bushes,\nand, although they were at first afraid of us, they became less\ntimid, and increased in number, when we had presented them with some\npieces of iron, and a few old buttons.  In return, they gave us mats,\nfishing-nets, cocoa-nuts, and bup, with the last of which they filled\nour boat.  Their dress and language was the same as at the Mulgraves,\nand their habitations and canoes were also the same.  Amongst all\nthese islands, the natives ascend the cocoa-nut trees, in the way I\nhave described at the Marquesas.  Here we saw several very old\npeople, some of whom had lost all their teeth,--a circumstance we had\nnot before remarked in any of these islands.  There were also two or\nthree cripples, who were not less remarkable, being the first we had\nseen.  All the females were very old, and, upon inquiring the cause,\nthey replied, that the young men had sent the young women away, for\nfear they would be given presents.  Two or three large sail canoes\ncame from a great distance over the inland sea, and approached us\nwithout fear.  The natives told us that they had never seen white men\nbefore.\n\nThe captain landed upon a different island from myself, and the\nnatives, having fled from their habitations as they did upon the\nisland where I landed, he sent a few old people, that were found,\ncommanding all the inhabitants to return to their homes, and, fearing\nhis displeasure, in a few minutes their huts were occupied in the\nsame manner as though the white-faced strangers had not appeared\namongst them.\n\nAt five, P.M., we returned to the schooner, with our boats laden with\nfruit, and soon afterwards made sail, shaping our course for the\nSandwich Islands.  We were favoured with south easterly trades,\nblowing in fresh gales for a number of days, which rendered our\npassage materially shorter than it would probably have been\notherwise.  But what was still less to have been expected than a\nsouth-east trade in the northern tropic, was a strong current, that\nset us at the rate of thirty to forty miles a day, N.E. from the\nlatitude of sixteen to twenty-five north.  Part of the time that we\nexperienced this strong current, the wind was blowing a double-reefed\ntop-sail breeze from East and E.N.E., differing only from two to four\npoints with the opposite direction of the current.  When we arrived\nin the latitude of twenty-three degrees north, the trades left us,\nand the winds became variable.  At meridian of December the 24th, we\nwere, by our calculation, thirty miles from an island, said to have\nbeen discovered recently by a whaler, and which we made to bear from\nus E. by N.  Our latitude observed was twenty-five degrees\nfifty-seven minutes, N. Longitude, by chronometer, one hundred and\neighty-six degrees twenty-seven minutes, W.  We ran off to the\neastward all the following day, and at meridian, December 25th,\nobserved, in latitude twenty-six degrees, N.; longitude one hundred\nand eighty-three degrees twenty minutes W., without having seen the\nslightest indications of land.\n\nOn Christmas day, we gave the crew a dinner of turtle, which were\nstill fat, and very delicious.  We had fed them occasionally upon bup\nand other vegetation, that was found upon the islands.\n\nDecember the 27th, we came within the vicinity of another new\ndiscovery of a whaler, and at meridian, had it bearing, by our\ncalculation, S.E. ten miles.  We ran for it until six, P.M., December\n28th, when no appearance of land being in sight, we hove about, and\nstood to the northward, for a newly discovered reef, which, at\nmeridian, bore from us, by calculation N. by E., distant one hundred\nmiles.  Latitude observed, twenty-six degrees ten minutes N.;\nlongitude, by chronometer, one hundred and seventy-six degrees\nfifty-one minutes, W.  The reef for which we were now steering was\ncalled, by the discoverer, Clark's Reef.  It was said to extend sixty\nmiles, in a south-west and north-easterly direction, and we thought\nit impossible that it should escape our observation, if laid down any\nwhere near the given latitude and longitude.\n\nAt nine, P.M., December the 30th, we were within twenty-five miles of\nthe centre of the reef, by our calculation, and as it was blowing a\ngale, and we were scudding before it with an unusually high sea, we\nhove to for the night.  At three, A.M., we again made sail, and ran\nfor the centre of the reef.  At meridian, December the 31st, the\ncentre of it was still twenty miles from us, bearing N. E. by N.\nFrom meridian to one, P.M., we steered N. by E., and then bore up,\nand steered east all the rest of the twenty-four hours, without\nseeing the reef or any indications of it.  At meridian, observed, in\nlatitude twenty-six degrees forty-seven minutes, N.; longitude, by\nchronometer, one hundred and seventy-two degrees eleven minutes, W.\n\nWe continued on to the eastward, with the hope of falling in with two\nislands and a reef, of another whaler's discovery.  Our confidence in\ntheir given latitude and longitude, however, was quite destroyed by\nfrequent disappointments, and we now looked for their discoveries, as\nwe would have sought for lands, known only in the tradition of the\nnatives of some unfrequented island, with the hope of finding them,\nbut with little expectation of success.  It happened with these, as\nwith all the rest of the new discoveries we had looked for.  We\npassed within a few miles of the latitude, and ran down from one to\ntwo degrees of longitude, without observing any thing that indicated\nthe vicinity of land.\n\nOn the second of January, 1826, we ran off to the southward of east\nfor Ballard's Island.  During the middle of the day, the sea, from\nbeing very heavy, became comparatively smooth, and continued so for\nsixty miles, when the heavy swell again set in from the westward, as\nbefore.\n\nAt three, P.M., on the fourth of January, a rock was reported from\nthe mast-head, eight leagues from us.  It proved to be Ballard's\nIsland, as it is called.  At eight on the following morning, we\npassed within two hundred yards of it.  It is about two or three\nhundred yards in circumference, and rises two hundred feet from the\nsea.  On one side it has a considerable inclination, where seals had\ncrawled up, and several were basking in the sun, almost to the very\ntop.  Large flocks of birds were perched upon its ragged sides, or\nwending their flight around it.  Not the least sign of vegetation was\nany where to be seen.  Near its base, was a small rock, from ten to\ntwenty feet above the water level.  Ballard's Rock rises in three\nequi-distant peaks, the centre of which is the highest, and all of\nthem, to the very base, are white with bird-lime.  A high surf breaks\nall around it.  Our observations placed it in north latitude,\ntwenty-five degrees two minuses; west longitude, one hundred and\nsixty-seven degrees fifty minutes.\n\nOn the evening of January the fifth, the weather became squally, with\nconstant flashes of lightning and distant thunder.  From south to\nwest, and N.W., the heavens were obscured with a heavy black cloud,\nwhich rose with great rapidity.  We furled all sail.  When the cloud\nascended our zenith, it became perfectly calm, and a roaring was\nheard in the air for several minutes, like that of wind through the\ntops of pines, when hail-stones of an unusual size began to fall upon\nour deck, accompanied with very sharp lightning and heavy thunder.\nThe hail was of short duration, and passed over without a breath of\nwind.\n\nThe nearest of the Sandwich Group was Bird Island, for which we\nsteered, and on the ninth of January, at eight in the morning (having\nthe preceding night been enveloped in fog) it was discovered close to\nus.  We tacked and stood close in with the south-west side, where was\na small sand-beach, fifty to a hundred yards long.\n\nThe captain, taking the Globe's whale-boat, went in shore to fish,\nbut seeing a few seal upon the sand beach, was induced to land.  It\nsoon afterwards became squally and blew with great violence.  The\nsurf upon the beach rose with the wind, and, when the captain, after\na short examination of the island, attempted to return, he found it\nimpossible to launch his boat through the surf, and was reduced to\nthe necessity of passing the night upon the island.  It blew a gale\nand rained in torrents all night.  The captain and his boat's crew\ntook shelter in a cavern upon the sea-shore, where they had not been\nlong by a comfortable fire they had made, when, by the rising of the\ntide the sea broke in upon them, and they with difficulty escaped to\nthe side of the rocks, and thence upon the sand-beach.  The island\nwas high and almost perpendicular, and with the floods that fell and\nrushed down its steep sides, rocks of a large size were disengaged\nfrom their beds, and came tumbling down in every direction, to the\ngreat peril of the captain and his boat's crew, sufficiently\nuncomfortable from the torrents of water that were falling and\ndriving upon the gale.  After a little search, they found an asylum\nin a cave at the side of a mountain, where they passed the night.  In\nthe morning, when they ascended the mountain, the schooner was no\nwhere to be seen.  It was high and steep, and she had beat up within\na few miles of the island and passed their line of sight.  Their\ndisappointment and chagrin was inexpressible, supposing, from the\nschooner's not being in sight, she had been driven off, and that it\nwould be a considerable time before she could return, and afford them\nthat relief their situation so much required, being very much\nfatigued and exhausted from their exposure.  At day-light, the\nweather cleared and the wind moderated.  We beat up and hove to off\nthe sand-beach nearly as soon as the boat we had sent with\nrefreshments.\n\nWhen the captain saw the schooner approaching close in with the\nisland, he made a last effort to launch his boat.  They succeeded in\ngetting her into the breakers, but the first heavy roller that broke\nunder them severed the boat amid-ships, and the captain upon one end\nof her and a man that could not swim on the other, were hove up\nsafely on the beach by the succeeding wave.  The rest of the boat's\ncrew were good swimmers, and also landed in safety.  Our boat was not\nfar off when this occurred, and anchoring as near as possible to the\nshore, the men, all but one, swam off to her through the surf.  The\nonly way we could devise to get the captain and seaman off, was to\nfloat a cork-jacket on shore, at the end of a line, which being put\non by the captain and seaman, alternately, and a rope tied round\nthem, they were hauled through the surf without any other injury than\nswallowing a quantity of salt-water.\n\nBird's Island is an uninhabited rock, about a league in\ncircumference, and the highest part from five to eight hundred feet\nabove the ocean.  Where our boat landed, is the only spot where a\nlanding could be effected, and upon that side alone it has an\ninclination by which it may be ascended.  Every where else it is\nperpendicular, and at a distance, looks like the work of art.  It has\na scanty vegetation.\n\nAt five, P.M., January the 11th, we made sail for the island of\nOahoo, with a fine breeze from the westward and pleasant weather.  At\ndaylight, on the following morning, we saw the small island of\nOnehow, and soon afterwards, the highland of Atooi.  During the whole\nday, we were coming up with and sailing along on the west side of\nAtooi, moving at the rate of eight and nine miles per hour.  Of a\nclear day, it may be seen at least fifty or sixty miles.  We did not\napproach nearer to it than eight or ten.  It had the appearance, at\nthat distance, of beautiful table-land, being every where very\nregular and of nearly the same altitude.  Towards evening, on the\n12th of January, we made the island of Oahoo, and should have been at\nanchor in Onavoora on the following day had we passed between Atooi\nand Oahoo, but from some mistake about the prevailing winds on the\nopposite side of Oahoo, we continued on round the north end of it,\nand did not anchor at Onavoora until the sixteenth.  Two or three\nAmerican merchant vessels were lying there, with which we exchanged\nsalutes.  The Dolphin was the first American man-of-war that ever\nentered a harbour of the Sandwich Islands, and the firing of the\nguns, and the report widely circulated that an American man-of-war\nhad arrived, brought the inhabitants from far and near to the shore\nof the harbour to witness the novel sight.  Several of our\ncountrymen, who were traders here, and had been expecting us for some\ntime, came on board to offer their congratulations, and invite us on\nshore to partake of their hospitality.  It was highly gratifying to\nus upon landing, to meet nearly all of our countrymen residing at the\nIsland, who came down, en masse, to the beach, to welcome us on\nshore, in the most kind and friendly manner.  We were a little\ndisappointed, however, when we came to look round and found that none\nof the missionaries had partaken in the general sentiment.  They were\nalso our countrymen, and from the character of benevolence and\nphilanthropy they had assumed to themselves, we had a right to expect\nthey would have been amongst the first to hail us with a welcome to\ntheir lonely abode.  We expected, indeed, that they would not only\nhave received us as countrymen, but as friends, whose kindness, and\nsympathy would be highly acceptable to them in their peculiar\nsituation.\n\nFrom the shore we were escorted to a large frame building called the\nwooden-house, then occupied by our countryman, Captain Wilds, where a\nhandsome dinner was prepared, to which every luxury was added that\ncould be obtained from the shipping or the shore.  We were much\nsurprised on landing, to find a rabble of naked and half-naked\nnatives, amounting to many hundreds, as we had been taught to\nbelieve, from the various information we had received, that their\ncondition was much improved, and that they were far advanced in\ncivilization.  They were of all ages, and formed a more varied and\nfantastic group than I had any where seen, even where no degree of\ncivilization had taken place, from an intercourse with white men.\nSome of them were quite naked; some had their native dress of tappa\ncloths; some had on cotton shirts, some a pair of old trowsers, and\nsome nothing but an old jacket.  Many of them had adorned their heads\nwith wreaths of red and yellow flowers, and some their necks and\nwrists with necklaces and bracelets of shells.  They expressed the\ngreatest pleasure at seeing us, shouting and crowding around, so that\nwe could not get along without pushing them out of the way.  In\nappearance, a comparison of them with the natives of the Marquesas or\nMulgrave Islands, would have been greatly to their disadvantage.  On\nthe following day, we were again invited to dine at the same place,\nwhere we met a second time with our countrymen, and interchanged with\nthem those sentiments of friendship and sympathy that naturally arise\non meeting in a strange land, and which are felt by Americans with\npeculiar force.  It appeared to us that they could not sufficiently\nexpress their gratification at seeing us at Oahoo, by the most\nunremitted attention, for they continued to feast and give us parties\nevery day for more than a week, and until our various and pressing\nduties made it inconvenient for us to partake of them.  On the first\nsabbath after our arrival, I went to the place of worship appointed\nby the missionaries for the natives.  A large building, formerly\noccupied for this purpose, had been destroyed a short time previous\nto our arrival, and as they had now no house sufficiently large to\ncontain the whole congregation, the place appointed for worship was\nan extensive enclosure in the rear of a large frame building, which\nis occupied as the dwelling of the young king.  Within this\nenclosure, was assembled about a thousand people, as I supposed,\nseated on the ground.  Some of them were dressed in silks, cottons,\nand calicoes, and others were in their native dress, being quite\nnaked, except about the waist.  They were in the open air, without\nany protection from the sun, which was pouring its vertical rays upon\nthem.  Mr. Bingham, the head of the mission, was addressing them in\nthe language of the island, and when he saw me at the outer edge of\nthe circle, very kindly beckoned me to come round where the queen\ndowager was seated.  He was standing there himself.  A native was\nholding an umbrella over his head, and around him were seated all the\nchief men and women, some in chairs, and some of them on the ground.\nWith one or two exceptions, they were all people of uncommon size.\nSome of them were quite neatly dressed, but others had displayed a\nmost whimsical and ridiculous fancy.  When I came near Cahumanu, who\nwas the favourite wife of the departed and highly distinguished\nTamahamaha, she extended her hand to me and bade one of her\nattendants bring me a chair.  The service lasted about an hour, when\nthe assemblage dispersed, and the natives ran away as much pleased as\nso many children let loose from school.  At the close of the service,\nI promised myself so much politeness on the part of the distinguished\npersonages present, as to receive from some of them an invitation to\ngo into their houses, as I was in the uniform of a foreign officer;\nbut in this I was altogether disappointed.  I had the satisfaction of\nspeaking, for a few minutes, with Mr. Bingham, whose attention was\nsoon called from me by the presence of some chief, with whom he\nwished to exchange a salutation, and after recognizing two or three\nof the chiefs present whom I had seen before, I was suffered to\ndepart without receiving any further notice.\n\nOn Monday, I made a call of ceremony on the high chief Boque, who was\none of the attendants of the late king Rio Rio, on his visit to the\nking of England.  He was a man of about thirty years of age, upwards\nof six feet, and stout in proportion.  He had a flat nose and thick\nlips, but the general expression of his face was that of benevolence\nand good nature--an expression truly characteristic, according to the\ntestimony of those who have had an opportunity of knowing him well.\nWe found him sitting in a chair at a table, with a desk before him,\nupon which he was making pot-hooks after a copy, having just\ncommenced learning to write.  He got up and shook hands with us, as\ndid also his wife, who was seated on some mats at the other end of\nthe hut.  Boque was dressed in a coarse linen shirt and trowsers,\nhaving a pair of heavy shoes on his feet, without any stockings.\nQueen Boque was nearly as large as her husband, and looked a good\ndeal like him.  She had on a plain white muslin cap and dress,\nneither of which were very clean or neatly put on.  It was, however,\nin as good taste as could be expected in so rude a state of society,\nbut I thought it less becoming than would have been her native dress.\nShe invited us to be seated, and made an attempt at politeness, such\nas she had seen practised in England, having accompanied her husband\nthither.  The hut was an oblong building, about sixty by forty feet.\nIts simple structure was the same that has been in use in the islands\nfrom time immemorial, being poles laid over crotches, upon which the\nrafters rested, and differing in nothing from the habitations of the\npoorest people, except that the crotches, poles, and rafters, were\nlonger, and there were more of them.  It was thatched from the top\nall the way to the ground, with a thick covering of grass.  The\ninterior was all in one apartment, from the top of the rafters to the\nhard beaten ground floor.  There was nothing ornamental, and no\nsuperfluous furniture.  A bedstead standing in one corner, with some\npieces of white tappa cloth of the island for curtains, whereon was\nlaid a pile of mats for a bed; two or three piles of mats laying\nalong near the centre of the hut, raised one or two feet from the\nfloor, by being piled one above the other, for beds or lounging\nplaces; two or three old chairs; a plain table of small dimensions,\nand a dressing-case with a mirror in it, was all of Boque's\nfurniture, either useful or ornamental.  Besides these may be\nmentioned a few hollow gourds for poye, (a favourite food of the\nSandwich Islanders, made from the tarrow,) hanging at the side of the\nhut.\n\nLeaving Boque's palace, we went with the intention of making a\nsimilar call upon the high chief Crimacu, known to strangers who have\nvisited the island, by the name of Billy Pitt.  He was the high\ncarnie, or great friend of Tamahamaha, in whose wars he was greatly\ndistinguished for personal prowess, sagacity, and wisdom.  When we\ncame to his hut, we found him sleeping in a swinging cot, with\nseveral attendants sitting round, one of whom was fanning him.  He\nwas in very ill health, having for a long time been afflicted with\nthe dropsy, and we departed without waking him.  His hut differed in\nnothing from that of Boque, except that it was not so large, and had\na greater profusion of mats in it.  It was standing in one corner of\nan extensive plain, that was partially enclosed by a wicker fence\njust at the outskirts of the town of Onaroora, and all around it was\ngrowing wild grass and weeds, except where the footsteps of the\npeople, who passed to and from the hut, had trodden them down.  It\nlooked but little like the habitation of a man who had been a great\nwarrior, and associated as second in authority with one who had\nconquered and ruled over thousands of men.  One would naturally\nsuppose that in emerging from a savage state, with absolute power, he\nwould have made an attempt, at least, to imitate the style and\nmanners of the white men with whom he was constantly meeting, and\nalways on terms of friendship.\n\nAfter we had interchanged salutes with the shore, chief Boque came on\nboard on the 17th, to make us a visit of ceremony.  He was dressed in\na splendid English major-general's uniform, and made a very handsome\nappearance.  He remained and partook of a collation with us, at which\nseveral gentlemen were invited to meet him, and in all respects\nacquitted himself in a more polite and becoming manner than could\nhave been expected from one whose opportunities had been so limited.\nHe drank sparingly of wine, and left us at an early hour,\nnotwithstanding the solicitations of the company for him to remain.\nA few hours after he had landed, I met him again, and should hardly\nhave recognized him but for his large stature and good-natured face.\nHe had stripped himself of all his finery, and was walking over the\nplain from his house with nothing on but his marrow, and a piece of\ntappa cloth of the island thrown loosely over his shoulders.  I asked\nhim why he had taken off his uniform, to which he replied, that it\nwas too warm.\n\nOur countrymen, to vary the entertainments they were constantly\ngiving us, and thereby make them the more acceptable, proposed that\nwe should make an excursion to a valley, called by them Pearl River,\nfrom the pearl frequently found in a small stream that passes through\nit.  As horses could not be obtained for all, part of the company\nwent by water, whilst the rest, four or five, mounted on horseback.\nThe distance was about fifteen miles.  I made one of the land party,\nand we set off early in the afternoon.  There was no road, and in\nmany places not even a footpath.  The whole way was over hill and\ndale, and through swamps.  We had to jump fences and ditches made\nthrough tarrow-patches, and ascend by narrow paths, difficult and\ndangerous cliffs.  All the afternoon was occupied in this manner, and\nit was sundown when we arrived at our place of destination.  One old\nnative made bold to oppose us in jumping our horses over his fence,\nand was so obstinate in his refusal to let us pass, that for a time\nwe thought we should have to relinquish our excursion--a reflection\nnot very agreeable, after having advanced more than half way over so\nwretched a road.  Finally, when all other arguments had failed, some\none of the party, thinking that the native opposed our trespass upon\nhis premises with no other object than to lay us under contribution,\ngave him half a dollar, which did more for us than all our threats or\npersuasion.  Instead of opposing, he afterwards pointed out to us the\nbest way.  From Onavoora to Pearl River, the country was thinly\ninhabited.  We met with no considerable village or rich valley.  Our\nroad lay near the edge of a wide marsh, that intervened between us\nand the sea, in the opposite direction from which, an undulating\ncountry extended three or four miles, when it was interrupted by the\nhigh and uninhabited range of mountains that run through the centre\nof the island from one end to the other.  It was Saturday evening,\nwhen we arrived at Pearl River, and, according to the doctrine in\nwhich the missionaries had instructed the Sandwich islanders, their\nsabbath had commenced.  The hut that we were to occupy belonged to\nCaptain Dana, an American gentleman, to whom we were indebted for\nmany hours of agreeable pastime.  Besides the hut, he possessed other\nproperty in the valley, which gave him an influence with the chief of\nit, that enabled him to command whatever it produced.  When we\narrived, the chief was seated on a mat, near Captain Dana's hut,\nmoody, and, apparently, very stupid.  The arrival of so many\nstrangers, in a place where a visiter was scarcely ever seen,\nproduced a lively interest amongst the villagers.  All of them seemed\nto partake of the general excitement, but the chief, though\ncelebrated for his hospitality, was now sunk in the most listless\napathy, and apparently scarcely sensible of our presence.  When he\nwas told that we wanted supper, and preparation made for our\naccommodation on the morrow, he replied, that it was the sabbath, and\nneither then nor on the morrow could fire be made, as it was\nforbidden by the Almighty.  Upon being asked how he knew that it was\nforbidden by the Almighty, he said, that Mr. Bingham had seen the\nAlmighty, who told him so.  This was a great check to our promised\nenjoyment, and one that we were quite unprepared for, as no\nprohibition of making fire on Saturday, or any other night, was in\nexistence at Onavoora.  We saw but a poor prospect of getting supper\nor any thing, indeed, until we returned, unless we fasted on Sunday,\nand that our religious scruples did not call for, if it were not\nunavoidable.  We were unwilling, however, to interfere with the\nestablished observances, which had been thought necessary to civilize\nand improve the condition of the people, and bore our disappointment\nin silence.  After wandering about the village for a while, which was\nsmall, and scattered over a sterile ridge, we were relieved from our\nunpleasant dilemma by a native, we had taken with us as cook and\ninterpreter, who was commonly known upon the island by the name of\nJoe Banks.  He had received some education, and had been a convert to\nthe missionaries, from whom he afterwards seceded.  He did not like\nfasting any more than ourselves, and set about haranguing the chief,\nto convince him of the error of his opinion, with respect to the\nmaking of fire.  Joe was not wanting in either talent or volubility;\nand, to our great satisfaction, we soon found him on good terms with\nthe chief; a fire was made, and soon after a kid and a pig brought up\nfor slaughter.  I observed, that the chief's skin was very rough and\nin scales, resembling somewhat the shell of a small terrapin.  Upon\ninquiring the cause, they told me, it was the effect of the ava-root,\nof which he was undergoing a course.  He had almost finished the\ncourse, and his skin was all peeling off.  It was the effect of the\nava, that made him so stupid, and under its operation he was a most\ndisgusting looking object.  The natives of the Sandwich Islands are\nvery much subject to cutaneous irruptions, which are troublesome,\nand, when of long standing, often dangerous.  To eradicate this, and\nsome other offensive diseases, with which they are afflicted, they\nsometimes go through a course of the ava.  It is taken in quantities\nfrom a gill to half a pint, of the juice of the green root.  It is\nchewed, and the juice spit into a gourd, if intended for the use of\nanother person than the one who prepares it, and is said, when taken,\nto deprive the person of muscular power.  In a few moments after\nswallowing the potion, he loses the use of all his limbs.  He\nexperiences an agreeable sensation, and is conscious of every thing\nthat transpires, but without the power of speech.  He lies in this\nhelpless condition for several hours, when he recovers his strength\nin a measure, and is left in the condition of a man that has been\nvery much intoxicated.  This, to have the desired effect, is repeated\ndaily for about a month; when the disease is cured, the skin all\ncomes off, and a fair and shining one is left in its place.  When\nonce it was settled between Joe Banks and the chief of Pearl River\nValley, that fire should be made, and our supper cooked, he provided\nfor us in the most sumptuous native style.  We had pigs, goats, fish,\ntarrow, and potatoes, in the greatest profusion.  All was cooked\nafter the manner of the natives, and as the same method is practised\ngenerally amongst the islanders of the Pacific Ocean, and knowing,\nfrom experience, that it is a very good one, I will here describe it.\nA hole is first dug a foot or two deep, and large, according to the\nsize of the thing to be cooked.  A fire is then made in the hole,\nand, when it is burning well, covered over with stones of a\nconvenient size.  When every thing is in readiness, the stones being\nwell heated, they are taken off, and the hole cleared out.  A layer\nof stones is then placed all round the interior, upon which is lain\nthe meat, after being well wrapped up in green leaves.  Over this is\nplaced a thick layer of stones, which is covered with grass, or\nsomething dry, and then with earth.  If vegetables are to be cooked,\nthey are lain on the top of the upper layer of stones.  The young\ntops of the tarrow are usually wrapped up in leaves, and cooked with\nthe meats in the manner above described.  It is a very excellent\ngreen, and called by the natives lewoca, from which the method of\ncooking takes its name.  Early in the morning after our arrival, we\narose, to look upon the wild beauty of the valley, and wander through\nwhat, at a distance, appeared to be its meadows and lawns; but, to\nour great disappointment, in descending from the hills, the green\nlevel fields that looked so pleasant at a distance, were all cut up\nin tarrow patches, flooded over, and intersected in every direction\nwith ditches and embankments.  A scene, so uninviting, soon induced\nus to relinquish our anticipated pleasure, and return.\n\nIn the course of our morning's walk we came to the house of an\nEnglishman, who, a few years previous, arrived at the island in a\nPeruvian man-of-war, the seamen of which had risen upon their\nofficers, and ran away with the vessel.  He had taken to himself a\nnative wife, and, to all appearance, had fixed here his abode for\nlife.  His hut looked extremely comfortable--not less so, indeed,\nthan that of the chief, and besides other property that he had\nacquired, he had a fine flock of sheep feeding near his residence.\nHe politely invited us into his house, which we declined, as we were\nreturning late to breakfast.\n\nAfter breakfast we set off in our boat to visit a small island near\nthe sea shore, where there were a great many rabbits.  We passed\nalong several miles of an inlet of the sea, before we came to it.  It\nwas half a mile long, level, and overgrown with high weeds.  The\nrabbits were so numerous, that the island was every where perforated\nwith their burrows, and one or more would be found in almost every\nbunch of high grass that we came to,--so tame, that we could\nfrequently take them up in our hands.  We caught more than a dozen of\nthem in this way, in the short time that we remained.  Some years\nprevious, an old Spaniard, by the name of Menini, who had settled at\nOnavoora, put one or more pairs of rabbits upon this small island,\nand prevailed upon the chiefs to tabboo them.  From that time they\nhad not been disturbed.\n\nAfter returning to our dinner, we all set off on our way back to\nOnuvoora.  To vary the scene, I relinquished my horse and took\npassage in the boat.  We sailed for several miles among marshes and\nbarren islands, upon a salt water inlet, up which a ship of heavy\nburthen might pass for a considerable distance.  The whole way was\nquite void of interest.  When we got to the sea, we had a head wind\nto row against all the way.  A reef extended out from the shore,\nbeyond which we were compelled to go, making the distance so great,\nthat the evening was far advanced before we got to the Dolphin.\n\nNot long after our return from Pearl River, I set out one day with an\nAmerican gentleman, to ascend a high and steep mountain, that rises\nback of the village, which the natives, many years ago, fortified\nwith a few heavy pieces of cannon.  We crossed the plain, which is a\nmile or a mile and a half wide, when we came to the base of the\nmountain.  It was seven or eight hundred feet high, and from below,\nseemed to rise almost perpendicular from the plain.  A winding\nfootpath, however, showed us that it had long and frequently been\nascended by the natives, and encouraged us to make the attempt.  We\nhad often to stop and get breath, but at last accomplished our\nobject, by gaining the summit and entering upon a small plain.  Here\nwe found several huts, that were occupied by the families of the men\nappointed to guard this important post, into which we entered to\nobtain leave to examine the fortification.  The people were very\nfriendly; they not only granted us permission, but hospitably\nproffered us some excellent melons, which were very refreshing after\nour laborious ascent.  There were only three men in the fort, one of\nwhom, that appeared to have the command, politely waited upon us in\nour walk round.  The guns were mounted on a platform, at the very\nedge of the precipice that overlooked the harbour and town.  They\nwere of thirty-two pound caliber.  It must have been a work of\ninconceivable labour for the natives to get them upon this great\neminence.  The carriages and all their fixtures were very much\ndecayed, and totally unfit for use.  The situation is very\ncommanding, and notwithstanding the distance, the battery would be\nformidable to an enemy in the harbour.  From this eminence, we had an\nextensive and beautiful prospect, comprehending the valley and\nharbour, many miles at sea, and along the sea-coast in either\ndirection.  The river, that waters the valley, broken in cataracts as\nit rapidly descended to the sea, showed to its greatest advantage,\nand the valley, covered with its tarrow patches, corn, and potatoes,\npresented a landscape resembling finely cultivated fields and waving\ngreen meadows.  In front, was the thatched village of Onavoora, the\nhuts looking like heaps of dry straw; beyond it, the harbour and\nshipping; and still farther, at sea, a long range of white foaming\nbreakers.  On the extreme right, was the valley of Pearl River,\nbounded by high and rugged mountains; and to the left, the cocoa-nut\ngroves of Whytete and Diamond Rock, with its adjacent sterile hills,\ncovered with volcanic cinders.\n\nFrom the top of the hill, we descended in a different direction on\nour return, with a view of passing through a part of the valley that\nruns far back from the shore between the mountains, where it appeared\nto be finely cultivated and well inhabited.  We had not gone far from\nthe fort, when we found ourselves near the centre of what had been\nthe crater of a volcano, and which, from its resemblance, has given\nthe eminence the name of the Punch Bowl, by which it is familiarly\nknown amongst foreigners.  The crater is about a quarter or half a\nmile in diameter, and from one to two hundred feet deep.  When we\ndescended to the valley, which was not without difficulty, our way\nwas every where interrupted by tarrow patches, their ditches, and\nembankments.  After crossing a small valley, we came to an elevated\npiece of ground, where the natives who cultivated the tarrow below,\nhad built their habitations, and around them planted groves of\nBanana.  It was a fine morning, and the people of both sexes were\nindustriously engaged in their appropriate occupations.  Some of the\nwomen were roasting tarrow, and others making it up in poye.  The\nlatter operation was interesting to me, as I had never seen it\nbefore.  When the tarrow is roasted, and the skin taken off, it\nresembles a potatoe; it is then put into a tray, and with a long,\nsmooth stone, beaten up as fine as possible, occasionally mixing a\nsmall quantity of water with it; after it has been beaten in this\nway, it is worked over a number of times, to get all the lumps out;\nit then has the appearance of a thick paste or starch.  A soon as it\nfoments a little and becomes slightly acid, it is used.  When in this\nstate, it will not last long before it becomes very sour, and is then\nconsidered so unwholesome, that unless the people are very poor, it\nis thrown away.\n\nAfter satisfying our curiosity in seeing the women make poye, we\ndescended the hill where several men were preparing a tarrow patch.\nIt was forty feet square, excavated a little, and an embankment two\nfeet high thrown up all around it, descending with a considerable\nangle from the top to the base, making it very broad at the bottom.\nThe labourers had advanced thus far, and were beating the area and\ninner sides of the embankment with broad heavy paddles, going over it\na great many times.  It appeared very hard and firm when we saw them\nat work; but still, they told us, that they had to beat it a great\ndeal more.  When this is completed, the tops of the tarrow that have\nbeen cut off for the purpose, are set in the ground and lightly\nflooded with water; after it has taken root and began to grow\nthriftily, more water is let in upon it; the tarrow well grown, will\ngenerally be covered with water to the depth of one or two feet.  It\nis about the size of a beet, and takes a year or more to come to its\ngreatest perfection.  It has clusters of broad bright green leaves,\nthat in shape and appearance are a good deal like the common pond\nlilly.  It is a very nutricious vegetable, and constitutes the\nprincipal means of subsistence of the Sandwich Islanders.\n\nThe huts of the natives were very small, and although in the midst of\ncultivation and fertility, the inhabitants seemed to be wretchedly\npoor.  They did not appear much more civilized than the natives of\nthe Marquesas; their habitations were certainly less comfortable.\nReturning to the village, we saw a number of people scraping sticks\nthat looked like our elder, and preserving the inner bark.  Upon\ninquiring its use, they told us it was to catch fish with.  When\neaten by the fish, they come to the top of the water and are taken\nout by hand.  It is said, the fish are not the worse for this.\n\nOn our arrival at Oahoo, the Dolphin was out of repair in every\nrespect, and it was indispensably necessary to refit her, before we\nproceeded further on our return to the coast of Chili or Peru.\nWhilst the masts were out, and the vessel was undergoing general\nrepairs, the captain received a letter from Captain Edwards, of the\nship Loudon, of New-York, stating that he had ran upon a reef, on the\nIsland of Ranai; besides a valuable cargo, he had a large amount of\nspecie and bullion on board.  The chief Thunder, (chief of Ranai,)\nwas encouraging the natives of the island to plunder him, and\nfinally, that his life and treasure was in the greatest jeopardy.\nAlthough not incumbent upon him as a duty, Captain Percival, with a\npromptitude highly creditable to himself and the service to which he\nbelonged, chartered a vessel, and with the crew of the Dolphin, and\nBoque, the Governor of Oahoo, sailed on the same day that he received\nthe letter.  He found the situation of Captain Edwards not less\ncritical than he had described it to be.  The natives had already\nplundered him of a part of his cargo, and his own crew was in a state\nof mutiny.  Employing the authority of Chief Boque, and the\nindefatigable industry of his own crew, Captain Percival caused the\nstolen goods to be restored, and the cargo and treasure of the Loudon\nto be safely landed at Oahoo.  When all this had been accomplished,\nCaptain Edwards refused to pay the charter of the vessel that was\nemployed for his relief, in consequence of which, a quarrel arose\nbetween himself and Captain Percival, that eventuated in consequences\ninjurious and disagreeable to both parties, and after our return\nhome, became a subject of judicial investigation.  By this\ninvestigation, which was brought on at the instance of Captain\nEdwards, an opportunity was afforded to Captain Percival and the\nofficers of the Dolphin, to vindicate their characters, which they\ndid, in every instance, to the entire satisfaction of their\ngovernment and countrymen.\n\nWhilst Captain Percival was absent at Ranai, Captain Jackson, of the\nbrig Harbinger, of Boston, addressed a letter to me, stating that his\nstore in the village had been broken open, and robbed of goods to a\nlarge amount, and requesting my assistance to recover them.  The\nmatter was laid before the chief, Crimacu, who instituted a search,\nand on the following day, sent for Captain Jackson.  At his hut, were\nassembled most of the foreigners of any respectability on the island,\nand many of the natives to witness the result of the inquiry.  Some\nof the thieves had already been detected, and now stood before the\nchief, who, although very ill, sat up to question them about the\nrobbery.  They confessed their guilt, and in answering the questions\nput to them, convicted others, who were sent for and brought in,\nuntil the number amounted to six.  They had shared their booty, and\nwere sent out, with guards, to bring it from their different places\nof concealment.  It consisted, principally, of fine calicoes and\ncloths, which had been put in tarrow patches, and oil casks, and when\nreturned, were so damaged, as to be of but little value to the owner.\nWhen the chief got through with the inquiry, and had collected all\nthe goods that could be found, he asked Mr. Jackson what punishment\nhe would have inflicted upon the offenders.  Mr. Jackson's reply was,\nthat he wanted restitution made for the loss he had sustained, and\nthat he would leave the punishment to the chief, according to the\nusage of the islands.  The chief contended that the men were all\npoor, and had nothing wherewith to pay.  He said that the chiefs were\nalso poor, and denied the justice of compelling them, under any\ncircumstances, to pay for the thefts of the people.  He offered to\nput the culprits at Captain Jackson's disposal, or inflict upon them\nwhatever punishment he should prescribe, according to the laws of his\nown country.  Captain Jackson refused to say what punishment the men\nshould receive, and only contended that the chief was bound to see\nhis property, or an equivalent, restored to him.  The matter was, for\nsome hours in debate, when the chief compromised with Captain\nJackson, by promising to have a quantity of sandal-wood collected for\nhim within a prescribed period.  The thieves were set at liberty\nwithout punishment, in consequence of which, it was surmised by some\nof our countrymen, that the chiefs had been concerned in the theft.\nThis, I thought, a very unjust suspicion, as the investigation took\nplace so publicly, that the fact, if it had been so, could hardly\nhave failed to appear in the course of the inquiry.\n\nThe magnanimity of Crimacu,[14] in promising an equivalent for the\ndamaged goods, which he was not bound to do by the customs of the\nSandwich Islands, or the laws of civilized communities, gave me the\nhighest opinion of his character.  It appeared to me that he first\nobjected to remunerate the merchant for his loss, with no other\nmotive than to produce discussion, from which he might learn what\nwould be done in more enlightened countries, in a similar case.  He\nwas told of the different punishments that the culprits would be\nsubject to under the laws of America and England, but nothing could\nbe advanced, even supposing that he was to act in accordance with the\nlaws of those countries, to prove that the chiefs or king of the\nislands, were in any other way responsible for the thefts committed\nby individuals, than to make them stand forth and suffer in person\nfor their offences.  He remarked, that the information he received\nfrom individuals of the same country, with respect to their laws and\ncustoms, was often at variance, and so contradictory, that he was\nfrequently at a loss to know what he should do to answer the ends of\njustice, and give satisfaction to the strangers who came to the\nislands.  He declared, that the chiefs of the Sandwich Islands,\nwished to do like other people.\n\nAmongst those with whom we held frequent and friendly intercourse,\nwas an Englishman, by the name of Wilkinson, who had taken passage to\nthe Sandwich Islands, in the Frigate Blonde, when she went there with\nthe remains of king Rio Rio, and who had banished himself from his\nown country to this distant region, with a view of becoming a planter\nof the Sandwich Islands.  He had been, according to his own\nstatement, a planter in the West Indies in early life, and\nsubsequently on his return to England, joined a troop of horse, of\nwhich he was a captain, destined for Spain, during the war in the\nPeninsula, where he served for a considerable time, but at the close\nof the war, having left the army, and met with a reverse of fortune,\nhe had determined to make the experiment in which he was now engaged.\nA bold one, it must be confessed, for a man, at the age of\nforty-five, and with an enfeebled constitution.  Aided by Captain\nByron, (who, from his high rank, and the flattering mission upon\nwhich he had been sent, was well prepared to assist him,) Mr.\nWilkinson obtained from the chiefs the first deed that ever was\ngranted by them, for two hundred acres of land.  It was situated\nabout six miles from Onavoora, on elevated ground, bordering upon a\nnarrow valley that winds through the mountains for several miles back\nfrom the sea.  The chiefs granted the deed with great reluctance,\nnotwithstanding the respectable source from which the petition came,\nbeing extremely tenacious of that command and sovereignty of the\nsoil, that enables them, at pleasure, to dispossess the occupant.\nThey the more willingly relinquished the spot that Mr. Wilkinson had\nfixed upon for his residence, as it was situated upon land so high,\nthat it could not be used for the culture of tarrow, and was at the\ntime unoccupied.  With uncommon industry, although cramped by the\nwant of money, that would have given it its full effect, he had\nreclaimed from a wild state, about fifty acres of land, which, when\nwe arrived there, was planted with sugar-cane, corn, potatoes,\nbananas, &c., thus providing for his immediate wants, whilst the cane\npromised a rich harvest, that would amply reward him for his toil,\nwhenever he could complete his machinery for the manufacture of\nsugar.  In this, however, to all appearance when we were there, he\nwould encounter great difficulty, as materials were not easily\nobtained; and although there were some mechanics on the island, their\nconstant employment in the village, where they could frequently see\ntheir countrymen, and withal, their fondness for pleasure was likely\nto deprive him for a long time of their useful services, without\nwhich, he could do nothing.  Connected with his land, was a stream of\nwater running from the mountains, that would answer his purpose for\nmanufacturing sugar.  In a part of it that possessed all local\nadvantages, he had made a dam and collected part of the materials for\na mill, to be constructed in the simplest manner, but which, for the\nwant of mechanical aid, lay in almost the same rude state in which he\nhad purchased them.  He anticipated, however, with great confidence,\nthat by the time the cane was ready for cutting, the mill would be\nprepared, when the hopes by which he had first been stimulated, could\nscarcely fail to be realized.  The sugar cane grows wild upon the\nSandwich Islands, and Mr. Wilkinson's fields were from the native\ngrowth, which he had planted in prepared land, and at our departure,\nthe canes were upwards of six feet high.\n\nAlthough several strangers, familiar with the arts of civilized\ncountries, have settled and lived, for many years, amongst the\nSandwich Islanders, Mr. Wilkinson was the first individual who ever\nattempted to put them in practice, upon a scale, sufficiently\nextensive to improve, materially, the agricultural condition of the\nislands, and thereby prove to the inhabitants the wealth they\npossess, in a rich soil, and one of the finest climates on the face\nof the globe.  Should Mr. Wilkinson be successful, the result of his\nexperiment will probably do more towards the civilization of the\nnatives, and their ultimate advancement in knowledge and lasting\nprosperity, than has yet been effected by all the white men that have\nlived amongst them.  This, I am aware, will be considered a rash\nassertion by the good people of our country, who, from the best of\nmotives, feel deeply engaged in foreign missions, and, in expressing\nthis opinion, I will also bear testimony to the useful services of\nthe missionaries.  From the best information that I could obtain upon\nthe subject, I am satisfied, that they have improved the morals of\nthe people, and if they devote themselves to the schools that they\nhave established, and to introducing the arts of life and\ncivilization, the time may not be distant, when the natives will be\nprepared to receive Christianity.  But in their present condition,\nwould it not be better, and more in the true spirit of that\nbenevolence and philanthropy which is inspired by our religion, to\nteach them how to cultivate their land, to introduce grain and\nfruits, congenial to the climate, and to plant and reap as we do,\nrather than imbue their minds with a mysterious doctrine, which,\nbeing beyond their comprehension, must resolve itself into a dark and\nintolerant superstition.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands, are mild, amiable, and\nintelligent, and susceptible of the highest degree of moral and\nintellectual improvement.  As a people, it may be said, that the\nstamp of civilization is scarcely perceptible yet upon them; and it\nis now inevitable, that they must bear the impress of those, whom our\nphilanthropists have sent to convert them to Christianity; and,\nwhether they become ignorant zealots, or intelligent Christians, will\ndepend upon their teachers.  The situation of these missionaries is,\ntherefore, one of high responsibility, and ought not, in Christian\ncharity, to be occupied by the narrow-minded fanatic, or the ignorant\nzealot.  It is of the first importance that they, who dispose of the\nvast means of the missionary society, should select only such men for\ncivilizing and Christianizing the Sandwich Islanders, as are\ndistinguished for their knowledge, and love of the useful arts of\nlife, as well as for practical piety.\n\nThe harbour of Onavoora, is a place of general rendezvous for the\nwhale ships, cruising on the coast of Japan, and in the vicinity of\nthe islands.  The months of January, February, and March, being the\nleast favourable for their business, they then leave their cruising\nground, and go in search of refreshment.  No place is so convenient\nfor them as the Sandwich Islands, and the port of Onavoora, being the\nmost commodious of any in the group, and affording an abundant supply\nof vegetables, hogs, &c.,--they all congregate there in the months\nabove mentioned.\n\nThe average number that visit the island in the course of the year,\nis upwards of fifty.  More than twenty were there together, at\nseveral different periods of our stay, some of which remained a few\ndays, some weeks, and a few one or two months, according to their\nseveral necessities.  At such times the seamen, from having been long\nconfined to the narrow precinct of their vessels, become very\ninsubordinate, and frequently give way to the most licentious\nindulgences of their passions, regardless of every obligation of\nobedience due to their officers.  We witnessed frequent instances of\nthis kind, and had the satisfaction of being constantly useful to the\ncaptains of ships, and the whaling interest, by restraining the\nviolent, and coercing them to a proper sense of duty.\n\nA most unpleasant occurrence took place about six weeks after our\narrival at Onavoora, arising from this disposition of the seamen, and\nother causes, which was afterwards greatly misrepresented in this\ncountry.  Some of the seamen of the Dolphin, who were on liberty, got\ninto a frolic, and, associating themselves with many others belonging\nto the whale ships, determined to go to the houses of the high chiefs\nand missionaries, and demand the repeal of a restriction that\ndeprived them of the society of females.  They produced a riot that\ngave rise to a considerable degree of excitement for a few minutes;\nbut Captain Percival, with some of the officers of the Dolphin, and\ncaptains of whale-ships, promptly suppressed it, and prevented any\nserious outrage.  It was afterwards unjustly and most ungenerously\nascribed to the officers of the Dolphin.\n\nThe white population of Onavoora is of a varied character, from the\nagent of our North West traders, to the most abandoned members of\nsociety.  There are from fifty to a hundred, permanently settled at\nOnavoora; the least respectable of whom, maintain themselves by\nkeeping tippling shops Tor sailors, and practising such chicaneries\nas are suggested by opportunities and the absence of law.  The season\nfor the whalers to visit the Island is the time of their harvest,\nwhen, besides their gains from entertaining the seamen, they\nfrequently prevail upon them to desert for the sake of the reward for\ntheir apprehension, or to strip them of what little money or clothes\nthey may be possessed of.  Some of them have married women of the\nIsland, and live much in the same way as the natives.  Of all the\npermanent settlers at Onavoora, the most remarkable was a Spaniard by\nthe name of Meninne, who had been in the Islands upwards of thirty\nyears.  Of his manner of getting there, a variety of stories were\ntold.  His own account was, that being invited on board of a vessel\nthat visited the coast of California, he fell asleep in the evening,\nand, when he awoke, found himself at sea, and the vessel running,\nwith a fair wind, for the Sandwich Islands.  All his entreaties to be\nreturned to land were in vain, and he arrived at Owhyhee, where, poor\nand friendless, he was landed amongst the natives.  He wandered from\nisland to island, in a forlorn and wretched condition, until he was\ntaken under the patronage of Tamahamaha.  For a long time, he\nfollowed the fortunes of the native warrior, and at length fixed his\nresidence at Oahoo, from whence he occasionally embarked as\ninterpreter on board of merchant vessels, bound on smuggling voyages\nto the coast of America.  After passing through a variety of fortune,\nbeing several times made prisoner and threatened with death, he\nfinally quitted his vagrant life, and remained permanently at Oahoo,\nwhere, by great industry and economy, he has acquired an amount of\nproperty which, for that place, is a princely fortune.  Besides\nhaving money in the United States and England, he owns nearly all the\ncattle on the Island of Oahoo, a number of horses, flocks of goats,\nsheep, &c.  He has extensive possessions in land, which he holds from\nthe chiefs in consideration of his services, and a great many houses.\nHe has taken some pains to introduce exotics in the Islands, and\nbesides the lemon, orange, and other valuable fruits, has a vineyard\nfrom which he makes a considerable quantity of wine annually.  He is\nsaid to be extremely selfish, and so jealous of preserving to himself\na monopoly of these valuable fruits, that he has been accused of\ndestroying the young plants of others.  He is considered as ranking\namongst the chiefs in the enjoyment of certain privileges; and,\nspeaking the language of the Islands well, is called upon as\ninterpreter for the government upon all important occasions.  He has\nhad thirty-seven children by various wives, and is yet in the prime\nof life.  Like most men who have felt the cold hand of poverty, and\nafterwards acquired wealth, he is extremely penurious, and thinks of\nnothing so much as adding to his fortune without knowing how to enjoy\nit.\n\nOn the 3d of April, the young king and all the high chiefs, were\ninvited on board to spend the day with us.  In the morning, we\ndressed the schooner in all the flags we could muster, and made the\nbest preparation our limited accommodation would admit of to receive\nour distinguished guests.  No indication of their appearance was seen\nfor some time after every thing was in readiness, and our boats on\nshore in waiting, and we were kept in suspense until we had almost\ndespaired of seeing them.  All at once the whole town was in an\nuproar, and the people were running and hallooing in every direction.\nThe young king in advance, walked arm in arm with one of the officers\nof the Dolphin.  Next came Boque and his spouse, with other high\ndignitaries, and in the rear a multitude of people of both sexes and\nall ages.  When they had embarked, the eyes of the people were turned\nupon another object, not less interesting to them than the king.\nCrimacu, or Billy Pitt, too ill to walk, was gravely making his way\nto the beach in a hand cart, where he got into a boat and came on\nboard soon after the king.  We received them with manned yards, and a\nsalute of twenty-one guns.  The king, who was a boy of ten or twelve\nyears old, was dressed in a military uniform that was sent to him\nfrom the king of England, and upon his shoulders he wore a pair of\ngolden epaulets, with crowns on them.  He appeared to be sensible of\nhis rank, and, upon two or three occasions, addressed his attendants\nin a way that indicated a wish to make a display of his authority.\nThe chiefs conducted themselves towards him with a becoming respect,\nbut without bestowing upon him any attention that might interfere\nwith their own enjoyment or convenience.  Instead of partaking of\nwhat we had provided for our guests, they, with one or two\nexceptions, unceremoniously uncovered their poye pots, which had been\nbrought with them by an attendant, and ate heartily of their\nfavourite food, using their fingers as is the native custom.  Boque\nagain displayed his major general's uniform, and was amongst the most\npolished of our guests.  After passing a number of hours on board,\nthey returned to the shore delighted with their visit.  The same\ncompliment was paid them as at their reception.  It was a day of\ngreat enjoyment with the common people.  They received their chiefs\non landing with loud huzzas, and followed them in crowds to their\nrespective habitations.\n\nWe passed all the winter months at Onavoora, during which we had\nfrequent heavy rains.  Some of the storms were attended with violent\ngales, and disagreeably cold weather.  About the 3d of May, an\ninfluenza made its appearance amongst the inhabitants of Oahoo, and\nin two days not a well native was any where to be seen.  The market,\nfrom being well attended, was deserted.  In a week, the distress was\nso general and so great, that it was feared the poor people would\nperish with hunger.  I visited several families, not a member of\nwhich was able to help himself or others, and all were totally\ndestitute of food.  A great many of the people died, and amongst the\nrest two chiefs, one of whom was George Tamauri, a native of the\nIsland of Atooi, who was educated in this country.  The other was\nCahaliha, next in affinity to the king.  Scarcely any of the white\npeople were affected.  Not even those living on shore.  In about ten\ndays, the people from the country began to make their appearance in\nthe market, the distress was greatly alleviated, and soon afterwards\nthe general good health restored.  At such times of suffering, the\ncondition of these people is truly wretched.  They have no floor to\ntheir huts but the hard-beaten ground from which their naked bodies\nare separated only by two or three thin mats, and during the rainy\nseason the earth becomes perfectly saturated with water.  Their huts\nare generally built in a very frail manner, and in a driving storm\nare not proof against the rain.  This, alone, is sufficient to\naccount for the thinly populated state of the islands, without\ncharging the natives with the acts of inhumanity that have been\nascribed to them by some people.\n\nThe harbour of Onavoora is formed by coral reefs, that extend upwards\nof a mile from the shore.  The entrance to it is narrow and somewhat\ndifficult.  It affords water enough for a sloop of war.  A pilot in\nand out of the harbour, is always employed.  It is very secure, being\nquite land locked.  The holding ground is good, and vessels may lay\nin safety close along side of the beach.  The water is perfectly\nsmooth in good weather, and the bottom and shores being nearly every\nwhere of soft mud, a vessel might be driven upon them in a gale\nwithout sustaining any material injury.  The visits of the numerous\nwhale ships has made Onavoora a place of considerable trade.  All of\nthem spend more or less money for their necessary refreshments, and\nwhen out of repair, their disbursements are frequently very\nconsiderable.  For the supplies afforded by the natives, thousands of\ndollars are annually received by them, which they give in return for\nsilk, cotton, calicoes, cloth, &c.  Two or three stores, well stocked\nwith a great variety of goods, are supported in Onavoora by this\ninterchange of commodities; and, from the way in which the trade is\nconducted, there is but little doubt that the proprietors are\nrewarded with handsome profits.  The sandal wood has become scarce\nupon the islands, from the large quantities formerly taken away by\nour traders, and does not now form a very lucrative or extensive\narticle of commerce.  Upon this article, some of our merchants are\nsaid to have made large sums of money in exchange for whole cargoes\nof goods, with the chiefs of the Sandwich Islands.  It is related of\nTamahamaha, that, after making a purchase of this kind, which he paid\nfor in ship loads of sandal wood, brought from the mountains with\ngreat labour to himself and people, he has been known to load a\nnumber of canoes secretly at night, with fine broadcloths, and take\nthem out to sea, where he sunk them with stones.  His only reason for\nit was, that the possession of them would make his chiefs and people\ntoo luxurious and idle, and bringing sandal wood from the mountains\nto pay for more, would give them employment.  A doubtful policy,\ncertainly, if the statement be true.  Be this as it may, himself and\nsuccessor have entailed upon their descendants a national debt of\nseveral hundred thousands of dollars, now due to our merchants, which\nthey will not soon be able to liquidate.\n\nOn the 11th of May, after long anticipating our much wished for\ndeparture, we got underway, and saluting the fort as we passed it\nwith twenty-one guns, stood out to sea and shaped our course for\nChili.  Nothing material transpired from the time of our sailing\nuntil the 7th of June, when standing along with a fresh trade, and\nthe night dark and squally, at 10 P.M., the lookout-ahead reported\nland close aboard.  We tacked and lay to for the night, to survey our\nnewly discovered island on the following morning.  At daylight, it\nbore S.S.W., about six miles from us, and appeared in three small\nhummocs, covered thickly with trees and bushes, every where bounded\nby a coral reef and heavy surf.  We hesitated for some time whether\nwe should land, apprehending that it would be attended with too much\nrisk, merely for the gratification of curiosity; but this feeling\noperated so powerfully upon us, that there was no resisting the\ndesire to land where no one had ever been before.  Accordingly, two\nboats were sent off, and watching a favourable opportunity passed\nthrough the surf in safety, and landed on the coral bank where they\nwere left high and dry by the receding wave.  It was on the lee side\nof the island, and a coral reef stretched off about fifty or a\nhundred yards from the shore, full of holes, and almost dry at low\nwater.  In the holes we sought for fish, as at Caroline Island, but\nfound very few.  On traversing the island, we could find no fruit or\nvegetable of any description except bup.  In most places it was\ncovered with trees and bushes of a thick growth, almost impenetrable.\nIn the bushes we found a great many tropical birds setting, so tame\nthat we could take them off of their nests with our hands, and in\ngetting upon the weather side of the island where there was a clear\nspace, we found a species of small gull, so numerous, that when they\nrose from the ground at our approach, they appeared to form almost a\ncompact mass.  The sand was literally covered with their eggs, which,\nupon examination, proved to be unfit for use, with few exceptions.\nThe birds flew and hovered so near to us that we caught several of\nthem with our hands.  After amusing ourselves a little while with the\nnovel spectacle of such numbers of birds so very tame, we collected\nall the old eggs within a small space, and in less than twenty\nminutes after it had been thus cleared, it was again covered with\nfresh eggs by the birds that were constantly lighting.  We might, in\na few hours, have loaded our boats with them.  When we returned to\nour boats to go on board, the tide had risen, and with it the surf\nhad increased to an alarming degree.  At first, we held a\nconsultation whether we should attempt to pass through it or remain\nuntil it should again subside with the falling of the tide; but the\nday was far advanced, and the appearance of the weather such, as in\nall probability would render our situation extremely painful, there\nbeing every prospect of an increase of wind.  We therefore determined\nto put our fortune to the test, and were not a little discouraged\nwhen on one of the boats attempting the surf was thrown back by the\nsecond roller that she encountered with the utmost violence,\nupsetting her, and scattering the people in different directions,\nsome of them escaping with their lives with the greatest difficulty.\nNotwithstanding the ill success of our first attempt, we determined\non a second, rather than risk the consequences of longer delay.\nEmbracing a favourable opportunity where the surf appeared least\nviolent, we put off, and passed through it in safety without further\naccident.\n\nThe island was little more than a mile long, and from a hundred yards\nto a quarter of a mile wide.  It was every where very low.  By a\nmeridian observation, we placed the north-west end of it in latitude\nsouth 21 degrees 48 minutes, and longitude by chronometer 154 degrees\n54 minutes west.  In compliment to the commander of our squadron in\nthe Pacific Ocean, we called it Hull's Island.  It may be\ncomprehended within the group of Society Islands.\n\nIn the afternoon, June the 4th, we made sail; and on the following\nday at half-past 6 o'clock, A.M. discovered the island of Ramitaria,\non the lee bow, about eight leagues from us.  This island was not\nlaid down in any of our charts, having been discovered only three or\nfour years before; but we had seen a gentlemen who had stopped there,\nand it was included in our list of islands.  On approaching it we\nwere pleased to find that it differed from many of the islands we had\nvisited, being of a moderate elevation.  It is about three miles long\nand one or two wide.  We ran nearly round it before we found a place\nto land, the surf breaking high every where, and the shores bounded\nby large rocks of coral.  At last, we came to the principal\nsettlement, which was situated close to the shore, where a large\nwhite-washed house indicated the former visits and influences of the\nmissionaries.  The people, to the number of one or two hundred, were\nassembled on the beach inviting us to land.  Here, also, was a\nconsiderable surf and some coral rocks, which made the landing not\naltogether free from difficulty.  When the boat came near the shore\nand while she was yet shooting rapidly through the surf, the natives,\nwho had already advanced to meet us, laid hold as many as could get\nround her, and with loud shouting, carried us high upon the beach.\nAt this somewhat unexpected reception, the boat's crew instinctively\nseized their pistols, thinking at first, that the natives were\nhostile in their disposition towards us.  It was but a momentery\npanic which passed away with the kind salutations we immediately\nafterwards received.  When I enquired for the chief, a young man was\npointed out to me in the crowd, distinguished from the rest by an old\nhat on his head, that he had obtained from some former visiter.  He\nseemed not to be treated with the least respect by the people, who\njostled him in the crowd with the most perfect carelessness.\nScarcely had I addressed him, when a stout native came up with an air\nof some importance, and saluting me, told me in the language of the\nSociety Islands, that he was the missionary.  Upon his approach, the\nchief immediately shrunk back into the crowd.  He called to him a\nMalay, who was not far off, and bade him ask what we wanted.  The\nMalay, whose name was Manoo, spoke English very well, which was a\nsource of great satisfaction to us, as we could thereby communicate\nour wants freely, and it introduced us at once to each others'\nacquaintance.  I explained to Manoo that we were in want of water and\nsuch refreshments as the island might afford.  He immediately\nproceeded in company with the missionary to show me where water was\nto be obtained.  We passed through a forest of very large trees over\na plain that extended more than half a mile, when we came to a marsh\nof reeds and rank grass, where there was from one to two feet of\nwater, covering an area of two or three acres.  This would not answer\nour purpose as the water was not very good, and its distance from the\nplace of embarkation rendered it too laborious an undertaking to\nwater the vessel from it.  When I had remarked this to Manoo and the\nmissionary, they replied that there was better water, but it was\nstill more distant.  I suffered them to conduct me to it, and we took\na footpath over rising ground, and through another delightful forest\nof bread-fruit and other wide-spreading trees, passing many fine\ntarrow patches, and at the distance of half a mile from the marsh, we\ncame to a spring of excellent water.  Manoo and the missionary both\nexpressed a great deal of disappointment when I spoke in terms of\ndisapprobation of this also as a watering-place--it being altogether\ntoo far from the shore.  On our return from the spring, we took a\ndifferent footpath from that by which we came, and ascended to a more\nelevated part of the island to see the work of the missionary, as it\nwas called by Manoo.  This consisted of two or three enclosures by\nmeans of stakes, in the midst of the forest, where the trees had been\ncut down for several acres, which was cleared and planted with sweet\npotatoes and tobacco.  The enclosures were made, and all the labour\nof clearing the forest was done, as Manoo remarked, by such of the\nwicked and disobedient, as had resisted the authority and ordinances\nof the white missionary during his residence on the island some\nmonths previous.  Since then, the white missionary had returned to\nOtaheite, and sent this native missionary, who belonged to that\nisland, to represent him in his absence.  Leaving the enclosures of\ntobacco and sweet potatoes, we came into a thicket where the trees\nwere overrun with the vines of the yam, growing wild and covered with\nbeautiful blue flowers that gave a picturesque appearance to the\nforest, and filled it with their fragrance.  We passed five or six\nstone columns that had been sixty or seventy feet high, and twenty or\nthirty in circumference.  They were in a dilapidated state, having in\npart been thrown down by order of the missionaries.  Manoo told me\nthat they were monuments erected in honour of the Indian god.\nSeveral of these ruins were standing by the side of an old\nburial-place in the edge of the woods near the shore.  Each of the\ngraves were neatly enclosed with a wall of stone.  When we returned\nto the village, I was taken to a large frame building called the\nmissionary house, where the missionary had prepared a roasted pig and\nsome tarrow, for our dinner.  He designed to entertain me after the\nmanner of the whites, and with this view, had placed our repast on a\nlarge coarse table that stood in the middle of the room with benches\nround it.  When we were seated, he unlocked a chest and took from it\na plate for each of us, and a knife and fork, all of which were\nextremely dirty, and the knives and forks quite covered with rust.\nThis, however, he did not seem to remark, although he evidently\nwished me to think that he knew how to be polite, after the fashion\nof my country people.  He acquitted himself pretty well, to his own\nsatisfaction, until he attempted to use the knife and fork--but that\nwas altogether too much for him.  After making several trials in vain\nto cut his meat, he asked me to assist him; and finally, before he\nhad half finished his dinner, laid down his clumsy instruments and\nused his fingers.  The chief, and as many of the natives as could get\ninto the room came round us, but none of them were invited to partake\nwith the missionary and myself, except Manoo, whilst the hungry crowd\nstood looking wistfully at us.\n\nSoon after we had finished our dinner, the captain and several of the\nofficers landed, and we exchanged several articles with the natives\nfor their pigs, yams, &c.  The following day was their Sabbath and\nour Saturday, and they insisted that we should remain until Monday,\nbefore any exchange of commodities took place.  When, however, we\ndeclared our determination to depart that evening, they began\ncollecting whatever might be acceptable to us.  Hogs of various\nsizes, were brought to the beach in great numbers.  Needles,\njack-knives, and old clothes, were our articles of traffic, than\nwhich we could have offered them nothing more valuable.  By sundown,\nwe had collected from thirty to forty hogs, and a good supply of\nyams.  In a few hours more, we might have obtained twice as many upon\nthe same terms.\n\nTowards the close of the day, when the missionary felt assured that\nit was our determination to depart, he asked if I was a doctor, or\nhad any skill in medicine; and, although I replied in the negative,\ninsisted upon my going to his house to see, and prescribe for his\nwife, who, he told me, was extremely ill.  Upon entering his hut, we\nfound her laying on a mat on the floor; and notwithstanding the\nweather was oppressively warm, she was covered over with a great many\npieces of the tappa cloth, head and all, and perspiring most\nprofusely.  The missionary, with great gravity, but most\nunceremoniously, removed all the covering, and pointed out to me her\ninfirmity, which was nothing more than a common bile, with which she\nseemed to be suffering considerable pain.  I declined prescribing,\nalthough repeatedly requested to do so; and at sun-down, we embarked\nand made sail.  Had it been convenient for us to remain two days\nlonger at Ramitarias, we could have obtained an abundant supply of\nwhatever the island produced, for a very trifling consideration; but\nalthough there was anchorage, it was unsheltered, and too near the\nshore for us to ride in safety.\n\nAt six, P.M. on the 10th of June, we took our departure from\nRamitarias; and at day-light, on the 13th, made the Island of\nToubouai, bearing to the northward and eastward, about eight leagues\nfrom us.  In getting in with the S.W. part of the island, we found an\nextensive reef, upon which the surf was breaking with great violence.\nWe hauled round to the east side, passing two small uninhabited\nislands, but there was not the slightest appearance of a\nlanding-place, the surf breaking heavily as far as we could see.  At\nfour, P.M. we anchored on the north side, in seven fathoms water, and\nsent boats in search of the harbour, along the west shore.  In the\nevening, they returned, having found it, and on the following\nmorning, we got underway, and beat up for it.  When we had advanced\nnear the opening, through the coral reefs that extend from the shore\nseveral miles, a Mr. Strong, an American, came on board, and piloted\nus in through a difficult passage.  The channel was narrow, and very\ncrooked; but we had not less than three and a half fathoms water.\nOur anchorage was within a coral reef, about a mile from the shore,\nin four and a half fathoms.  On the day previous to entering the\nharbour, we discovered that the head of our mainmast was decayed, and\nbadly sprung.  In this situation, we congratulated ourselves in\nhaving found a secure harbour, where the water was tolerably smooth,\nwhich was very essential in fixing the mast securely.\n\nNearly all the inhabitants of Toubouai, consisting of about two\nhundred, were living on the side of the island where we were\nanchored, in two different settlements.  One of them was the\nresidence of two Otaheite missionaries, who governed in spiritual and\ntemporal affairs; and at the other, was the residence of the king,\nwho, since the coming of the missionaries, retained but a small share\nof the power that formerly appertained to his station.  He lived on\napparently good terms with the missionaries, fearing their influence\nwith the people, but secretly declaring his aversion to them.  He was\nthe more afraid of offending them, as there was a living example of\ntheir displeasure constantly before him, in the person of one who had\nformerly exercised the regal authority in the missionary village, of\nwhich they had divested him for disobedience, and compelled him to\nlive in the condition of a common private person.  Soon after the\narrival of the missionaries, the people became divided into two\nparties, one of which advocated matrimony, and the other the\nunrestrained indulgence which is practised in a state of nature.  The\nfirst, called themselves the missionary party; the latter, the party\nof the Tutiori.  After a long struggle for the ascendency, the\nTutiories took up arms and retired from the habitable part of the\nisland, declaring themselves independent of the missionaries.  They\nremained for several days undisturbed in their disobedience, when a\nparty was sent to bring them to terms.  The Tutiories at first\nretreated, but finally made a stand, and after a slight show of\nresistance, submitted, promising to go home and live in the\nobservance of the missionary precepts.  The dethroned king, was at\nthe head of the Tutiories.\n\nAt the lower village, as it was called by us, where the king lived,\nwas a party of our countrymen, who had been there for a number of\nmonths building a vessel.  They had completed the frame and commenced\nplanking, when, unfortunately, a quarrel arose between them and the\npeople of the missionary village, which terminated in open hostility,\nand the loss of several lives.  One of the white men only, was\nkilled.  Scarcely had they made peace with the natives, when they\nquarrelled among themselves, and nearly half of their number (four or\nfive) discontinued their work, and waited only for an opportunity to\nleave the island.  This mutinous disposition of a few, paralized the\nefforts of the whole party, and it was probable from appearances,\nthat the labour they had bestowed with so much effect, would be\nentirely lost to themselves and their employer, Captain Dana of\nMassachusetts, whom we had seen at Oahoo.\n\nThe king and myself, became high carnies, (or great friends) the day\nafter our arrival; and from that time until our departure, he did\neverything in his power to merit my regard.  My mess was constantly\nsupplied with bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, tarrow, and bananas; and\nwhenever I was on shore, he waited upon me everywhere with the most\nfriendly attention.  Our friendship commenced in the following\nmanner, simple enough, it is true, but I believe it was not the less\nsincere on that account.  Seeing me with a jack-knife in my hand, he\nexpressed a wish to look at it, when I told him that he might have\nit.  He received it, and after observing me for a moment, put his\nhand upon my arm and remarked, now you and I will be high carnies.  I\nsincerely reciprocated his kindness, so strongly recommended by the\ndisinterested simplicity with which it was proffered.  Two or three\ndays after our arrival, I landed with a view of traversing the\nisland.  I found king Dick, as I used to call him, upon a bank of\ncoral that stretched out from his house, with a long wooden spear in\nhis hand, looking about in the holes for fish.  He begged me to wait\nuntil he had taken one for his dinner, and he would accompany me.\nAccordingly, having succeeded in a few minutes afterwards, we set off\ntogether.\n\nThe island was two or three miles wide, and we had not proceeded far,\nwhen we came to an extensive marsh that runs through the middle of\nit.  King Dick stopped, and insisted upon carrying me over on his\nback.  Feeling that it was too menial an office to be performed by a\nking, although an untutored native, I remonstrated with him, and\npositively refused to be carried; but after resisting his importunity\nfor some time, he took my musket in his hand, and I mounted on his\nshoulders.  The marsh was several hundred yards wide, and king Dick\nfound his burthen very heavy before he landed me on the opposite\nside.  We there entered upon a romantic and extensive plain, covered\nwith cocoa-nut, and bread-fruit trees, plantain walks, papayas, &c.;\ninterspersed through which, were numerous huts that appeared to have\nbeen long deserted.  We traversed this plain for miles, with little\nvariation; the same pleasing prospect everywhere presenting itself,\nwhen suddenly king Dick stopped, and made the whole forest ring with\nthe shrill notes of his voice.  After repeating it for several times,\nhe was answered at a distance, and soon afterwards, we saw a native\nmaking his approaches towards us.  King Dick said something to him,\nand he ascended a cocoa-nut tree, after the manner of the people of\nthe Marquesas, and threw down a sufficient quantity of nuts to quench\nour thirst.  He afterwards conducted us to a house where there were\ntwo women and several children.  They were delighted to see us, and\nhospitably proffered whatever they had of refreshment.  They gave us\na preparation of dried bread-fruit, of which king Dick ate very\nheartily, but to me it was scarcely palatable.  Near the house there\nwere several citron and lemon trees, the only ones that I saw on the\nisland.\n\nIn our route back, we met with large quantities of sugar cane in a\nwild state.  We passed the burial-place of the village, where, beside\ntwo or three newly made graves, were rudely carved images placed\nthere in conformity to a native custom, that had not yet been\nabolished by the influence of the missionaries.  When we arrived at\nking Dick's house, we found dinner waiting for us.  It consisted of\nthe fish he had taken in the morning before our departure, roasted\nfowls, bread-fruit, tarrow, &c.  The whole was wrapped up in plantain\nleaves, and placed on a mat upon the floor, around which, we all\nseated ourselves, there being a number of visiters present.  During\nour repast, king Dick went frequently to a large chest, where he kept\na bottle of rum I had given him, and, after proffering me the bottle,\nhe would help himself, and lock it up in the chest again, without\ntaking the least notice of the rest of his visiters.  No miser ever\nguarded his treasure more penuriously than the king did his bottle of\nrum; not only on this, but all other occasions.  His house was large,\nand a lounging place for all the idle people of his village; and,\nalthough there were always a number present when I made my visits,\nand he never failed to offer me a portion of his favourite beverage,\nthe wistful lookers-on received not the slightest notice.  I once\nventured to propose to him to give some to his friends, but he said\nno, it was too good for them.  When, after a week's stay at Toubouai,\nour departure was spoken of, king Dick expressed the liveliest\nregret, and proposed going with us.  We told him that he would never\nbe able to get back again; to which he replied, that he should not\ncare about returning.  The day before we left, he sent me, on board,\nan abundant sea-stock, of fruits and vegetables, and a good-sized\nhog.  As a parting gift, I dressed him up in an old uniform of mine,\nthat seemed to give him infinite pleasure.  To his presents, his wife\nadded several pieces of the tappa cloth, some of which, were as fine\nspecimens of the native manufacture, as I ever met with anywhere.\n\nAt Toubouai, we added considerably to our collection of curiosities.\nThe most ingeniously wrought article, was a lash, used by the natives\nfor brushing the flies off of their backs.  The handles were carved\nto represent a man's face, or some animal familiar to them.  The lash\nitself, was, in several strands, finely braided from twine of the\ncocoa-nut husk.  The natives were, in general, naked, except a\nwrapper round their waists, and had a sickly and feeble look.  The\nisland is very fertile, producing, in many parts, large quantities of\ncocoa-nut and bread-fruit, and is capable, without further\nimprovement, of sustaining some thousands of people.  The population\nhas greatly diminished within the recollection of recent visiters.\nIt must have been much greater when visited by the mutineers of the\nBounty, who built a fort on the island, but afterwards became\ndissatisfied, and left it in consequence of the treacherous and\nhostile character of the natives.  The only survivor of those guilty\nmen, who is now the patriarch of Pitcairn's Island, states, that they\nhad war with the natives previous to leaving Toubouai, and that they\nkilled a great many of them.  His estimate of the inhabitants at that\ntime, is fifteen thousand.  King Dick told me, that the huts we saw\non the side of the island opposite to where we anchored, were once\ninhabited by people who were all dead.  We obtained wood and water of\na good quality, without much labour.  Hogs were scarce, and we got\nnone but what were presented to us.  The natives gave us a few\ndomestic fowls, in exchange for writing paper.  The paper was used by\nthe women for making paste-board for a bonnet, that had just been\nintroduced amongst them by the wives of the Otaheite missionaries.\n\nOn the island of Toubouai, there is a tree, the bark of which, makes\nexcellent cordage.  It is produced in great abundance, and grows to\nthe size of six or eight inches in diameter.  After the ship builders\nwere interrupted in their work, by the discontent of some of the\nparty, the remainder made a rope-walk, and devoted themselves to\nmaking rope of this bark.  They had several small cables, and a\nconsiderable quantity of rope.  We purchased some, and found it to\nwear nearly, or quite, as well as hemp.  Arrow root, grows\nspontaneously upon the island, and has been taken away by several\nvessels, as an article of commerce.  We were informed that the\nscarcity of hogs was in consequence of a great many having been\ncarried off recently, by a vessel belonging to the missionaries.\nAlso, that they lay all the small islands under contribution, and\nannually send their small vessels to collect the hogs, which they\nbarrel, and send to Port Jackson.  This may be true or not.  It was\npositively asserted.\n\nOur stock of bread was nearly exhausted, and what remained, was in a\ndamaged state.  Having failed in all our attempts to obtain a supply\nof yams, that would enable us to reach the coast of South America, an\nexamination was held upon the bread, to the end, that we might adopt\nsuch expedients as should be deemed most proper.  Valparaiso, was our\nmost direct port; there was but one inhabited island (Oparro,) in our\nway, and that at some distance from a straight course.  To avoid,\nhowever, so disagreeable a circumstance as being without bread, we\ndetermined to touch at Oparro, and get whatever we could for a\nsubstitute.  Accordingly, we put to sea on the 22d of June, and on\nthe 25th, made Oparro, a little before day-light, five leagues from\nus.  When we came near, its appearance was rude and inhospitable in\nthe extreme, being a mass of rugged mountains, about a thousand feet\nhigh, and eight or ten miles in circumference.  On the north-west\nside, there were no signs of inhabitants.  The mountains rose almost\nperpendicularly from the Ocean, and we sounded frequently, close to\nthe shore, without getting bottom.  In rounding the island, to the\nnorthward and eastward, we opened a valley, where there was a number\nof huts, and some patches of tarrow.  A boat was sent in shore, and\ntwo of the natives came on board, who informed us that there was a\nharbour to the eastward.  We continued on, and after landing at one\nor two other small valleys, where there were huts and tarrow patches,\nopened a beautiful deep bay, that had an appearance of great\nfertility.  Soon afterwards, an Englishman came on board, and offered\nto pilot us in.  He had not advanced far with the vessel, before she\ngrounded on a bank of coral, but fell off immediately, on putting the\nhelm down and throwing all aback.  We were everywhere surrounded by\nshoals of coral, and fearful of accidents, came to outside of the\nharbour, where we had ten fathoms of water on one side, and five on\nthe other.  The boats were sent off immediately, in search of tarrow.\nIt was planted everywhere, in large patches, where there was a small\nvalley, through which a stream of water found its way from the\nmountains to the sea, and at a distance, the hills were green with\nanother species we had not before seen, called mountain tarrow.  The\nlatter is superior to the low land tarrow, and will keep longer at\nsea.\n\nWhen we landed in the bay, which was several miles deep, we found two\ndifferent missionary establishments, occupied by natives of Otaheite.\nNo one else, that we saw, seemed to have any authority.  They\npermitted us to dig as much tarrow as we pleased, without asking any\nreturn for it, and by night, we had as much on board as we knew what\nto do with.  One of the missionary establishments was situated at the\nextreme depth of the bay.  On landing there, I was met by the\nmissionaries themselves, and conducted to their house, where their\nwives, who were also from Otaheite, received me, dressed in their own\nisland costume, with large straw bonnets on their heads.  After\nremaining with them for a few minutes, I repaired to the place where\nthe boats' crew were employed in collecting tarrow.  A group of\nnatives, male and female, had assembled round, none of whom, could be\nprevailed upon by the rewards we offered them, to assist our people\nin their occupation.  They had a sickly look, almost without an\nexception.  Their dress differed altogether from any we had before\nseen.  It consisted of a heavy mat of grass, weighing from ten to\nfifteen pounds, which was thrown over their shoulders, and another\nlight mat of the same material, for the loins.  Their deportment was\nmodest and retiring, and they evinced a disposition to have but\nlittle intercourse with us.  A few of their houses were scattered\nabout upon the hills.  They were extremely miserable, and might,\nwithout disparagement, be compared to dog kennels.  They were long,\nand very narrow, and about three or four feet high, so that when one\nentered them, it was necessary to get down upon the hands and knees.\nThe Otaheite missionaries were distinguished from the natives, by\nwearing the tappa cloth, of their own island, and an old cloth jacket\nthey had obtained from white visiters.  I added something to their\nstock of clothes, before I took leave of them, for which, they gave\nme many thanks.  When I returned on board, I found the other two\nmissionaries there, and several of the natives, who had accompanied\nthe captain.  They spent the night with us, and the next morning,\nshowed us where to obtain a quantity of the mountain tarrow.  It is\nlarge, and very much resembles the West India yam.  For a vessel long\nat sea, and requiring vegetables, there is none more valuable.\n\nThe Englishman who came on board to act as our pilot, was residing at\nthe island, in charge of a party which had been left there by the\nEnglish Consul at the Sandwich Islands, to collect beach la mer, a\nvaluable article of commerce, at Canton.  The collecting of\nsandal-wood, was also to be an object of their attention; but they\ntold us, that both were scarce, and difficult to obtain--a statement,\nwe considered, of doubtful veracity.\n\nAt 2, P.M., on the 27th of June, we got underway, and made sail for\nValparaiso, which is distant from Oparro, about three thousand five\nhundred miles.  This island, which is called by the discoverer,\nOparro, is called by the natives, Lapa.  It is situated in latitude\n27 degrees 34 minutes south, west longitude 144 degrees.  At 5, P.M.,\nwe saw the islands, called by Quiros, Los Corones, and hauled up,\nuntil eight, to clear them.\n\nFor the first three days after we sailed, it blew a severe gale from\nthe westward, after which, it became more moderate, but nearly all\nour passage to Valparaiso, was wet and boisterous.  It was less\ndisagreeable, however, than we anticipated, as the wind was almost\nconstantly fair.  We had the more reason to apprehend a severe trial\nof our fortitude, as it was in the dead of winter that we were\nadvancing into a high latitude, after having been a long time within\nthe tropics, and besides that, our sails and rigging were very much\nworn, some of our articles of provisions were quite exhausted, and\nothers, of the first necessity, reduced to a small quantity.  If,\ntherefore, we had encountered tedious gales ahead, we must have\nsuffered greatly in our shattered and ill-fitted condition.\n\nAt 4, P.M., on the 19th of July, we made the island of Mas a Fuera,\non the coast of Chili, seventy miles from us, and at midnight, passed\nclose to it.  At day-light, Juan Fernandes, was in sight, fifty miles\noff.  We passed it a little after meridian.  It is very mountainous,\nbut well covered with trees.  The interesting fable of Robinson\nCrusoe's adventures, has given it a lasting fame, and rendered it an\nobject of curiosity to all who visit this part of the Pacific Ocean.\nIt is very fertile, and has been tolerably well cultivated.  The\nSpanish captain-general of Chili, formerly made it a place of\nbanishment, and after the revolution took place in that country, it\nwas appropriated to the same purpose, by the patriots and royalists,\nas they alternately came into power.  A considerable town was built\nby the exiles, who were sent there at different times, and the finest\nfruits of Chili are produced in great abundance.  The cattle that\nhave been left upon the island, are running wild in large herds, and\nseveral persons have found it profitable to send parties there to\nkill them for their hides.  The island produces some sandal-wood, but\nit is small, and has never been collected in large quantities.\n\nFish, that very much resemble our codfish, and a variety of other\nkinds are taken in the greatest abundance around Juan Fernandez and\nMas a Fuera.  It is believed that if a fishery were established there\nby some of our enterprising countrymen, it would be found a source of\ngreat emolument.  The privileges that might be considered necessary\nfor the prosperity of a company formed with this object, could easily\nbe obtained from the government of Chili, and there is no apparent\ncause why the most successful results should not be realized.  It\nseems only necessary to call the attention of our capitalists to this\nsubject, to have all its advantages secured to our country.  It has a\nfine harbour for the prevailing winds of summer, but in the winter\nseason, when the winds set in from the northward, it is exposed.  It\nlies a little more than three hundred miles from the coast of Chili,\nand in the summer months I have known open boats to pass between it\nand Valparaiso.\n\nOn the 23d of July, we anchored in the harbour of Valparaiso, a\nlittle before day-light, to the gratification of our friends, who\nwere becoming very much alarmed for our safety, no information of us\nhaving been received during the whole period of our absence.  Thus,\nin a vessel of 180 tons burthen, poorly fitted, and having on board\nonly about four months' provisions, when we sailed from the coast of\nPeru, we performed a cruise of upwards of eleven months in an\nunfrequented Ocean, rendering to our countrymen, and many of the\npeople whom we visited, important benefits, besides realizing the\nmost successful results in the primary object of our cruise.  Its\nbeneficial effects will long be felt by our countrymen, who are\nengaged in the whale-fishery; and, although we suffered many\nhardships, privations, and dangers, we were happy in being the\ninstruments, in the hands of Providence and our government, of\nproving that crime cannot go unpunished in the remotest part of the\nearth, and that no situation is so perilous as to justify despair.\n\n\n\n\n[1] A tree that resembles the locust.  It bears a pod, like that of a\nbean, which is given by the Peruvians to their horses.\n\n[2] A retail grocery and tippling shop.\n\n[3] Spirits distilled from the grape.\n\n[4] Mattee, mattee--Very bad.\n\n[5] Very good, or very well.\n\n[6] Don't you want a wife?\n\n[7] Com.

We afterwards saw them so\nfrequently at sea, where no land was known to exist, that their\npresence produced no other interest than would have arisen from the\nappearance of a gull, or any other aquatic bird.\n\n[9] When the steward was informed of his sentence, he asked Comstock\nhow long a time he would give him to make his peace with\nGod?--\"Fourteen seconds!\" was the reply.\n\n[10] Tamon, High Chief.\n\n[11] Called the Reef Chain Tide Islands.\n\n[12] Lay witnessed the execution of a man during his residence at the\nMulgraves.  I do not remember the nature of his offence.  He was not\nbound, or in any way confined; but, after it was determined that he\nshould die, several men attacked him with spears and stones.  He\nfought desperately to the last, although his situation was altogether\nhopeless, freely bestowing upon his enemies the epithets of cowards\nand murderers.  Even when he could no longer resist, his spirit was\nunconquered,--and he breathed his last, with expressions of scorn and\nhatred on his lips.\n\n[13] Lay frequently saw the people, who performed the execution I\nhave mentioned in a former note, throw away portions of their food,\nas an offering to the spirit of him they had slain.\n\n[14] Crimacu, as it is pronounced by the natives.  The missionaries\nwrite his name Karaimoku.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JOURNAL OF A CRUISE OF THE UNITED STATES SCHOONER DOLPHIN ***\n        \n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous oneâthe old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

intercourse vessels anchor. indians provided float call balsa, which pass through surf, cases great emergency, boat live it. composed merely two bundles long reeds, bound compactly together, tapering little one end, two bundles secured each other, small ends coming point, somewhat resembling appearance bow boat. middle hollowed sufficiently man seat himself securely. usually about fifteen feet long, two three feet wide. calculated one man only, who directs paddle. one day witnessed wonderful skill management balsa. surf breaking furiously, men, accustomed work it, advised not go board ship. whilst standing shore, several around me, boat appeared just without heavy rollers setting in, filled people, who evident strangers danger about encounter, dashing fearlessly into surf. indians near made motions, called not advance further, neither saw nor heard warning. observing this, six eight launched balsas, few minutes midst breakers. just time, boat moment afterwards darted forward great velocity, suddenly disappeared. wave broken, foaming over her, another terminated existence every person board; but, before next swell, came rolling quick succession reached them, each man upon balsa, skilful intrepid indians bore safely shore. remained few hours huanchaco, continued north, 25th august, came up lobos islands, latitude six degrees south, distant about hundred miles coast. barren rocks, rising some places several hundred feet, any appearance vegetation. aid glasses, saw distance number people upon inhospitable rocks, supposing some unfortunate seamen, whose vessel cast away, hove to, view affording relief. upon examination, however, proved indians coast, who come here catamaran, upon fishing enterprise, season great quantities fish, resembling mackerel, taken shores islands. previous ascertaining who fishermen were, landed small island nearer us, where, side hill, forty fifty yards distant, saw several hundreds seals basking sun. rock rose perhaps hundred feet, many seals near top it. noise landing gave alarm, and, cut off water, made best way other side hill, joining terrific growl like many furious mastiffs. reached top hill, descending opposite side, overtook them, very wantonly killed several. large many weighed least five six hundred pounds, motions extremely clumsy. whenever came near growl, snapped like ferocious dog, long teeth warned not approach within striking distance. considering immense size, astonishing bow slight blow kill given nose. if, however, fatal part missed, receive severe blow upon any other part head, suffer little injury, become extremely tenacious life, particularly time swell. nose then longer mortal part, almost impossible subdue them. witnessed several instances kind, poorly provided weapons proper purpose, withal unskilled use them. descending top hill, there one narrow defile which escape, there floundered nearly half hour, tumbling over each other three four deep, until last got into native element. north side lobos islands affords fine harbour, saw small vessel anchor waiting proceeds cargo, which landed coast place called lambayaca. 26th august, anchored peyta, latitude five degrees south. last place which convenient stop, here, gratification, enabled obtain necessary refreshments cruise. filled deck pigs, poultry, vegetables, considerable expense succeeded, after much trouble, obtaining supply good water. peyta situated deep bay, good harbour, formed two projecting points land, many leagues surrounded barren sand. seaport interior city, called pieura, receives distant valleys all necessary consumption inhabitants strangers, who visit purposes trade. supplied water river empties itself into sea, near small indian town called golan, whence found necessary resort supply. proceeded there, anchored vessel within mile two town, only method which obtain water, brought calabashes mules. saint's day, village all frolic mirth. groups men women everywhere seen, dressed fantastically, singing dancing along streets. called upon governor, who white man, very early morning, report arrival vessel, object visit. just risen hammock, received many expressions civility, proffers assistance. house little better than captain port santa, appearance not more prepossessing. room into which ushered other floor than ground beaten hard, which several large piles pumpkins, bags beans, indian corn, which proposed sell before official interview ended. immediately after breakfast came board visit captain, bringing him several emales. remained board nearly all day, annoyance every body, evening removed shore great difficulty, freely partaken hospitality. soon after arrival peyta, invited dine governor, who treated great kindness hospitality. some months previous arrival, son shipped himself talcahuana, board dolphin, common sailor, discharged arrival here, permitted remain friends. spoken amongst person who compelled fly home improper conduct some kind, now whole mystery explained. father one most respectable patriotic men place resided; son youth bad disposition, given him great deal trouble. revolution first commenced section country, provided himself uniform patriot officer, went about country, stranger, slightly known, under authority pretended commission, took, violence, cattle horses farmers, whatever else possess himself of, which converted into money own purposes. sometimes even pressed indians soldiers, compelled assist him carrying off plunder. length, exactions became heavy, levied tyrannically, gentleman resisted him, questioned legality authority. numbers fired indignation against him, propriety conduct sooner questioned, than investigation followed up such activity, that, finding there safety flight, preferred voluntary exile meeting just resentment people injured. suffered many hardships during absence, appeared return truly penitent. father's house entered. mother sisters deeply affected, received him all tenderness female sympathy, eyes overflowing tears. each embraced him, one most dear them; approached father (a man about sixty) who standing opposite side room, caught old man's eye bent indignantly upon him, turned away look humbled dust. whilst lying here opportunity witnessing solitary instance enterprising disposition peruvian indian,--a characteristic, believed, rarely possess, or, most, slight degree. board indian youth, who belonged part peru, several days held frequent conversations countrymen, who attracted board curiosity. one people concerted youth plan deserting. compliance arrangement, put off, during mid-watch, canoe, taking station just ahead dolphin, gave shrill whistle signal approach. lad, fearing detected, not venture answer signal, which repeated several times, officer watch suspecting object, gave long expected response, credulous indian came cautiously paddling close under bow vessel, where, amazement, made prisoner, compelled go board. captain came deck next morning, punished poor indian, impressing upon him belief intended detain, make soldier him. not sagacity enough know difference between vessel patriot man-of-war, conceiving there chance escape, made most pathetic appeals captain's humanity, appeared suffer all agony despair. captain ordered cartridge-box put over shoulders, musket placed hands. seemed frantic reality servitude, using utmost violence disengage himself cartridge-box musket, declaring again again soldier, most affecting manner begging captain god's sake permit him go shore. tormentors discontinued persecutions, jumped over stern into canoe, great activity, soon joined anxious friends beach, who assembled there, apprehensive captivity, awaiting result. 2d september, sailed peyta, shaped course gallapagos islands. trade wind moderate, accompanied fine weather. morning 6th, made hood's island, few hours afterwards, anchored west side, small harbour, called gardner's bay, only one affords. after dinner, captain took him twenty thirty crew, went pursuit turtle. island high mountainous, covered everywhere volcanic cinders, many which huge masses. men first very eager search turtle, whole crew, permitted, gladly engaged it. expected found turtle near shore; instead which scramble over rocks climb mountains, half time making way through brambles, expense scratches torn clothes. men never more disappointed than crew amusement catching turtle. sometimes wander about hours before found one, then probably mile two beach, much man well lift. sundown collected about thirty, large size. black grouper very abundant close anchorage, sharks numerous every fish taken lost one two hooks. got plentiful supply crew, however, course hour. following morning, joined captain meek, brig tamahamah, which vessel accompanied hither, making large party--went round island about ten twelve miles anchorage, expected find turtle more abundant. captain old cruiser here, well calculated make one agreeable party. stood cook us, day very warm, first essay landing, make large bower, under which prepare dinner. people then dispersed, look turtle, first which served up dinner, style relished less keen appetites than ours, which sharpened laborious exercise. night, collected upwards hundred, besides ten large green turtle, fortunate find beach near place landing. came assemble men return board, two missing, upon inquiry ascertained absent nearly all day. dispersed looked every direction until dark, every body much fatigued, party left search again morning, rest repaired board. morning, renewed labours without success, great reason began feel seriously alarmed safety shipmates. there water island, preceding day extremely warm, feared poor fellows soon perish, not already. search, too, attended considerable danger. wandering about distant parts island, sometimes, clambering over rocks mountains, changed course without sensible it, find ourselves pursuing way different direction supposed. afternoon, strength patience quite exhausted, parties returning night, lost men suddenly appeared beach, close vessel. pale emaciated, scarcely strength move one foot before other. clothes tatters, shoes worn off feet, which very much crippled long journey over sharp cinders. appeared story men, several times side island anchored, upon eminence overlooked vessel, thinking themselves other side, recrossed; when, astonishment, seeing nothing her, retrace steps; manner, wandering about many hours, almost despairing last finding relief. while wretched situation, several times quenched thirst killing turtle came way, drinking reservoir which nature supplied singular animal. since told seaman, deserted whale ship islands, accompanied number others, weeks, other water than obtained breaking open turtles drinking water found them. contained pouch resembles bladder, immediately connected stomach. large proportion size animal, some hold two three gallons. surprised see tameness birds. scarcely fly approached within few feet, many instances pick up hands. gannet, generally clear white, large goose, catch great ease; albatrosses, some grey some yellow, which much larger than any bird united states, rarely rise upon wing escape us. ran very fast, sometimes give chase one two hundred yards. bird, plumage form which differed respect mocking-bird, feed within few feet us, turtle-doves killed great numbers people, short poles. hood's island evidently volcanic origin. is, indeed, nothing mass cinders. covered slight growth scrubby bushes various kinds, occasionally tree four five inches diameter, met with. all vegetation, cactus seems best adapted it. there variety species; one which attains larger size than any other production island, spreads out into tree considerable height. kind cactus chosen turtle food. whalers, other visiters, go gallapagos islands animals, cut down number trees evening, following morning sure find turtle feeding there, although none seen vicinity preceding day. guanas not least remarkable inhabitants gallapagos. two three feet long shaped like lizard. colour varies grey jet black. easily caught quite harmless; often eaten said excellent. top head beautiful shining crest black yellow, which, sun, most brilliant appearance. except anchored, heavy surf breaks all round hood's island. high central part it, place which resembles dry bed small lake. surrounded ridges peaks cinders rising some places one three hundred feet, all probability crater volcano. places difficult access saw few seals, shy exception one two instances, not approach them. few killed hair seal, consequently little value. between hood's island small one forms harbour, there passage ships, very narrow, strong current runs through it, which always render dangerous ship attempt pass, particularly wind not perfectly fair. one, p.m., 10th september, got underway, stood over charles island, anchored six, essex bay. rock dismal, called commodore porter, excellent land mark, seems appropriately named. rises eastward essex bay, sharp crags fifty hundred feet high. few solitary bushes constitute all vegetation. approaching essex bay, entrance, alarmed several times strong ripple, casting lead found bottom ten fathoms line. essex bay, celebrated post-office whalers, which commodore porter resorted several times during cruise information. found letter there left whaler who visited charles island supply turtle. last river tumbez, one crew caught fever, which died. two others lost way mountains charles island, where, after wandering about considerable time, one complained companion head-ache, soon after sat down died. other found way ship after great deal suffering. charles island high mountainous, like hood's, covered thin growth bushes. distance mile beach there small spring water, which there footpath over crags hills, worn visiters search turtle, scanty supply which only obtained great labour. residence pat, irishman, lone dreary place, number years, made object curiosity all who visit island. here planted potatoes pumpkins, raised chickens; administering government island despotic sway, pat monarch although pillowed head upon rock, reposed rude limbs bed made bushes. story known all who read commodore porter's journal, which gives account pat's residence island, possessing himself person services black man belonging whale ship, who strayed too far companions, whom pat held durance long time. ten, a.m., parted company tamahamah, sailed marqueses islands. turtle which deck covered, very troublesome offensive about week, became quite domesticated gave not slightest inconvenience. two three weeks served crew constantly, lieu usual allowance salt provisions. most valuable substitute, important us, bound upon long cruise, well health crew preservation sea stock. number became comparatively small, discontinued general use them, served only once twice week. never fed them, aught see, equally fat healthy month after taken board, first day. sea stock nothing more convenient better calculated long cruise. put any kept almost any way, thought advisable feed them, there scarcely any vegetable substance not eat after little domesticated. liver turtle particularly delicious. fried, not unlike fine oyster, although partaken very freely of, ill effect ever experienced it. sixteen days after leaving charles island, made island rooahooga, one southernmost marqueses group. wind fresh blew steadily southward eastward, accompanied heavy swell. approached islands, some rainy cloudy weather, exception, whole passage attended clear days fine moonlight nights. latitude three degrees south, longitude ninety-five degrees west, observed remarkable appearance water, which, navigating unfrequented ocean, very much alarmed us. several different times during day, september 12th, passed through violent rips, times nearly whole ocean assumed appearance agitation boiling water. throughout passage, remarked, whenever wind hauled southward southeast, increased force. occurred frequently subject general remark. 20th september, latitude seven degrees fifty minutes south, longitude one hundred twenty degrees thirty minutes west, saw comet first time, thirty forty degrees above horizon, bearing east north. day-light, morning september 26th, several southernmost marqueses sight. all mountainous, covered vegetation, drew near presented pleasing contrast sterile gloomy gallapagos. stood along shore la dominica, admiring beautiful little valleys presented view quick succession, villages palm-thatched huts, surrounded clumps tall cocoa-nut wide-spreading bread fruit trees, formed scenes rural quiet calculated fill imagination most agreeable conceptions happy condition inhabitants. length came small bay valley more populous than any seen before, captain, great satisfaction, hauled up stood close towards island. lowered boat, providing ourselves few trifles presents, pulled into bay within few yards shore. beach already thronged people all ages, male female, who invited land most significant gestures, whilst many singing dancing express joy. surrounding rocks hills covered groups females, gaily decked off neat head-dresses white tapa cloth many-coloured robes, which floating wind, half concealing half exposing fantastically painted limbs. saw not land, men boys dashed into water whatever offer us, swam off boat. chief, who dry wreath cocoa-nut around brows, came off them; and, upon invited, got into boat, remained until departure, apparently giving orders time time who passing repassing shore boat. few minutes, presented considerable quantity cocoa-nuts, bananas, papayas, which gave return few trifling articles, most valuable which glass beads. chief eyes constantly fixed upon fire-arms, finally gave understand, motions, pistol acceptable him. intimation not comply; bore refusal great good nature, some time after store little presents exhausted, people continued bring off fruit without expectation any return. found serious refusal land, women came hills assembled rocks close us, where, nearer view, display persons more advantage, charm melody voices. there all joined songs, keeping time clapping hands, stopping occasionally receive applause men invite shore. several them, male female, swam off boat; about depart, insisted strongly upon going board use some violence get clear them. continued afternoon, soon passing la dominica, sundown made rooahooga ahead. weather squally island only fifteen miles us, lay night. daylight, found ourselves few miles distant middle south side island, bay presented itself, which, distance, promised afford anchorage. nearer approach, however, appearance changed, there few signs inhabitants, ran along toward west end island. part not much appearance fertility, although saw few large trees. high, broken, indented number small bays, none which large enough form harbour. rounding southwest point island sudden violent gusts wind. invisible bay situated little westward point, although somewhat appearance harbour, presents view beautiful sand beach, saw indications inhabitants. about ten miles north, anchored twenty fathoms water, rocky bottom, inaccessible rocky shore surf breaks violently. captain several officers went back invisible bay one boats, cave close shore found five six natives, who approach, fled hills, making signs people depart. cave, found few fishing-nets. tried prevail upon natives come near, demonstrations friendship answered only motions expressive hostility. landing difficult, shore rocky, considerable surf broke upon it, although bay tolerably protected projecting point. soon after meridian, got under way shaped course nooaheeva, which plainly sight rooahooga. stood along, fine breeze clear weather, three, p.m., rounded north-eastern extremity nooaheeva, spacious harbour, called comptroller's bay, opened view. about three miles deep, inner extremity two projecting points extend out more than mile, form three small harbours. sooner observed natives shore, than put off number large canoes pulled great rapidity towards us. wind light baffling, advanced slowly into harbour. few minutes, surrounded canoes, containing six eight men each. belonged different tribes, which attempted explain great earnestness speech gesture, one board who knew much language, greatly loss comprehend meaning. not followed long two canoes came along side, one each quarter, men crawled up side perched themselves upon hammocks, like many monkeys, called out loud voice, addressing themselves alternately natives side vessel opposite them,--one party exclaiming \"mattee, mattee, typee!\" other \"mattee, mattee,[4] happah!\" occasionally using angry gestures exclamation. too expressive not understand. belonged different tribes, typee, happah; mutually trying prejudice against tribe which not belong, order induce anchor own bay. both bays beautiful, happahs' most populous nearest us, gave preference; little before sunset anchored twenty fathoms water within cable's length shore. typees sooner saw standing happah bay, than hurried into canoe paddled off village fast could. happah valley romantic spot. plain, league two circumference, stretched back mountains semicircular form, presenting front clear white sand beach about mile long. plain covered cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit interspersed, near enough form continued shade without presenting appearance dense forest. scattered about every through trees palm-thatched habitations natives. rear plain, mountains rose precipitously, forming insuperable barrier against incursions other tribes. land rose gently left, almost barren added nothing beauty landscape. extreme right, considerable mountain point projecting far out into bay, separated happahs tribes lived beyond direction. nothing equal apparent joy natives saw anchored front village. whole tribe, which probably not exceed five hundred, flocked down beach, expressing satisfaction dancing singing. hundreds dashed into water swam off us, not time furl sails clear deck before vessel crowded people. show means making successful resistance against any hostile intention adopt, paraded musketeers upon deck practised them, ceremony appeared afford natives very great amusement. allowed remain board until dusk evening, number great make vessel uncomfortable, apprehending course night appropriate themselves many things find about deck, which not conveniently spared, sent most shore. chiefs few others who expressed great desire remain, permitted pass night us. following day, took few presents went over typee valley, visit tribe, celebrated most warlike nooaheeva. soon boat perceived, people came running towards beach every direction, before reached shore surrounded great numbers, who plunged into water swam off us. many conveniently accommodate permitted get into boat, treated unceremoniously not think prudent land. amongst who paid visit chief tribe. man about thirty years age, well-featured fine proportions. deportment grave dignified, like rest new acquaintances, who swam off us, quite naked except slight covering about loins. common people treated him great deference, never intruded upon part boat seated. made understand wished obtain muskets powder, purchase which caused five six large hogs brought down, tied laying shore. offered him whatever else thought induce him part them; obstinately refused any other consideration than muskets powder. large quantities cocoa-nuts, bananas, papayas thrown into boat people who swimming around us, lying there hour, many boat conveniently carry. variety presents, such beads, buttons, &c., all which common people very anxious obtain; chief take nothing less consequence than fire-arms gunpowder. offered him flints musket balls, which, although great value amongst natives, not receive. invited frequently, great earnestness manner, land, until found, repeated refusals, determined remain boat. bay typees rather smaller than happah tribe. live principally upon side mountain rises gently shore. number tribe appeared about same happahs. houses situated circular chains villages, rising one above other, base near top mountain, terminates rude uninhabitable cliffs. groves clumps cocoa-nut, bread-fruit trees every interspersed dwellings, mind observer impressed idea usefulness natives, gives double effect beautiful landscape adorned waving tops broad green leaves. several occasions remark inveterate dislike typees happahs entertained towards each other. morning after arrival, sailing-master went shore happah valley obtain altitude sun artificial horizon shy natives, all first, apprehending some approach him hostile intention, while back turned towards them, heard held great reverence place said tabooed, consecrated, made circle round place observation, told natives, who followed him great numbers, space within circle tabooed. stared him silence stood back it; by, intently engaged getting altitude, one natives, supposing employed some plan (to him incomprehensible) destroy typees, turned face sextant direction, crawled up gently behind sailing-master, without perceived him, suddenly tapping him two three times shoulder, exclaimed great energy, \"mattee, mattee, typee!\" readily supposed imagination, which very much excited before, not soothed salutation. turned upon native, expressing look manner consternation displeasure, which only met delighted indian repetition \"mattee, mattee, typee!\" morning 25th, went shore, company several officers, indulge curiosity ramble about valley. soon surrounded group natives, who followed wherever went. first object visit chief valley, whose residence found distance two three hundred yards shore. plain, oblong hut, thirty twenty feet. simple structure such first suggested untutored mind--a few poles laid over crotches, upon which framed triangular roof, whole thatched palm cocoa-nut leaves. entered regal hut found chief seated near one end it, who barely condescended notice approached make salutations. not prepared rude reception felt somewhat mortified find chief distinguished rank totally destitute courtesy. thought least risen sitting posture, expected more him than after experience taught right look people state nature. only furniture hut few coarse mats. one side five muskets, highly polished, arranged one above other, over which hung two kegs powder sewed up canvass, near few long spears war conch, ornamented human hair. made ourselves much home received more cordial welcome, indulged curiosity examining whatever saw, suddenly chief rose silence gravity once explained. remarked uncommonly large black robe thrown over him, without least suspicion covered any one else than himself. suddenly threw aside came near him there stood wife, girl about eighteen years age, who just finished making toilet. pointed look satisfaction, uttered \"motake,\" word afterwards learned, signified very good, very well. although naturally pretty girl, made herself hideous looking object. smeared face all over coarse yellow paint, upon which drawn streaks black green, than which nothing appeared more disgusting. assumed manner look affectation, such often observed some self-approving beauty, who, conscious charms, feels object admiration all around her. expressed disapprobation style ornament, stared look surprise, which seemed ask saying. soon gave both chief understand, signs; after which seemed not well pleased themselves each other; saw again evening without any ornament, looked all better it. while here, two grotesque figures came walked up austere look. profusion cock's feathers bound circularly round brows, broad gorgets wood ornamented red berries round necks, shell bracelets ornaments polished shell bone tied above ancles. each held hand fan palmetto. after standing few moments, keeping eyes fixed upon me, began jumping up down fanning themselves, applying both hands fan. first feeling surprise, mingled curiosity, know cause strange appearance; several times repeated exercise, scene altogether ridiculous not refrain laughing. soon afterwards, without even noticing chief, turned walked off. after leaving hut chief, visited number others, all which nearly alike. one saw two drums, only instruments music met with. largest hollow log, three four feet long, about foot half diameter, covered both ends shark skin. asked owner play upon it, which readily consented, seeming highly flattered invitation. accompanied voice thumping hands elbows drum-head; music made intolerable. beat, however, very good time, evidently high opinion performance. course ramble, one officers told indian, who joined us, signs, wanted some cocoa-nuts. good-natured fellow acquiesced without least hesitation, great astonishment, ran up tree standing near us, activity squirrel. tree forty fifty feet high, slight inclination, yet climbing seemed occasion him scarcely any exertion. not press bodies against tree hitch themselves up customary us, which, naked condition, not without injury. press bottoms feet against tree, clinging hands one above other, ascend upon all-fours. not strike less surprise thrown cocoa-nuts down, see facility stripped off hard husks without aid any thing teeth. such thing accomplished one found impossible. afterwards remarked same practise other places, other islands. general except old men, who, unless very robust, used sharp-pointed stick hard wood remove husk. not understand practice shaking hands. extended hand one mark friendly salutation, looked though question meant it; manner seemed think object feel skin, which always reciprocate raising up sleeves examining very minutely. morning 29th september, which last remaining comptroller's bay, made another excursion typee bay, taking chief happahs, who very anxious go. wondered this, tribes evinced much dislike each other; afterwards saw, intercourse natives south sea islands, uncivilized men capable much duplicity towards each other educated refined. arrived within hundred yards shore met chief whom formed acquaintance preceding day. saluted chief happahs way indicated former acquaintance, look manner somewhat formal. typee chief immediately spoke some one near him, who ran off few minutes returned calabash filled preparation bread-fruit, upon which poured quantity milk expressed cocoa-nut. offered typee happah chief, also invited partake it. tasted found very palatable. two chiefs seated themselves stern boat, made hearty breakfast, using fingers instead spoons. neither seemed very communicative, only few words passed between interview. there also boat young woman belonging chief's family, whom breakfast brought shell cocoa-nut, which preparation cocoa-nut bread-fruit, sour disagreeable taste. this, informed, food upon which women almost entirely subsist, tabooed eating whatever held high estimation men. chiefs finished repast, typee pointed hogs, which again caused brought down upon beach, saying wanted powder guns them, unfortunately neither valuable articles which make exchange him, consider nothing else equivalent. sent several old muskets very much out order, proposed go board repaired, making understand signs, return present hogs. anxiety great upon subject, found difficult put stop solicitations. mean time, however, saw schooner underway, dismissing typee friends, pulled away happah bay. approached within half mile happah village, schooner almost out harbour, chief observing anxious get board, proposed jumping into water swimming home, which readily consented. then stripped himself neck ear ornaments, which consisted two white pieces polished shell carved image bone, presenting token regard, plunged into water, leaving free pursue way vessel without trouble landing him. most ornaments worn people, bone shells, finely polished rudely carved. attach number piece cocoa-nut twine, wear around necks, wrists, ancles, most agreeable taste fancy individuals. more expensive difficult ornament obtain gorget. piece wood, semi-circular, about three inches wide, carved fit neck, covered beautiful red black berry, stuck gum oozes tree bread-fruit. hill rises left valley, planted variety seeds fruit, vegetables grain, natives valley totally ignorant every thing relates agriculture, not probable ever derive any advantage them. whilst happah bay, weather clear delightful. temperature regular change felt transition day night. 30th september, stood out comptroller's bay, ran down massachusetts' bay, place made familiar countrymen commodore porter's long interesting visit. two points form harbours comptroller's massachusetts' bays, about seven miles distant each other. one, p.m., clear projecting southern point comptroller's bay, three, p.m., anchored eight fathoms water, within half mile hill bottom bay, called porter's monument. before came anchor, water covered canoes, people both sexes all ages swimming towards us, soon vessel lost head way, crawling up all sides like many rats. not less delighted arrival than happahs. hundreds collected shore, all expressing satisfaction songs dances. amongst first visitors, two english sailors who deserted whale ships, long enough resident island converse language natives. came also native nooaheeva, native otaheite, both whom served considerable time whale ships, converse broken english. therefore want interpreters, seemed once introduce confidence friendship new acquaintances. harbour massachusetts' bay spacious affords good anchorage ships largest class. only part it, however, landing not attended difficulty some danger, east side, there fine sand beach quarter half mile long, one extremity which empties small rivulet pure excellent water into bay. landing effected watering-place beyond porter's monument, there more considerable stream fresh water, always difficult, surf high, cannot fail dangerous. place watered dolphin; swim casks shore, altogether, laborious undertaking. along east north part bay there long reef makes short distance shore, upon which heavy surf always breaking. entering bay, whole habitable part section island presented one view, forms most grand beautiful landscape. nearly semi-circular, rises like amphitheatre, fruitful populous circular ranges hills, until distance several miles, terminates circumference high gloomy mountains, tops which resemble massive wall. rude barren circle mountain contrasts finely fertile ranges below, covered forests cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees, huts villages every scattered about through hill dale. nor extreme elevation without interest beauty. number little cataracts reflecting rays sun looking like sheets liquid silver, break upon gloom sterile rock, adding brilliancy descend lively prospect below. after shower, not less than fifty splendid falls water seen, some which just perceptible through intervening space between hills trees, producing effect peculiarly agreeable. called porter's monument, round hill fifty hundred feet high, situated east extremity bay. here commodore porter fort, not vestige which now remaining. overrun wild luxuriant growth vines grass, trace footstep found. one side hill, near base, stretched bark line, which attended man who calls himself opotee, who declares hill beyond tabooed. upon one occasion, approaching it, some natives called out \"taboo, taboo!\" opotee immediately expressed willingness pass, countryman namesake, opotee. north porter's monument, back sand beach, navy-yard, all now overgrown bushes trees, some which attained considerable size. like monument, there indication ever occupied any human purpose, first october, day after arrival, went shore, taking great variety seeds, purpose planting most probable taken care come maturity. natives flocked round great numbers. there not less than hundred boys crowd men women followed me. highly delighted discovered object, which explained john luxon, native nooaheeva, who spoke english. whenever came rough muddy place, which frequently case, boys men, notwithstanding remonstrances, mount shoulders carry over, loud shouting. easily perceive frolic who engaged it, done out levity caprice moment; not feel first stimulated favourable impression conceived design. planted some things unfrequented places found clear spot, most seeds fruit-pits, enclosures natives. john luxon man some rank chief, possessed considerable property. one enclosures large seemed attended unusual care, devoted most attention. there, aided several natives, who laboured great assiduity, prepared ground made quite extensive plantation orange, lemon, cheromaya, peach, apricot, water-melons, pumpkins, potatoes, onions, beans, corn, variety other fruits grain, peru. expressed himself terms warmest gratitude, doubt natives already experienced most important benefits memento left dolphin's visit island. course days' occupation, several times driven into luxon's house frequent showers came over. sooner entered, than natives flocked after me, few minutes hut crowded. little boys girls here shewed same officious attention received making way village, expressed different manner. many approach surround fans, keeping going until rain ceased, again enabled resume work. kind civility, peculiarly agreeable, weather oppressively warm; not fail discover little attendants all candidates friendly notice bestowed civility expectation some reward. few trifles about me, not enough give all, felt loss way make presents, fearing least favoured mortified displeased. seemed however make difference. all \"motake\"[5] them. all seemed satisfied. return beach, found thronged men, women, children. all beauty fashion massachusetts' bay assembled honour arrival, decked out finest tappas, gayest colours. females dressed best style island, neat turbans tappa-cloth, white, ornamented colours, white robe same material thrown loosely over them, tastefully knotted one shoulder, concealing half bosom, wrapper round waist reached below knee. arranged groups dozen each, singing merrily clapping hands time music voices. little way men seated same manner similarly occupied. ladies, improve charms, used abundant quantity cocoa-nut oil, which filled air nauseous perfumes hundred yards round. many more highly anointed themselves yellow paint, which, cocoa-nut oil, running streams. some decorated themselves necklaces golden yellow fruit which bears strong resemblance pine-apple, emits powerful offensive smell. distance, variegated robes flying wind, appearance altogether agreeable, upon near approach scene animated beyond description. dusk evening signal dispersion, some went one way some another. second october, wandered back upon hills, all boys followed preceding day. renewed frolic carrying me, whenever seated myself, came round many approach, each green leaf fan. entered unceremoniously number huts, almost always found one more men, nearly every instance, extended backs, heads resting log laid along one side hut, heels another, about four feet first. never rise receive me, utter \"motake,\" perceived them, make motions did, offering same time fan, one which using almost constantly. course ramble, met little girl, twelve fourteen years old, who very pretty, attended servant, only instance which remarked such thing island. evidently walking out make visit, just arrived house destination met her. put some beads round neck, which seemed delight very much; old man present, whose hut about visit, assumed angry look, seemed threaten manner. changed conduct, however, made him trifling present, little girl, taking hand, led father's hut. chief some consequence, indicated possession two three casks powder, six muskets. took down, displayed very ostentatiously, wanted know not others dispose of. conduct altogether kind hospitable, acknowledgment which made him present departure. whenever wanted cocoa-nuts quench thirst, only signify one men following about, supply nearest tree. one fellow very much amused. carried arms full cocoa-nuts following about nearly all day, returned vessel presented him musket ball, which perfectly satisfied, said \"motake,\" went away. returned beach evening, found natives, male female, assembled great numbers day previous, amusing themselves same way. females again finest attire, distance any else mistaken assemblage fashionable belles. apprehensive men, number whom work shore, very much annoyed intrusion natives. this, however, not case. commenced work morning circle made, comprehending whole space wished occupy, which told natives tabooed, there not instance passing it. next day held quite fair beach. amongst other things, trade large quantities cocoa-nuts bread-fruit. former exchanged small pieces tobacco; piece iron hoop, fashioned into tool instrument husbandry, demanded latter. all day beach, cooking eating bread-fruit cocoa-nuts. evening, boys men amused playing soldiers, ranging themselves line sticks muskets. one officers took particular pleasure making grimaces, talking gibberish natives imitation manner speaking. very offensive them; respected too much betray displeasure. upon one occasion, however, amused himself way boys, about hundred whom assembled, encouraged retaliate him, clucking like hen. soon discovered disagreeable him, assembled round him like many little furies, clucking all might. seemed delight opportunity revenging themselves upon him, which most amply, not let him rest moment until went board, which soon afterwards, highly displeased conspiring indians against him. often amused strange ridiculous taste natives article dress. all desirous obtaining clothes, number old garments given them, exchanged curiosities officers crew. obtained, whether fitted not, indians immediately put on, scarcely ever more than one garment time. thus, half naked half attired, native walk about exceeding gravity, admiring himself, believing every one else equally pleased genteel appearance. whenever seated themselves sing, person selected occupy conspicuous station, perform dance round circle, slowly, most graceful native style, striking same time hollow left arm right hand, time music voices. distinction always conferred upon some one who obtained old jacket tattered shirt. jacket, sure buttoned closely round him, two three remaining buttons, sleeves, not torn off, probably not reach more than half length arms. thus attired, perform evolutions round circle slowly, most serious air, stopping occasionally receive applause singers, who bestowed upon him great enthusiasm. soon after daylight, one morning beach, curiosity led place, number females busily employed collecting something rocks. approached discontinued occupation, fled, called back, prevailed upon renew occupation. each provided green leaf, which gathering rocks species fine green sea moss small snails. preserved leaf intended families home. ate freely them, said \"motake.\" moss tender, other taste than salt water, which covered high tide. snails not larger than pea, covered hard shell, broken, heated tongue like pepper. moss, gathered, most disgusting appearance. told englishmen, residing here, natives esteem very great delicacy. one females infant few months old, which teaching swim holding pool water, occasionally letting go. infant make slight effort, let go mother, and, doubt, taught swim almost soon walk. third october, walking through habitable part valley, every met females, who addressed smile, finely modulated tone voice, \"coare ta whyhene?\"[6] father one these, good naturedly conducted hut chief, highest blood any valley. man upwards fifty, apparently more civilized than any natives seen before. told interpreter say, felt pleasure seeing hut. about forty twenty feet, constructed same way occupied happah chief, differing respect common people, except dimensions. rank importance displayed possession six muskets, two casks powder hung directly fronting door, which chief took occasion point out soon after entered. him treasure, and, fact, wealth consequence every individual seemed estimated standard alone. powder covered over canvass, muskets highly polished. one side hut two logs, about three feet apart, between coarse mat, convenience laying down on, one log intended head, other feet. whilst here, number visitors came in, and, walking directly logs, without noticing any one, threw themselves down between them, heads one, feet other, lay, fanning themselves, looking us, without saying word, except once twice, saw looking them, saluted \"motake.\" middle hut coffin chief's father, who died about six months previous. trunk large bread-fruit tree, six eight feet long, highly polished, lid ingeniously fitted, place contact not seen closest examination. told father great warrior, friend opotee.[7] before door swivel, number shot, said obtained opotee. prized very highly, although not least use him, except served gratify vanity. expressed desire know manner which prepared paint, used females, directed son get some root, grind between two stones, mixing little water it, only process required. gave chief's wife (who old woman) some beads, cotton handkerchief, which delighted, threw both arms around neck, embraced most affectionately. painted all over, quite yellow, thoroughly smeared clothes, paid dearly expression regard. parting, chief presented hog (the only one obtained marquesas), some sticks tappa tree, offered whatever acceptable me, about house. also exchanged names, promised again visit him, opportunity afterwards. son accompanied board, carrying presents father made me, all way calling \"kappe,\" name father, himself, name. evening, returned vessel, crowded natives, work day completed. men women different circles, singing songs. women, resembled croaking great many frogs. quick lively motion hands, accompanying various modulations voice, exhibited great activity, command muscle, far more pleasing than music. there one amongst females, who possessed great powers voice, utterance strange sounds, which none rest accompany her. performance seemed distress very much, certainly very disagreeable; yet natives all stop occasionally, listen her, and, done, exclaimed, seeming surprise, \"motake!\" 4th october, took boat, prepared arms, providing myself few presents, ran down lewis' bay, ascertain depth water entrance harbour, difficulties probably attend running schooner, whether afforded any better prospect than other places visited, obtaining supply hogs. distance only six miles, and, fine breeze, entrance harbour little more than hour. very narrow, formed two high points land, depth water abundantly sufficient ships largest class. heavy broken swell made entrance appear difficult: and, without fair wind, confined, hazardous attempt it; gorge once passed, enter large smooth basin, there scarcely ripple, land rising high all around it, points locking each other. basin found good anchorage, four nine fathoms water, clay bottom. lewis' bay divided into two parts projecting point rocks. first landed which fronts entrance, rather went into edge surf. great many people, all ages, came swimming off through surf, few moments boat full them, fruit various kinds. anxious land, saw there great difficulty getting off again, event any misunderstanding them, which not altogether impossible. not remain long, but, dismissing natives who crawled into boat, hanging gunwale, pulled round point rocks other landing. first went into part harbour, perceive only two three persons, who afraid come near us. gradually relaxed timidity, however, kept nearing little, until last prevailed upon get into boat. soon saw muskets, which thought intended trade; which only protection, ran away, saying, bring hogs directly. mean time news arrival spread, far wide, over valley, people came running every direction, whatever most readily possess themselves of, trade. every body wanted muskets, chief seven eight hogs brought beach, all which offered one gun. after spending hour two here, most friendly terms natives, prepared depart, missed one shoes, thrown off wet. search made boat, without finding it, remarked, native seen crawling water considerable distance rock near shore, deposited something, returned. upon examination, found shoe wrapped up piece tappa cloth, indian stolen it, without reflecting possession one shoe, without other, value him, perhaps not caring whether not, gratified propensity steal. returned short distance, held shoe up show natives recovered it, set up loud laugh, which interpreted into applause, ingenious exploit countryman. valley lewis' bay not compared either other places visited island, beauty fertility. is, however, quite populous, scenery grand picturesque. land gradually rises small plain below, like valley occupied typees, succession hills, terminates perpendicular high ledge rocks. returning lewis' massachusetts' bay, wind ahead, pulled close shore, which, nearly whole distance, rises abruptly, ocean, height six seven hundred feet. numerous falls, which only perceptible heavy mist, before reached water, leaping top, whilst sea beat sides unceasing fury, throwing spray height more than hundred feet. whilst tugging oars, contemplating magnificent scene, sea suddenly became unusually agitated, threatened, every instant, swallow up boat. pulled directly shore, half hour situation very critical, after which sea became regular. phenomenon, remarkable, baffled all speculation, entirely loss determine respecting cause. arrival board, learned vessel narrowly escaped driven shore squall not fault anchorage, consequence baffling winds which several times driven vessel over anchor, whereby fouled cable, tripped violence squall. natives, usual, assembled shore near us, amusing themselves customary way, singing dancing. females, learned some dolphin's crew, not good taste use cocoa-nut oil, paint, such profusion, left off, well golden yellow fruit, which also highly disapproved of. improved appearance, seemed sensible superior estimation which held. wild ladies, truth, who, first arrival, came swimming round, like many mermaids, grew very fastidious short time remained island. after first day two, requested allowed go board, boats, then, seeing some officers carried through surf seamen, nothing less please them, honour visit, gallanted board same ceremony. sailors gallantly condescended gratify two three them; but, instead taking boat, most uncourteously let fall into first heavy roller encountered, leaving choice swimming boat, back shore again, after which none ever asked carried. regard superstitions worship, learn little. john luxon told me, tabooed father, who chief, common man dared pass over head. usually dressed sailor's shirt trowsers, old hat. came off regularly every morning, ate three time day, taking seat table, without least ceremony, never waiting asked. one day, some one had, designedly accidentally, thrown some bread john's hat, which not perceive took up, put on. felt bread upon head, threw hat off instantly, and, look utmost horror, exclaimed, \"who put dat dare? taboo here!\" (putting hand head) \"to-morrow sick, die!\" this, repeated over number times, great earnestness manner tried find out who put bread hat, insisting upon it, that, morrow, sicken die. morrow, however, came, john alive well, heartily laughed foolish superstition, came board usual spend day us. not believe john same implicit faith taboo afterwards. tried find out him meant tabooed, spoke english badly, seemed understand little matter himself, not much wiser explanation. told here, that, few years since, missionaries society islands, moved benevolent purpose converting marquesas islanders christianity, sent one number reside massachusetts' bay. missionary landed amongst charge, whom received characteristic kindness hospitality. other notice taken him, however, than bestowed upon most poor ignorant mariner, seeking asylum amongst them. permitted fix upon place residence, live such way pleased him best. soon commenced preaching doctrines faith. natives listened him, wondering all said, not less singular manner life,--to unexampled, all acquaintance whites,--and, certainly, unparalleled amongst themselves. always seen white men, who visited islands, take liberties females, mingle all pleasures, whilst man, who called himself messenger great spirit, lived life celibacy, retired all that, them, amusing agreeable. free interchange opinion taken place amongst them, respecting him, came conclusion, differently made constituted all other men ever seen, curiosity raised highest pitch, they, levity peculiar savages, determined subject him scrutiny. missionary, alarmed disposition evinced little respect character personal rights, took departure first opportunity, since which attempt made convert natives marquesas christianity. men marquesas, were, general, quite naked. few ornaments worn either sex. women frequently other ornament than small flower, stuck through slit ears. some men wore polished whale's teeth round necks, some shell bracelets, not common use. few tattooed all over, others slightly. mode tattooing seemed altogether matter fancy. some indulged most whimsical taste, indelibly pricked into flesh, fish, birds, beasts, all kinds known them. others tattooed black, even inner part lips. art high estimation amongst them. there men, who pursue regular business, great favour countrymen, skilful performance. women tattoo more tastefully than men. feet legs, half-way knee, usually covered figures, wrought great neatness, right hand arm, half-way elbow, often similarly ornamented. both men women commonly wear hair short, instances contrary met with, persons invariably disgusting appearance, hair hanging long disagreeable looking matted locks. men finely formed, large, active; both men women would, many instances, considered handsome, not fastidious objection copper colour. teeth very beautiful, formed subject remark all, while amongst them. not think that, all people came under observation nooaheeva, there single one bad teeth. more remarkable men, accustomed all lives strip husk cocoa-nut manner described. plurality wives not admitted amongst under any circumstances. sexes rarely live together, man wife, until arrived middle age life. man wishes take wife, first obtains consent female, who solicits friends, which, obtained, girl's father kills hog, or, chief, number hogs, makes feast, which all friends both parties invited. after ceremonial performed, which occasion great merriment, parents girl furnish few pieces tappa cloth, conducted husband house. females, although invited feasts, not permitted partake hogs, roasted occasion. tabooed men alone. hogs scarcely ever used natives, upon occasion death marriage. chief, other person dies, possessing many hogs, great feast made. only arms, now generally used, muskets. most natives, who any property, own one more. not see single war club nooaheeva, few spears. met several persons, who scars musket balls, told received battle. each renegade englishmen living chief, who thought there scarcely any thing not perform. besides supporting them, gave all consequence chiefs intercourse natives, far own authority admit it. highly respected natives, even john luxon boasted superiority over other indians, speaking english. asked john, advantage speaking english him, which replied, enabled him cheat countrymen. whole face island nooaheeva high mountainous. every part visited composed volcanic cinders, evidently owes origin some great convulsion nature. whilst remained massachusetts' bay, weather mild pleasant. several heavy showers, which, one instance, only accompanied squall wind. after showers delightful contemplate beauty innumerable little cascades water every falling over rocks tops mountains. few hours, many become less brilliant, some quite disappear. found longitude anchorage mean three chronometers, one hundred thirty-nine degrees fifty-four minutes thirty seconds west; latitude, series observations, eight degrees fifty-seven minutes forty-five seconds south. october 5th, got under way, stood out light baffling wind, tacking very close both shores. nine, a.m., passed sentinels, bore up westward moderate breeze e.s.e. islands rooahooga rooapooa, plainly sight. clear weather seen least fifty miles. amiable character inhabitants nooaheeva, friendly disposition evinced towards upon all occasions, made feel regret leaving soon. course now lay before us, carried away all civilized world; islands way affording little tempt navigators visit them, known only places, existing wide surface ocean, where, few exceptions, inhabitants never seen face white man. anticipate other gratification contemplated visit them, than indulgence curiosity. weather became squally after departure marquesas, continued several days, during which time frequently deceived clouds assuming strongest appearance land, which steered two three times, under full conviction made discovery. picture ourselves, mountains, valleys, bays, and, confirm deception, frequently saw land birds flying about us. day-light, 10th october, discovered caroline island, bearing w.s.w., distant fourteen miles. weather side it, furious surf every sight, breaking upon reef some distance shore. stood along westward, nine, a.m., passed reef, makes out n.w. end island, protecting s.w. heavy easterly swell, prevailing winds. under lee reef, stood in, hope finding anchorage, getting frequent casts lead, until, great disappointment, discovered there deep sea-water within few feet bed coral, stretched off three four hundred yards shore, farther south west, high surf breaking, only place land, and, desirous exploring island, took small kedge coral bank, which rode easterly trade winds. here landed without much difficulty, made way shore, over coral, although full holes, looked though give way under feet. holes coral-bed one three feet deep, some appearance communicating ocean. holes, found abundance large very fine fish, which supplied crew great plenty. several different kinds, best which red grouper, long fish, dark colour, which name. boarding pikes boat-hooks only instruments used taking them, simple apparatus alone frigate's crew supplied short time. boat also sent fish alongside coral bank, myriads red grouper, large size; sharks numerous, that, every fish, lost two three hooks. tide rises, caroline island, three four feet, and, low water, coral-bank nearly dry. case landed, and, remained there several hours, fishing party surprised rise water, made difficult, somewhat dangerous retrace steps edge bank, holes many places not perceptible, water over heads. made situation more disagreeable number sharks come tide, which occasionally made bite feet legs. one man, who large bunch fish which trailed through water, closely pursued, fiercely attacked them, compelled take refuge upon rock lay way, which not again prevailed upon descend, until boat went relief. caroline island uninhabited. five eight miles long, vicinity anchorage more than quarter half mile wide. there some trees large size upon it, most places thick growth underwood. every bounded bed coral, which generally extends several hundred yards shore. saw animals it, other reptiles than small lizards. sea birds tolerably numerous, few sand snipe seen. weather side island, found cocoa-nut tree, that, all appearance, recently drifted shore. besides cocoa-nut tree, found two articles indian furniture. came inhabited island, there doubt, equally certain island never discovered, there none laid down upon chart, direction trade winds, caroline island, nearer than society islands. marquesas nearest caroline, any land known; distant upwards six hundred miles, differ bearing little general direction trade winds. cocoa-nut tree there two nuts, which appearance short time water. planted near anchorage. caroline island low, every flat, exception few sand hillocks, rise little above ordinary level. more than four five feet above sea. obtained boat-load pepper-grass pursely, which there great abundance; 13th, meridian, unhooked kedge, made sail westward. place landing caroline island, south latitude nine degrees fifty-four minutes thirty seconds; west longitude, one hundred fifty degrees eighteen seconds. previous taking departure coast peru, commander station furnished long list islands, said recently discovered whalers, now vicinity two them, one which laid down south latitude eight degrees forty minutes; west longitude one hundred fifty-nine degrees fifty minutes. other, south latitude, six degrees forty-two minutes; went longitude one hundred sixty-six degrees ten minutes. after departure caroline island, steered supposed new discovery, nearest us, latitude eight degrees forty seconds; and, cruised two days vicinity, bore away, under full conviction not exist, laid down incorrectly. search other island, equally unsuccessful; after running down degree two longitude, parallel latitude, continued southward westward, shaping course duke clarence island. whilst looking new discoveries, frequently deceived same false appearance land, noticed soon after departure marquesas, several times saw land-birds[8] flying about vessel. four, a.m., 29th october, discovered duke clarence island ahead, twelve miles us. day-light, n.w. end full sight, each side it, apparently great distance, tops trees just seen through haze morning, looking though rose ocean. approached nearer, great many islets rose view, connected each other chain coral reefs. sailing round them, discovered formed polygon, sides which narrow strips land coral reefs, comprehending within lake many miles circumference. first got close island, lake, intervening between most distant islets rose utmost limit vision, almost persuaded us, time, extensive group, instead one little island looked like speck upon general chart. lake everywhere protected against ocean, smooth, not undulation seen upon surface. wind light, sea smooth,--the air mildness elasticity spring morning; these deep green spots, upon wide waste ocean, truly beautiful. islets low, rising few feet above water, all covered thick growth cocoa-nut trees. run down within few miles shore westward, where, near beach, few huts, two canoes put off, pulled great rapidity, shortly afterwards not less than twenty sight. all part shore bounded coral reef, upon which breaking heavy surf, wished anchor, look water, continued leeward shore. under easy sail, canoes kept way us, constantly increasing number, having, each them, four seven men. one came very near us, save natives labour working paddles, threw end rope. laid hold very eagerly, instead tying some part canoe, expected done, hauled up close stern get, made motions give more. so, again motioned veer to. this, thought unnecessary, already sufficient purpose intended. found solicitations more not heeded, very deliberately took sharp instrument bone shell, cut rope off, several fathoms canoe. soon done this, took paddles, pulled away all might, soon again near enough rope thrown them, which called loud could, making, same time, significant motions. found not give rope again, paddled up quarter, one them, who powerful man, came board, without seeming fear least. several officers spoke him, tried call attention; but, without taking least notice any body, walked straight stern-netting, commenced most industriously throw into canoe every thing lay hands on. quarter-master others, who near, remonstrated him, vain, against such outrageous conduct. interference seemed only excite indignation, make him more active accomplishing design. found nothing else prevail him, took musket lay near me, gave him slight blow it, calling same time some men, who stood near, lay hold him. seized musket, struck him, taken overboard it, timely assistance who near. made escape before men get hold him, succeeded throwing into canoe log-reel line, besides number other articles, not conveniently spare. pursued canoe, taken stolen articles, all moved such rapidity, hope overtaking them, made attempt. natives other canoes witnessed success comrades carrying off booty, which displaying around them, great delight, encouraged come near, make similar attempt plunder. somewhat cautious, however, witnessed resistance made. next theft breaking off one rudder-irons waist-boat. captain, who near, prevailed upon fellow give up, which did, without least hesitation; but, remaining quietly was, seized opportunity, captain's face turned him, and, snatching piece iron out hands, jumped overboard, swam nearest canoe. all time close shore, getting frequent casts deep sea lead, moment overboard, line seen natives, made dozen canoes, instruments sharp shells, fastened sticks, endeavoured cut off. paid not slightest attention remonstrances threats, only way which prevent effecting object, hauling line fast possible. after running along shore several miles, seeking vain anchorage, began examine reefs, connected islets, great solicitude, hope finding opening into lake, whore protected wind sea. this, however, soon despaired, passing south-west point island, bountiful little bay opened view, upon shore which surf beat less violently than seen elsewhere. here hove to, sent boat shore look anchorage. soon returned report that, within less than half cable's length shore, bottom found, upwards hundred fathoms line. now gave up all intention anchoring, permitted natives come alongside, exchange whatever had, mutually acceptable each other. continued follow us, and, growing bold numbers, frequently threw board vessel clubs, cocoa-nuts, whatever canoes, used missiles. accompanied such loud shouting, become numerous, orders ordinary duty vessel not heard. some clubs large, capable inflicting fatal blow violence which thrown, apprehensions suffering some evil consequence licentious conduct new acquaintances, soon realised, one striking surgeon upon head. ill health, just come upon deck witness novel spectacle around us, unwelcome salutation given. alarmed first safety; but, gratification, discovered hat far protected head, wound not severe. soon natives saw schooner heave to, closed around us, many get alongside, came whatever offer. nearly hundred canoes assembled, several hundred men. saw hoisting out boat purpose sounding, became alarmed, took flight. inducement prevail upon come near us, whilst boat lay alongside, soon shoved off, took paddles, retreated fast could; saw took different direction, not object pursue them, all turned followed her. gathered around short distance, apparently afraid approach nearer, first making signs go shore, numerous group men, women, children, inviting people land. seeing boat not go shore, after duty assigned accomplished, returning schooner, natives one accord closed more nearly around her, intercept passage. officer boat made threats signs retire, which paid not slightest attention. canoe came each side boat, natives laid hold oars, man rising each canoe same time, barbed spear, which held attitude throwing. officer, feeling situation very critical one, thinking report pocket pistol cause desist, presented design fire ahead one canoes. not go off, snap signal sufficient men prepare defence, believing exposed greatest danger. seized pistols, one which each man provided, before officer interfere prevent firing (the noise confusion amongst natives such, not heard) one men discharged piece, ball passed through hand one natives. became alarmed extraordinary report pistol, immediately after it, seeing blood flow hand countryman, discontinued assault, retired precipitation. boat then returned schooner unmolested, natives flying every direction approached them. apprehensive report pistol, wounding one natives produce great panic amongst them, interrupt farther intercourse. agreeably disappointed, boat sooner hoisted in, than came alongside, much confidence, though nothing kind occurred. hour afterwards, wounded man seen canoe, fifty hundred yards us, apparently afraid come nearer. distinguished hand bound up green leaves. after making motions him, around us, holding up variety things acceptance, last prevailed upon come near us. saw sentinel, gangway, stopped, vain held up presents him, until sentinel removed. then came board, suffered wound examined dressed, trembling staring around him, like one greatest terror. gratified find wound not severe apprehended, ball passed through fleshy part hand, between thumb forefinger, without breaking any bones, probably without inflicting upon him serious injury. wound dressed, received few presents old iron, &c., him invaluable, left us, jumped one canoe another, activity monkey, holding up treasure, talking great vehemence, apparently delighted good fortune. natives nothing exchange few mats, some which finely wrought, cocoa-nuts, bone shell ornaments, fishing-hooks, which gave them, return, pieces iron hoops, old nails. witnessed several instances dishonesty amongst them, well entire want confidence us. whenever one presented any thing exchange, held firmly grasped hand, until received pay other; first obtained old nail iron hoop, without person, whom trading, getting firmly hold mat whatever be, sure keep both. every man carried long spear, some short weapon, slightly curved like sword. spears eight twelve feet long, some which one some two branches near end. pointed hard bone large fish, and, one two feet point, covered rows shark's teeth, immoveably fixed neat moulding twine passing through teeth, round spear. short weapons armed same manner all over, except small part left grasp hand. both formidable weapons, capable inflicting mortal wound. few wore dry wreaths cocoa-nut leaves round brows, which only kind covering saw any about heads, instances rare, thought probable chiefs. dress loins consisted two pieces, one which composed few plaited leaves, next skin, other consisted mat, two three feet wide, four long, beautifully fringed bottom, which served, not only pretty ornament, useful protection against flies, which almost everywhere amongst these islands very troublesome. strong robust looking men, very dark copper colour, most them, particularly old men, covered scars, gave understand occasioned wounds spears daggers. wore hair long, disagreeable looking matted locks. none heavy beards, general little. not improbable pull out fish-scales, practised marquesas, many others south sea islands. done compressing beard fingers between two large fish-scales, manner applying pair tweezers. great many natives, most women children, assembled shore, opposite us, remained all day, singing amusing themselves. females came off canoes. saw water, except small quantity one two natives cocoa-nut shells, and, much regret, ignorance language, not inquire obtained. land rose more than three seven feet above level sea, not land safety, means ascertaining whether any rivulets existed upon it. island seemed produce nothing, cocoa-nuts, which only food natives, except fortunate catch fish. towards evening stood out bay, hove off south-west point, sent party shore collect quantity cocoa-nuts, which there dense forest, promised abundant supply. people sooner shore than saw natives approaching different directions, armed spears paddles, making signals each other, signs, intruders depart. every tree some peculiar mark, whence concluded, considered property some individual. after sun-down, night closing fast upon party, who finding, determined manner natives, that, whatever took, violence, gave up enterprise, returned beach. fortunate so, tide risen considerably, surf increased dangerous degree. all, however, got off safe, wet jackets, eight, p.m., october 30th, hoisted boat, made sail. ran off fine breeze, half-past three, a.m., made duke york's island, directly ahead, sooner than expected. not more than three four miles off; deep hollow roar surf distinctly heard, foaming white crest seen through mists night, tumbled shore. hove until morning, made sail along land, towards south end island. island noted chart, uninhabited, discovered commodore byron, 1791; supposed, not little surprised, approaching southern point, see two canoes putting off us. one came alongside, other kept distance. first one man it, who exchanged mat piece iron hoop, returned immediately shore, followed consort. got southward point, which lee side island, hove to, sent boat look anchorage. shores similar those caroline clarence islands,--of coral, shelving suddenly into deep sea-water. somewhat better here, however, within half cable's length surf, let go anchor twenty fathoms water. although veered eighty fathoms cable, bottom smooth, angle depression great, drifted off. stood again, running vessel close edge surf (the wind blowing off shore) came eight fathoms. few minutes, native made appearance coral bank, near us, arms full cocoa-nuts, which held up, acceptance, waving same time green branch, frequently jumping about upon rocks, childish, playful manner. boat sent bring him off; saw approaching pretty near, threw nuts water towards her, hastily retired. coral bed, like caroline island, extended off fifty hundred yards shore, which, like that, perforated every holes, resembled, frail appearance, ice long time exposed rain. tide low, surf breaking lightly upon it, enabled land without difficulty. approach natives all ran off, considerable time not prevailed upon come near us. after while timidity relaxed, came round us, one one, until dozen assembled. still very much afraid, starting every motion made, attempted touch them, ran us, became shy ever. place landing, discover island similar duke clarence, narrow chain little islets reefs, coral formation, covered bushes cocoa-nut trees, comprehending within chain lake many miles circumference. place landing, island between ocean inland sea, not more than two hundred yards wide, appeared wide any part chain came under immediate observation. passing over borders lake, saw near centre large raft, number canoes filled people. first landing, surprised not see any women children, mystery which now explained, well singular visit received first approaching part island. person canoe sent off spy, reconnoitre us, report made, thought expedient remove women children, now saw place safety. not appear more than thirty number, men island not exceed fifteen. men resembled inhabitants clarence island, dress, colour, every thing, except sickly look, and, strength activity, seemed much inferiors. canoes also same. like inhabitants duke clarence island, nothing amongst indicated visit white men before. cocoa-nut, except catch fish, only food. bread-fruit trees seen growing upon either island. exchanged iron hoop old nails, rude shell ornaments, mats, cocoa-nuts, fishing nets. witnessed several instances dishonesty, practised upon us, each other. fishing-nets, which beautifully wrought, concealed, apprehension plunder them; made acquaintance us, found disposition towards friendly, persons, whom nets not belong, purloin, bring us, exchange pieces iron hoop. not long afterwards owner discover net possession one people, claim property, demand gratuity. way, made pay some instances three four times same thing, frequently (we began suspect) pretending fraud committed upon them, whilst themselves rogues. saw animals birds upon island, presented pair pigs, male female, which very much pleased, before left them, far acquired confidence, came amongst without fear, and, many instances, became troublesome familiarity. only water saw island few trunks cocoa-nut trees, stumps which hollowed out, whence supposed that, time drought, not always, supplied important necessary life. regretted more not find sufficient supply here, thinly populated state island admit sending parties shore, without least apprehension hostility natives, because landing such, permit embarkation, without great labour, risk losing boats. duke york island not inhabited, discovered commodore byron, thirty-five years previous visit dolphin, reasonable suppose, strong resemblance natives those clarence island, dress canoes same, came thence very distant period. distance these islands each other, only about forty miles, canoe, driven one direction other, tempestuous weather, soon sight it. towards evening returning board, found, regret, tide risen two three feet over coral bank, became difficult see holes, some which, now filled water, deep enough attended danger. besides this, surf, usual upon these coral banks, increased rising tide such degree, found difficult embark. guided observation, morning, however, got board safely, exception some trifling accidents. most serious which boat bilged against rocks. four, p.m. 31st october, got under way, steered westward. several days weather squally, wind variable, shifting suddenly all points compass, blowing times great violence. experienced strong currents setting different directions, which now cause serious alarm us, soon surrounded reefs chains islands, all low, seen only few miles clear day. 9th november, byron's island seen, 8 p.m. six miles us, soon afterwards shore lighted up number fires. surf beating heavily upon weather-shore. stood off until morning, when, driven leeward strong current, beat up island, passing several canoes way, great many others different directions windward, running down us. meridian, close land, beat about several hours, looking anchorage. once tacked, three fathoms, close coral bank, beating heavy surf, almost jumped upon it. 6, p.m. tenth, anchored ten fathoms, within less than cable's length surf, water clear, see almost every coral rock bottom. besides rocks, presented appearance splendid landscape trees copse-wood, ornamented most lively brilliant colours, which, affected swelling ocean, transformed into representation rich beautiful country mountain valley. whilst beating about, canoes assembling near us, great numbers, soon anchored, came along side, people jumping board without least hesitation, talking hallooing each other loud, almost deafen noise. not long board, before several detected thieving, threatened, seemed quite regardless displeasure, although expressed way calculated make sensible disagreeable consequences. all provided long shark's-tooth spears, walked about deck swaggering, independent air, seemed challenge, least, equality. few brought any thing else spears, which not dispose of, altogether, number appearance truly formidable. sunset, sent off, all returned respective islets. appearance byron's island, differed scarcely any respect duke clarence. dimensions formation perfectly similar; and, like latter, inhabited enterprising warlike people, whose dress, arms, canoes, manner life, seemed identically same. islet abreast all night illuminated numerous fires, air rung incessantly shouts hundreds people. day dawned, whole ocean whitened little sails canoes seen coming every direction, some far eye distinguish small object. hour, not less than hundred alongside, deck crowded natives. officer watch undertook wash off deck, which found altogether impracticable: not word understood noise made, pushed out way people, became insolent resentful. length, obliged resort some little violence clear decks unruly rabble, whose disposition thievery violence, became every moment more difficult repress. old athletic chief, whom captain treated more than ordinary attention, suddenly put arms round him, embraced him such herculean strength, constrained call men near him assistance; moment, rope around old chief's neck, broke grasp, captain enough indian courtesy, well pleased dismiss them. still remained near us, many allowed, came alongside. exchanged pieces old iron, coarse matting, flying-fish, shell ornaments, few disposed spears. one fellow, who evinced obstinate determination come alongside, ordered off sentinel, who pointed musket him. soon musket pointed, raised spear, stood attitude throwing until sentinel came shoulder, again took paddle; musket again presented, indian, same promptitude, raised spear, until sentinel, feeling awkwardness situation, reported circumstance officer. went forward, pointing native pistol loaded very fine shot, motioned him retire; upon which, raised spear me, discharged pistol legs, dropped arms fled greatest precipitation; afterwards remarked him outside all rest canoes, apparently afraid come nearer vessel. after example, none seemed disposed question authority sentinel. islands seen, since departure marquesas, resembling each other much, none affording indications water sufficient purposes, began think seriously, experience great inconvenience, perhaps suffering, before procure supply; determined, therefore, let opportunity escape us, examining every island came way, done without too much risk. view object, captain pulled shore, followed nearly all canoes; arrived edge surf, which heavy make landing difficult, remarked people shore, whom great many

when, finally, relinquished object, about return board, people shore dashed into water swam off, uniting those canoes, made violent attempt drag boat into surf. men promptly repelled them, dived bottom, coming up, showered volley stones into boat, which wounded few crew slightly, broke several pieces gunwale. midst excitement confusion prevailed, native seized pistol, which struggled violently carry off, until musket fired, taken into nearest canoe severely wounded; effect disperse natives, who fled boat every direction, returned schooner. hoisted in, came alongside, some got board. commenced getting underway, one anchors already up; other hooked coral rock, captain directed sentinel forward, give musket him, repair station. native, who talking captain, embracing favourable opportunity, seized musket, upon which fixed bayonet, jumping overboard it, swam towards shore, keeping half time under water. muskets fired him, bore booty safely through surf coral bank, where, although still within striking distance, marched away most perfect composure, until disappeared bushes. after bold theft, several boats prepared land search water, and, possible, recover stolen property. captain took lead, landed coral bank, arms ammunition wet useless, whilst boat, returning through surf, thrown upon rocks, bilged, before finally got off, almost every timber broke. fatality attended landing, forbade other boats attempt it, choosing rather remain defenceless situation, surrounded hostile natives, more serious consequence losing remainder boats. signals concerted previous departure vessel, directed fire intervals cannon, direction large hut supposed belonged chief. small group natives approached him, one whom, man advanced years, came up green branch hand; captain demanded him signs return musket, reply which, addressed some one near him, who ran off, about hour, brought without either lock bayonet; these also required, demand repeated occasionally discharge cannon direction chiefs hut. not long before lock brought, threats compel relinquish bayonet. situation captain party becoming more more critical every moment's delay. bank coral hundred yards wide, small parties natives, whom great numbers assembled bushes, frequently sally out throw stones them. other means protection defence than afforded guns, which fired whenever hostile parties made appearance. hustle shot over heads, fall cocoa-nut trees, proved superiority arms over theirs, measure, desired effect keeping back. one circumstance, however, convinced not yet fully sensible superiority, so, intrepid degree well alarm safety people. one parties sallied out, there two men walking along beach, carrying canoe; shot fired drive sallying party back, struck near these men, threw sand gravel all over them. laid canoe down looked round few moments, took up again walked along, done under most ordinary circumstances. captain became impatient confined situation beach, besieged harrassed constantly natives, made bold risk excursion back upon island, show natives disregard them, and, same time, satisfy himself existence water. not any oppose him appear numbers; few persons seen behind trees, stealing along through thickets without any demonstration hostility. discoveries few unimportant; only place found water, old well, stagnant unfit use. huts entered, stores dry cocoa-nuts, preparation dried fish sea-moss. filled solicitude party beyond reach assistance, knowing other means safety than opinion which exist among natives invincibility, highly gratified, after hour's watching, see returning old place blockade--the coral bank. now sundown, surf increased much not believe possible boat reach shore return safety; send men there without prospect enabled return, useless sacrifice lives; here people shore; natives followed return beach; remaining after dark probably attended most serious consequences. two men, who good swimmers, came forward volunteered services take shore light boat had, although felt unwilling exercise authority performance hazardous service, happy accept generous offer. landed safety, boat deeply laden captain party, clung one hand quarter, swimming other, until after severe most doubtful struggle, emerged surf, almost filled water, soon afterwards alongside. thought there one more breaker pass, all perished. men byron's island stout, active, well made. all naked, covered scars. some wore skull-caps, grass, wreaths dry cocoa-nuts. ornaments rude, worn very few. consisted shells beads, made something resembled whalebone, worn long strings,--by some round waist, others round neck. hair long matted, complexion very dark. beard thin, curled upon chin, like negroes. few women came round canoes, who looked coarse, almost robust men. wore round loins small mat about foot wide, fringe bottom. few men tattooed, very slightly. canoes ingeniously wrought, great many pieces light wood, which laced together twine, made husk cocoa-nut; leaky keep one man baling constantly. very narrow, sharp both ends, small platform light wood, one side, keep upright. resembled canoes duke york clarence islands, rather narrower, made better workmanship. canoe sails, all these islands, mats straw grass. soon captain returned board, got underway, bade adieu byron's island, inhabitants, whose acquaintance productive nothing anxiety perplexity. run off w. s., three four hours made drummond's island, ahead, distant three four leagues. daylight, passed reef considerable extent upon n.e. end island, ran down upon west side it. approached shore, within distance league, canoes made appearance every direction, sailing off us. stood in, found anchorage within two cables' length bank coral, stretched one two miles shore, which, low water, almost every dry. here hove to, sight, along shore, twenty thirty large villages, besides other habitations, thickly interspersed amongst trees beyond it. island, indeed, swarming inhabitants, and, extent forest cocoa-nut trees, seemed well adapted sustain large population. low, quite level, promised poor prospect affording supply water. not long hove to, before surrounded one two hundred canoes, each them, few exceptions, two men woman, latter whom kept constantly employed baling water out. betrayed greater degree timidity than natives any island seen before, keeping canoes, distance us, approaching, caution distrust. length some got board, others hung upon sides vessel, talking exchanging cocoa-nuts, flying-fish, old nails, pieces tin. one them, interesting looking youth, noticed one seamen, who made him several presents, other respects, treated him very kindly. youth appeared sensible favour shown him, expressed gratitude smiles, repeatedly patting sailor shoulder; but, after dumb show going some time, patron's face turned him, snatched hat head, jumped overboard it, making way expeditiously possible nearest canoe. canoe took him in, pulled off dead windward us, until out reach, although threw several shot over heads, convince danger encountered such bold adventures. first stopping place, ran down few miles, followed all canoes, which joined many more. some natives again came board, one man, whom captain made presents, seized upon fixture waist-boat, abruptly took leave. suddenly saluted charge bird-shot, pistol, manfully clung prize, bore off triumph canoe. aided companion, playing same trick, fellow who stole sailor's hat. few shot over heads brought to, lay down bottom canoe, until lowered boat, sent them. saw boat approaching, took paddles, made effort escape; but, finding impossible, jumped overboard, continued diving one side canoe other, until taken. trembled excessively, expressing great deal alarm, upon brought board, made several attempts escape. captain inflicted upon thief, punishment, thought useful admonition natives, future intercourse white men, when, companion, jumped overboard, apparently delighted, escaped well. number enterprising character people, changed purpose attempting obtain supply water, digging wells. and, besides above objection, expected that, performance duty, mulgrave islands, necessary explore whole group, where, within great compass, wants scarcely fail supplied. accordingly, evening, made sail, and, after clearing island, hauled up northward westward. inhabitants drummond's byron's islands, were, all respects, similar each other, even canoes sails, latter which coarse matting grass. during passage drummond's island mulgraves, which nine days' duration squally weather, constantly affected violent currents, which, irregular, allowance made. second day after departure drummond's island, safety considerably endangered cause. near chain small islands belonging kingsmill group, weather thick squally, stretched off, calculating that, meridian, following day, thirty miles northward them; but, surprise, meridian weather cleared, got observations, instead thirty miles northward, much south, carried through current night. two three days vicinity mulgraves', laying night, drifting current nearly much advanced through day, light baffling winds. evening november, nineteenth, welcome hail \"land! ho!\" given, shortly afterwards seen deck, two leagues off. proved easternmost mulgraves', which run down following morning, anchored lee shore, within less than cable's length surf, six fathoms water. island low, coral formation, and, all respects, resembled caroline, clarence, york, byron's, drummond's islands. inhabitants not numerous, differed all seen before dress manners. gave most kind hospitable reception, freely offered whatever any expressed wish for, all respects acquitted themselves manner highly satisfactory. near landing place satisfaction find two three old wells water, which, after cleared out, afford supply without much labour getting off, landing tolerably good. twenty-first twenty-second november, filled water-casks, and, several parties, explored island. search found whaler's lance, several pieces old canvass; all efforts obtain knowledge, whence came, persons who brought them, unavailing. some natives came board, all whom neatly ornamented. wore wreaths flowers round heads, bracelets necklaces beautiful shells; large roll leaves, one two inches diameter, through slits ears, covering loins, two bunches kind grass, resembled hemp, hanging below knees, one bunch behind, other before. nothing stolen them. behaved most orderly manner, looking round deck inquiringly, seated themselves, chatted familiarly people, taking pains make themselves understood. look action appeared lively intelligent; whenever subject visit pressed upon them, pointing whaler's lance, became silent, pretending ignorant meaning. activity exploring parties, traversing all parts island, close examination every thing amongst them, belonged whites, produced sensible alarm third day; and, besides desertion habitations some them, large canoe missing, departed island during night. beyond us, south west, range islets, far see masthead, thoroughly explored island, anchored, completed watering, made such repairs upon vessel necessary, determined proceed further direction. anchorage here wind several times changed blowing off shore, which, not room ride shore anchor, made it, upon such occasions, necessary get underway, stand off. such times, remarked, particular satisfaction, advantage possessed vessel, schooner rigged, none fore after could, same facility, performed delicate operation getting underway, crawling off, riding upon lee shore, within few fathoms rocks, touched which inevitably attended shipwreck. upon island, besides cocoa-nut, there few bread-fruit trees, growing great luxuriance. golden yellow fruit, which females nooaheeva ornamented necks, grew here greatest abundance, eaten natives almost constantly, who called bup. species small rat, tuft hair upon tail, very numerous, tame, hundreds constantly feeding about huts. first land approached proceeding southward westward, narrow islet, made up dry reefs, verdant spots, one two miles long, two hundred yards wide. most islets grew cocoa-nut, bread-fruit trees,--the invariable indication inhabitants. were, however, thinly inhabited. some reefs connected covered water sufficiently passage boat. captain landed upon eastern extremity, found few people, most whom fled approach, such remained, timid, hardly look upon countrymen near neighbours natives, who treated much kindness anchorage. small canoe came off, paddled one man, who ventured board, looked round few minutes, departed, without seeming any other object view than gratify curiosity. suspected him spy, not believed these people too simple, adopt such expedient civilization. we, however, afterwards ascertained capacity which came, sent principal chief all mulgrave group. schooner coasted along islands, keeping way captain, who continued westward, examining all parts it. beyond, afterwards ascertained inland sea great extent; several large sail canoes discovered coming distant islet. captain crossed reef into inland sea, found water smooth, every filled shoals coral. without indicating wish examine canoes, which caused put back, soon afterwards returned board, another boat sent continue examination islet, advanced. officer prevailed upon some natives, met with, come near him, one gave him, return present, some glass beads. upon arriving western extremity islet, captain put off shore, found four large canoes hauled up beach, those seen before, coming over inland sea, just act landing. afterwards ascertained, high chief mulgrave group, fifty hundred chiefs warriors, cruise observation, satisfy himself who, were, object visit lonely unfrequented isle. none chiefs any thing distinguish them, knew not here upon some ordinary pursuit, otherwise, presence excited much more lively interest. was, gratified opportunity seeing many natives, canoes, which examine, proofs crew globe landed upon these islands, which already pretty well satisfied seen. fact satisfactorily proved few minutes afterwards, discovering upon platform canoes lids several sailors' chests. farther examination, pieces cloth ash-spars also found. natives watching every look motion, notwithstanding pretended apathy indifference, not conceal intense excitement close examination produced amongst them, soon gave rise animated conversation, which accompanied angry looks, only satisfaction gave us, pointed chest-lids, vacant stare, few words island language not more intelligible. not far beach pleasant grove cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees, through which scattered number neat little indian huts. one them, near shore, frequented great many natives, whom people freely mingled. about ten feet high, above ground; small garret, which screened observation floor sticks, thickly interwoven leaves. although most huts examined men, good ill fortune, this, many constantly assembled, escape observation. there found one men, afterwards informed us, whom anxiously looking; discovery attended bloodshed, and, perhaps, fatal consequences shore party, than whom natives much more numerous. william lay, one globe's crew, brought islet, chiefs, used circumstances suggest. concealed garret hut, guarded number old women, who directed, first whisper noise made, put him death, chiefs also denounced heaviest vengeance upon him, should, any way, disclose secret there. lay unhappy situation several hours, listening interchange opinion amongst countrymen, whose conversation informed character vessel, object cruise. towards sun-down, parties weary labour day, repaired board night, natives, getting into canoes, took departure islet, steered away, over inland sea, until lost horizon. stood off during night, and, nine morning, anchored nine fathoms water, near place landing. here there channel into inland sea, nearly water enough schooner, through which made unsuccessful attempt pass. situation now becoming very unpleasant. necessary parties shore, exploring islands, remainder crew quite insufficient get vessel underway,--an expedient indispensable, whenever wind came shore, anchorage hardly ever extended more than half cable's length it. lose nothing delay want perseverance, however, soon after came to, officer, party eleven men, attended boat take over drowned reefs, sent march round, explore islets, formed continued chain southward westward us. felt conviction, conduct natives, unwilling give intelligence required, depend entirely upon industry good fortune, any discovery make. evening sent boat communicate party, advanced far, she returned without seeing any them. following day, november twenty-fifth, weather clear pleasant, boat sent refreshments our exploring party, who overtaken distance ten miles us, just commencing morning's march. islets, thus far, narrow, not averaging quarter mile breadth, thinly inhabited. our party pleased conduct natives seen. gave cocoa-nuts, without receiving any thing return, evening, stopped repose night, provided huts sleep in. officer party, course day's march, found mitten, name rowland coffin marked it, who, referring list globe's crew, proved one boys left mutineers. place party found, extent island not seen. landed settlement anchored, found hats nearly all deserted. such natives, remained, seemed disposed very friendly, followed beach, shot few sand-snipe, which drew loud shouts applause, witnessing effect musket. near huts observed number small white cranes, one which shot, supposing wild, afterwards regretted very much, learning domesticated, held great reverence natives. five morning, november twenty-sixth, squall arose eastward, which struck vessel adrift, direction trending land, and, dragging off bank, hove anchor up, stood along shore westward. run fifteen twenty miles, came up our party, whom sent refreshments, proceeded on, passing several remarkable points. three, p.m., came to, under point, which somewhat protected sea, ten fathoms water, about thirty fathoms coral rocks, there three feet. considerably advance our party, whom now determined march round whole circle islets, information mutineers not sooner obtained. front islet wider than any seen elsewhere, presented noble forest cocoa-nut, interspersed every broad green leaves bread-fruit tree, which indicated most luxuriant growth. huts scattered about through trees, some close shore, forming peaceful romantic scene. landing good low water, practicable high tide. far see westward, land still continued. surgeon, who very much debilitated, sailed coast peru, gradually, almost imperceptibly, become more feeble, some time past believed disease liver. until within two days coming our present anchorage, discharged ordinary duties, attending sick, mind began fail, evident period existence near close. lay time state insensibility, receiving little aid friends afford him; forty-five minutes after four, p.m., november twenty-seventh, breathed last, deeply lamented all crew, whom greatly endeared himself, kind assiduous attentions, even extremely ill, knew fast hastening close life. morning, took party men shore, grove, foot wide-spreading bread-fruit tree, made narrow bed our departed messmate. nine, vessel struck adrift, dragged off bank. she again stood towards shore, landed, many officers men spared bury doctor's remains, honours war. natives assembled, number twenty thirty, followed grave, watching all our motions expression great surprise. silent until first discharge musketry, burst into loud shouts laughter, which drove back, threats punishment, considerable distance us, afterwards remained quiet. foot head grave planted seeds orange, lemon, cheramoya, upon bread-fruit tree, head it, carved name, rank, vessel which belonged. below spiked, firmly upon tree, brass plate, name, age, vessel which belonged, day death inscribed upon it. little eastward grave satisfaction find two springs excellent water. following morning our party arrived, and, after receiving refreshment, continued northward westward. crossed long reef, connected islet abreast another, distance few miles, appearance large settlement, immense cocoa-nut forests rose direction. soon after crossing reef, arriving extreme east end islet, narrow sandy, suddenly came place strewed several hundreds staves beef pork barrels, old pieces canvass cloth. advancing little further, found skeleton, lightly covered sand, box, containing few spanish dollars. natives, some whom constantly following our party, occasionally mingling them, administering, well their wants, upon approaching place disappeared, seen distance, skulking through bushes. these discoveries excited liveliest expectation soon making others more satisfactory, proceeding mile further, found unoccupied hut, where, night approaching, encamped. early morning took up their line march, not gone far, evident natives preparing hostilities. groups frequently seen distance, armed spears stones, holding animated discussions. much more numerous than our party, who, upon examining their ammunition, found wet, few arms had, which other than pistol, each man, also wet, unfit immediate use. officer, therefore, determined retreat place night's encampment, until despatch information situation, ask reinforcement ammunition. arriving spent night, found hut occupied gone, also large sail canoe, left there, taken away. not single person any seen. here remained, sending two party schooner, which now several miles him. little after meridian, received board, heard, great interest, information gave. there no doubt our minds, place mutineers, others globe's crew, left,--but now?--was question, which naturally occurred us. given natives no cause, excite hostility; but, contrary, taken every means suggested itself, gain their confidence esteem. wished make war upon us, opportunities frequently presented, our exploring party assailed overpowering numbers, prospect success, which not availed themselves, here now apparently wavering between peace war, just moment our discovering place our countrymen been. knew not account change their conduct, supposing mutineers amongst them, that, our near approach, becoming alarmed their safety, roused natives war, hope defending themselves open combat. supposition true, seemed very probable, situation our party very critical, no time lost giving aid asked for, renewing our search redoubled activity. launch hoisted out, fitted all possible expedition, four, p.m., november twenty-ninth, sailed two officers eleven men, together three belonging party, all willing spare schooner, bold attempt upon large party natives, led enterprising desperate chief, placed lives all crew greatest jeopardy. crossed reef, which sufficiently overflown high tide, admit it, ran down inland sea encampment our party, arrived eight evening, found all safe; looking our appearance, greatest anxiety. allowed boat's crew land, get their supper company those shore, preparatory commencing their night's work. prepared our departure, embarked, greatly chagrined examining boat, find shore party, whom brought fresh arms ammunition, had, their over-anxiety well supplied, deprived part mine, under necessity landing, searching, not only men, even bushes, before found them. our party acquired no information since morning, discoveries already made, felt satisfied, following day, find other traces mutineers. taking departure, stretched off fine breeze, blowing directly point which wished steer. suffered men lay down refresh themselves sleep, whilst midshipman s. myself steered boat, regret, returning back towards shore whence started, discovered lost ground; besides, our boat clumsy badly fitted, found contend strong current. got oars out, therefore, pulled dead windward until day-light, proceeded about six miles, again made sail northward eastward, close haul upon wind; gradually veered, until head island eight ten miles us, which just appeared above horizon, designed land give men breakfast. within two three miles island, observed number canoes leaving places nearer landing upon it. two canoes put off thence, standing beating clumsy boat weather intervening coral reef; manned about twenty natives, all armed spears stones. approached pretty near, passing under lee, ran alongside examine them, which gave great many cross looks. soon suffered depart, immediately returned shore whence came, not long afterwards discovered about twenty canoes carry twenty forty men each. canoes boarded, sailed least three miles one, now discovered impossibility possessing ourselves mutineers globe, whilst they, natives, friendly, them, disposal such fleet vessels, which avoid whenever our too near approach endangered their safety. determined, therefore, take possession all now assembled, even though opposed natives, reduced necessity measuring our strength them. island small, producing few nut trees, small number huts upon it, notwithstanding which, there several hundreds people assembled;--a great crowd, considering thinly populated state islands. large assemblage only brought together some extraordinary cause, determined land search their huts, look round, before made wide breach them, necessarily result seizure their canoes. sorry see, our coming near them, sending their women children towards huts, which short distance assemblage natives; movement indicated want confidence their part, still less agreeable us, disposition hostility. there some surf shore about land near canoes, boat more readily our disposal occasion after landing, dropped anchor, the act veering through the surf, when, astonishment, person dressed looking like native, addressed our own language. standing upon the beach thirty forty yards distant, half way between the natives, all whom seated themselves. the first words understood, were, \"the indians going kill you: don't come shore unless prepared fight.\" the scene now presented us, inspired indescribable sensation; for, although convinced one the men anxiously looking for, sudden unexpected appearance, wild attire, above all, warning, seemed like illusion fancy. hair long, combed up, tied knot the top head; round loins, wore large mat, finely wrought, the use cocoa-nut oil, the action tropical sun, nearly two years, made skin almost dark the natives. earnestly repeated, several times, not land unless prepared fight, described the plan the natives concerted him, which was, prevail upon come shore seat ourselves amongst them, when, given signal, all rise knock the head stones. statement probable enough, the suspicion one the mutineers, very naturally occurred our minds, the questions, \"why not found him before? and, not now fly protection, innocent?\"--forgetting our contemptible numbers precluded all idea safety him, opposed the numerous assemblage natives whom surrounded. asked name, which told william lay, one the crew the globe. stature juvenile appearance, answered the description him. told him come the boat, said afraid the natives, who directed him not advance any nearer us. then directed him run protect him; declined, saying, the natives kill him stones before could get there. during all time, thought arranging their plan come shore, called out frequently him know said; which, replied way calculated suit purpose. after discharging re-loading our pistols, one which cartridge-box each man provided, landed, marched up the place lay standing. still doubting whether not more foe than friend, determined that, under any circumstances, not escape, received him left hand, presenting, the same time, cocked pistol breast. not insensible the sentiment harsh reception calculated inspire; circumstanced was, could not risk every thing preference inflicting momentary pang, keenly felt. repeated the question, \"who you?\" which replied, \"i man,\" burst into tears. told him then say the natives, rose their seats, threw stone, shoot all; the poor fellow, delirious joy the moment, knew not said, and, instead obeying command, called out half english, half island language, broken sentences, most which unintelligible us; amongst other things, exclaimed, \"they going kill me, going kill me.\" ordered him silent, then asked, told going kill him.--recollecting himself immediately, begged my pardon, declaring knew not saying. time, some the natives risen, becoming very animated violent their conversation gestures. two three advanced towards us; pointed my pistol them, made lay repeat my threat, which the desired effect all one old man, who, unarmed, advanced defiance me. lay desired suffer him approach, which did, taking hold lay's hand both his, asked countrymen going him. lay explained him, few words, clearly could, which the old man seemed much affected. benefactor, the person whom indebted life; the poor fellow seemed not wanting sensibility gratitude, the moment their parting. embraced him affectionately, told him see him again before departed, wept like child. unwilling remain longer than absolutely necessary, lest the natives, recovered their first surprise, conceive contempt our small number, make trial our strength, which knew much superior us, determined brave, the first discharge our pistols place upon equality the same number ourselves. therefore cut short lay's interview friend, hastened him the boat; there wept joy, gave several proofs the agitated state mind. first impulse, which great credit heart, was, inquire friends well, then recollecting probable none knew them, told belonged east saybrook, connecticut, asked any acquainted section the country. several times repeated the same questions, forgetful asked before, replied the negative. mind little composed, made inquiries him respecting the rest the globe's crew, who left the island; which answered, all dead except cyrus h. huzzy, who island few miles windward us, now full sight. asked, expression great solicitude, go huzzy, told him would, seemed afford him not less pleasure than own deliverance. stated huzzy both knew search them, our vessel man war. said the chiefs sent spies board the schooner every day practicable, who communicated the number guns carried, and, within very few, the number which the crew consisted. apprised the force conduct our exploring party, descending the minutest particulars, even describing most the individuals board. seriously debated the question making war upon several times, always consulted lay huzzy the propriety it, probably their prospect success. dissuaded it, course, filled apprehension, declaring, repeatedly, invincible, there scarcely any thing could not accomplish our six-pounders; even made believe, trifling our armament was, could sink the islands our cannon: ready the human mind receive truth cannot comprehend, recommended superior intelligence, though variance every thing nature reason. the natives told let go pleased, without molesting any way, give whatever asked for, and, all times, show themselves friendly us. strictly pursued the course conduct pointed out the young white men, whose superior knowledge our prowess, placed every reliance; still doubted the probability conciliating our friendship the sequel, adhered tenaciously the idea accomplishing our destruction some way, make their own security the more certain. object, variety plans submitted different times, lay huzzy, those amongst the chiefs esteemed the wisest bravest, all which discouraged, the success such undertaking any way, frequently declared utterly hopeless. one their plans was, get alongside night, unobserved, some the sharp instruments obtained the globe, make hole the bottom the vessel, sink her; when, very truly believed, those who not drowned, easy prey them, the party shore, unaided the schooner, soon overcome destroyed their superior numbers. another their plans, the most plausible one, was, assemble secretly all the canoes the islands, some point not distant us, approaching under cover the night, surprise board us. last plan put into execution, dark night, possible succeeded, could hardly seen time use our cannon, the fire musketry which heard before, probably not driven back advanced near us, particularly if, apprehended, night, the fire not directed effectively. not found entirely unprepared; for, under the impression the mutineers still living, terms friendship the natives, the lookout such attempt made, seemed the only means which could possibly escape, the plan which most naturally occur desperate men their situation. advancing towards the island expected find huzzy, lay told the island found him favourite place fishing particular season, numerous shoals fish swam upon shore. our schooner anchored the place residence the high chief, who, those found assembled upon the small island, fled there avoid us. the boat's crew oppressed fatigue hunger, landed upon dry reef, after proceeding few miles give rest refreshment. painful witness lay's anxiety depart, who, fearing messenger despatched the chief who huzzy custody, kept eyes fixed upon anxious, hurrying look, several times expressed fears the chiefs the boldness attempt rescue. finishing our frugal repast, pulled up under uninhabited point lugoma's island, (this the name huzzy's chief,) which, passed without observation, ample bay, upon the shore which situated the village the chief, opened our view; and, our great joy, the only sail canoe possession, seen hauled up the beach. few moments, no one seen; the act landing, lugoma several old women came walking down the beach, attracted the strange unexpected appearance our boat. struck the utmost consternation beholding lay, who still native dress; the old women began calling out, loud tone, demanding him there, wanted. before time reply them, got out the boat, taking, hold lugoma, pointing pistol him, bade lay say him, unless huzzy brought immediately, kill him. begged not hurt him, said huzzy near come me. the old women, alarmed the safely the chief, instantly ran off, calling aloud huzzy. few minutes before appeared, walking towards us, fine yellow hair hanging ringlets about shoulders, person quite naked, the exception piece blanket, tied round loins. approached sufficiently near, said him, \"well, young man, wish return country?\" eyes filled tears replied, \"yes, sir; know nothing done which afraid go home.\" soon lugoma felt relieved apparently dangerous situation, began express solicitude huzzy, begging not hurt him; assured no injury intended towards son, called huzzy, entreated not take him away. the old women united the chief the expression their wishes, seemed, their loud talk significant gestures, insist upon the white man's remaining them. the scene interesting one, found picturesque group assembled beautiful lawn, front number huts, surrounded cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees. huzzy owed life the native chief; the condition slave him two years. him indebted many acts kindness, some which requited industry service, some cancelled harsh treatment; yet, still stood delicate situation towards the chief. the saving his life alone, conferred obligation upon him, which could scarcely repaid long faithful services. the chief evidently appeared regard him his son, the moment our departure arrived, saw determined take our countryman us, joined tears entreaties, saying weep long bitterly him. told huzzy come back again, asked bring him. the only way which could get clear strange petition, urged much feeling, promised bring him back his mother consented his return. this, appeared tolerably well satisfied, about returning the boat, lugoma took huzzy aside talk him privately. their interview ended, asked huzzy the chief saying him; which replied, reminding him difficult him get along his work without him, return soon could, bring him some axes, guns, cloths, such his countrymen wore. \"i promised bring them,\" said he, \"when return, quite satisfied.\" ready depart, conciliate the good the female part lugoma's family, presented variety trifles, such finger-rings, glass beads, &c., which, return, loaded profusion small mats, rude shell ornaments, accompanied many expressions thankfulness regard. came take leave lugoma, presented him jack-knife. the exception axe, could given him nothing more valuable, gained his unreserved confidence. immediately proposed going the schooner, got into the boat his son, lad eight years old. huzzy took him musket bible, the only things saved the massacre. the first preserved him the chief, who thought huzzy's hands, although no powder, match all his enemies; the bible clung himself, kept the companion his lonely hours. the bible more object curiosity the natives than any thing else found the possession the white men: often inquired huzzy was, use, &c., his explanations seemed only increase their superstition aversion it. never pleased see him retire the garret his little hut, read it, his custom; invariably remonstrated him against it. urged him frequently destroy it, refused, threatened themselves. the reason their dislike, said bring spirits round the house kill hurt some the family. huzzy told them, destroyed it, the great spirit come kill all; which probably indebted preservation. walking, back the huts, over level green spot, enclosed cocoa-nut trees, lugoma came great haste, disturbed look beckoned come away, the same time saying huzzy, not go there: place the dead; my presence disturb them, bring spirits round his huts; indulged his superstition, walked off. lugoma about thirty years age, moderate stature, square built, low forehead, flat nose; expression countenance indicated intelligence enterprize. huzzy gave him the character very passionate, inveterate his enmities, fierce determined his hostility, firmly attached his friends, possessing benevolent heart. often became offended huzzy, their ordinary occupation, upon such occasions use violent language, sometimes threaten kill him; but, his passion subsided, very sorry said, soothe huzzy telling him not afraid; not hurt him. once, however, working their canoe, something went wrong, raised paddle struck huzzy it, upon which, the poor fellow, slave was, gave way his indignant feelings, the act repaying the chief's violence interest, who, seeing gone too far the high-spirited white man, his life menaced, begged him not strike, declaring never again raise his hand against him; the quarrel amicably settled huzzy's telling him, ever did, kill him. story, thought there some truth the one which huzzy told one day related him lugoma's son, the boy the boat us. mulatto lad board the schooner, the time our contemplated capture spoken amongst the natives, little boy told huzzy his father going save the life the mulatto boy, then kill him getting too large. the mulatto boy great favourite amongst the natives, upon several occasions, quarrels arisen amongst the chiefs who him, the presence lay huzzy debating the question our capture. the day far advanced left lugoma's island, stood along the shores the islets intercept the land party whom met no very great distance, making rapid marches. landed inform our success, their labour end, which could not rejoice us, although extremely disappointed not themselves the fortunate persons, after all the toil experienced the search. put off made sail both our boats, the canoes all still upon the beach the island whence taken lay, intended land get his musket, which, the hurry our departure, forgotten. no sooner, however, the natives see both our boats standing towards them, than put off all their canoes, bore away directly before the wind. made all sail chase, soon perceived leaving very fast; and, night coming on, made the experiment few musket shots, fired over their heads, the hope bringing to. instead answering the desired purpose, served only increase their alarm, the weather becoming squally, suffered depart without further pursuit. cause regret fired; the first discharge, poor lugoma the greatest agony, fear going kill him, well the rest the chiefs. all the explanations lay huzzy could make, all their assurances my friendship, could not quiet him. several times taken his son jumped overboard, allowed him so. whenever went the stern the boat sitting, repeated again again my good friend, not kill him; my replying not hurt him, his friend, &c., not the least effect; only caused him again repeat before told of, his my friend, not kill him. the numerous shoals coral, the violence the wind, rendering somewhat dangerous run the dark, determined come the night, yet long distance the schooner. purpose, stood towards the place where, the preceding night, met the exploring party. lugoma no sooner found himself near the shore, than became more earnest than ever his petition be permitted land his son, although more than twenty miles his home. allowed him leave us, not apprehensive the hostility his countrymen; knew not his aid piloting our night's encampment, be surprised before morning, my resolution keep him confirmed, reported me, some omen who landed the other boat, one more natives seen near us, skulking through the bushes. also determined, not trust ourselves shore, lay the boat, make awning our sails, screen the heavy showers frequently coming over, the best manner could.--when finished our repast, hauled off anchored, not sleep. our awning poorly calculated shelter, the showers constantly succeeded each other, kept too wet cold rest; besides this, frequently reminded lugoma's presence, who made pay dearly his detention. lay no else than alongside me, during the whole night, not more than ten minutes elapsed any one time, not move his hand over my face, thought my attention sufficiently awakened, call out me, \"hitera;\" word signified my good friend, nor suffer rest moment afterwards until replied him \"hitera.\" anchored short distance the place the chief mutineer the globe his murderous companions landed--where fallen their hands, they, their turn, been killed savages. spot, calculated revive, the minds lay huzzy, the liveliest recollection sorrows sufferings, no language could describe; all wished hear account the mutiny, the events subsequently transpired, desired lay favour the relation. lay's narrative follows: \"the first heard discontent board the ship, few days previous the mutiny. went the maintop-mast-head, found comstock; after few moment's conversation, said me, 'what do, william? bad usage: take the ship, run away?' did not make much any answer. not now remember said; quite inexperienced, my first voyage. the afternoon, the next morning, heard him talking some the men the forecastle about running away him arrived funning's island, which, believe, then steering. this, suppose, the purpose sounding them, find out their disposition, who join him the mutiny.--from heard, began think all not right, tried get the news aft, unfortunately did not succeed. the afternoon, before the night which the mutiny took place, the main yard furling the mainsail, tried then tell the second mate, paine comstock between us, afraid say any thing. comstock had, some days previous, taken his cutlass the cabin into the forecastle; boat-steerer, used eat the cabin the officers. knew nothing more about until twelve one o'clock the night the mutiny took place; sleeping the forecastle, rowland coffin came awoke me, saying come upon deck, taken the ship. got up went aft, all the crew mustered the quarter-deck. comstock told had done, his regulations were, said, such not swear stick him, go the other side the deck. did not know many engaged the mutiny, believing be killed did not swear, all swore stick comstock obey his orders. then told haul the third mate up out the cabin; one had take hold the rope made fast him. laid him the gangway, thought dead; comstock throwing him overboard, clung the ship his hands. comstock told some one bring axe cut his hands off, let go went overboard. saw him the water astern, swimming after the ship some time. then made sail; comstock the only navigator board. first went the kingsmill group, did not like stop there, the natives very numerous thievish; besides, comstock had shot one stealing something; after which, afraid stay amongst them. drummond's island, the kingsmill group, came directly the mulgraves, made part them, anchored commenced landing the stores. \"the crew the globe consisted between twenty-five thirty; the only persons engaged the mutiny comstock, paine, oliver, the black steward, (lilliston, who one the mutineers did not mention.) midnight, previous descending the cabin, one the number placed sentinel the cabin door, axe, comstock saying young brother who the helm, did not keep the ship course, kill him soon came deck. comstock killed the captain striking him the forehead axe whilst sleeping, first locked the mates up their state-rooms, not escape. then went the other mutineers, and, believe, cut the throats the first second mates, shot the third mate. did not see any the third mate, told the others thrown out the cabin windows. \"not many days after the mutiny, the black steward detected the cabin loading pistol which forbidden pain death; asked comstock intended it, replied, first, \"nothing;\" but, questioned more closely, said had heard smith some one else say, intended take the ship. smith the other person named the steward, called up comstock, asked had threatened take the ship; which replied the negative, insisting had never intimated intended any thing the kind. comstock declared such offence could not go unpunished, the steward be tried court martial; thereupon told the steward choose one man, said choose another, the two sentence the steward such punishment the offence merited. the two men accordingly chosen, the steward selecting rowland coffin his advocate, comstock, paine his. after hearing the evidence, deliberating short time, found the steward guilty, sentenced him be hung the yard-arm until dead. immediately afterwards, all hands called witness the execution; the steward taken forward given fourteen seconds make his peace god.[9] the foretop-mast steering sail haulyards overhauled down tied round the steward's neck, comstock, after making every body take hold the haulyards, held the fourteen second glass one hand, his cutlass the other. the glass out, gave the signal the people run away the haulyards, striking the ship's bell his cutlass, and, moment, the criminal run up the yard-arm. \"after the death the officers, comstock made all live the cabin him, the mutineers used sing, carouse, tell over the story the murder, had dreamed. paine oliver, who could scarcely ever sleep, spoke horror their dreams, ghosts appeared night; comstock always made light it, appeared exult had done. said once, the captain came him his wounded bloody head, showed him had done, told the captain depart never come again, would kill him second time. \"after our arrival here, made raft two whale-boats some spars, the first second day, landed thirty forty barrels beef pork, sails, rigging, variety other articles, comstock pitched tent shore, commenced the mechanics work whale-boat going raise upon make larger. paine displeased his doing soon, sent word him had better discharge the ship, then work upon the boats. greatly enraged comstock, who hailed the ship boat, her sent him, came board. there paine had violent quarrel, paine dared him take musket go shore him fight out, which comstock refused do. landed, afraid paine oliver would kill him slept the tent, went off pass the night the natives; his absence, paine oliver agreed shoot him came back; accordingly, the following morning, seen coming along the beach alone, \"and had arrived within good gun-shot, commenced firing him; without changing his pace, continued advance, drawing his cutlass, called out paine stop firing would make peace him; paine, however, continued fire, and, the third fourth discharge, comstock fell lifeless upon his face, ball pierced his heart. fearing not be quite dead, perhaps would get up again, paine ran up him axe, cut off the back his neck. buried close the tent, the manner had often expressed wish be, all his clothes on, his cutlass hung his side. upon first landing, had fixed upon site town, amongst other public buildings contemplated erecting, church, which had selected considered eligible situation. \"the natives all the time very friendly, not the least afraid them. great many came our tent every day, some there day night, eating, drinking, sleeping us. paine had girl brought another islet, who did not like stay us, would run away whenever she got opportunity; fired muskets her several times, last, used keep her putting her irons. few days after the ship ran away, some the natives, who had been the tent, stole number tools. paine gave four five our people muskets without cartridges, sent the natives, great many whom assembled not far off, the stolen articles. the natives refused give up, soon began throw stones our people, who, knowing had not the means resisting, began retreat; the natives pursued them, throwing stones, one the party, rowland jones, either fell knocked down his pursuers, who came up immediately afterwards killed him. the party returned the tent, paine, who had taken the command after comstock's death, ordered all the muskets brought him, locked them up. all about the tent, few hours afterwards the natives came there usual, greater numbers. after had been there little while, some one remarked, 'i afraid going kill us; all got spears, stones, sticks their hands.' upon this, paine said believed all taken, safe. the words scarcely out his mouth, the natives commenced the massacre, knocking our people the head stones clubs, sticking spears them. old man his wife laid hold me, one each side, led little way off the bushes, where, thought going kill me, only held fast protected the violence several who came wanted kill me. saw two the natives lead paine off little way, thought going save his life; proceeded only few yards, one them took up stone struck him the head; attempted run, second blow brought him down, immediately afterwards killed him. oliver, did not see; the natives told ran short distance, overtaken killed the bushes. sandwich islander us, got the water, overtaken killed there.\" \"were there any women the massacre?\" \"oh, yes, children too. the women seemed take active a part the men. saw one old woman run a spear the back one man, who held two natives, a degree violence seemed far beyond her strength. thought all myself killed until the following evening. had been taken the islet schooner anchored, all the chiefs assembled, brought huzzy, show there one living besides myself. after interview a few hours, huzzy taken away live lugoma, who had saved his life, taken live the old man who had saved mine. very poor scarcely ever got enough eat the coarsest native food. had labour very hard, although suffered constantly hunger, which soon made weak extremely wretched. last, the high chief took compassion upon me, made live him; after which, had always plenty eat, liberty work not, pleased. very kind every respect. always brought huzzy me, taken see him once a fortnight, once a month, suffered pass the day together.\" here lay's narrative ended. huzzy told us, during his residence lugoma, his time had been spent principally the water, going him his canoe, which required two work it. lugoma a great fisherman, distinguished amongst the chiefs his industry enterprising character. would always enough eat, had steal it. huzzy would complain him the hard laborious life led, lugoma would always reply, would eat work. there seems be no doubt, the natives saved the lives these young men no other motive than making them slaves, availing themselves the advantage their labour. the dawn day, prepared depart the schooner, getting up our anchor, which a kedge, weighing upwards a hundred pounds, found hooked a bunch coral the bottom, which all our efforts failed move it. soon lugoma saw our difficulty, told his son go down clear the anchor. the little fellow jumped into the water, which about three fathoms deep, a few moments came up, making motions haul away. had disengaged the kedge, had no further trouble getting up. a universal practice amongst the natives, whenever wish anchor, take a line the end the canoe, tie a tree coral the bottom. the chief persisted his desire leave us, saying still afraid would kill him; had no object taking him against his will, consented his departure, presenting him some seeds, the culture which caused be explained him, also the value the fruit. our return board welcomed every body. had now accomplished the object our visit, the islands altogether void interest, except their novel formation, the singular habits the natives, well content leave them return some other place more congenial the feelings civilized men. before left, however, wished see the chiefs, after representing the impropriety their conduct toward the white men who had sought asylum upon their islands, point out the course future pursue towards such again visit them. the morning december the first, none the chiefs people residing upon the islet abreast returned, the mother the high chief directed send her son come back, bring him the rest the chiefs, without delay. made a visit the chief's village, i found few inhabitants, most whom women children. situated the side the island opposite us, bordering upon the inland sea. not extensive, a beautiful romantic spot; the grove cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees, through which scattered the huts the natives, ran about a hundred yards back the inland sea a wild thicket passes through the centre the islet, length two three hundred yards. here i found the largest canoe i had yet seen. large enough carry fifty men, old, leaked badly, the high chief compelled leave behind, his flight, all the rest. near the high chief's hut, came consecrated ground. the place burial the royal dead. a small space, comprehended within the circumference a few yards, the head each grave stood a cocoa-nut tree, bound round dry leaves,--a mark prohibited the use the fruit. accompanied a son the high chief, a child about twelve years old, who desired not tread the graves his ancestors. two graves pointed out, those chiefs, who had been highly distinguished, beside which stood the aged trunks cocoa-nut trees, indicated the period their demise been very distant. one the huts saw a domestic fowl, which, i expressed a wish purchase, the chief's son, whose name ladro, immediately presented me. afterwards saw a number others running wild the thickets. small, looked like what called the bantam. the natives never eat them, giving, the reason it, not cleanly their food. our return, lay took a place, where, after the massacre, had buried a spanish dollar. still there, took him a memento his captivity. passed several springs water, which the women banished a certain period. met a native, whom lay knew, who, assuming the native dress, went through the violent motions gestures a mulgrave man, engaged battle. indescribable mixture the frightful ludicrous. i apprehensive would offend the native: laughed the representation, said, very good. the following morning, december the second, disappointed not seeing the chiefs. the captain went again the high chief's mother, who made some excuse their not appearing, declared, would positively be up night moonlight. told her send them again, say, not there the morrow, would go after them, the consequence might be serious. the old woman seemed very much alarmed hearing such language, promised a faithful compliance the part her son. had the desired effect, the following morning, december the third, the chiefs all presented themselves the shore, near our anchorage. the captain, taking lay huzzy him, went shore meet them. told him, way opening the interview, his power, ready obey all his commands. required them restore a whale boat belonged the globe, a swivel, had taken the white men, lay's musket, all which cheerfully assented. then gave them, a proof his friendship, some cotton handkerchiefs, axes, a variety other articles, much more value them than those had taken. told them, white men would never come there hurt them, always be kind friendly them, whenever ships hereafter visit their island. that, other white men ever be similarly situated those had killed, take care them, some future time would be rewarded it. promised faithfully all told, regretted killed our countrymen. gave them a pair pigs, male female, which told them take great care of, increase the number much possible, forbidding them, pain our displeasure, kill any until again return, which might be no very distant period, although uncertain when. the surgeon's grave made a sacred spot the high chief, every thing about be held the same reverence the burial-place his forefathers. the high chief instructed, through the interpreters, the manner cultivating the fruits vegetables, the seeds which had given him great variety. some planted, all be under his especial care. the use the various kinds explained him, well their importance ships, might visit his islands, which would give him return them, axes, whatever else most valuable him. the fourth december, i obtained a boat, set off a visit lugoma, who, contrary his promise, had not yet been board. i took huzzy me, knowing would delight the chief see him. met a variety obstacles our passage, through the inland sea, did not arrive the islet the chief until the second day after our departure. stood into his bay the midst a heavy shower, notwithstanding which, soon saw us, himself son ran down the shore meet us, waded up the middle the water, extending their arms towards us, full roasted fish, which had taken a large quantity the preceding day. both them called huzzy, repeated expressions their happiness seeing him, and, a moment after struck the shore, the whole tribe old women welcomed us, their joyful exclamations. soon were out the boat, each one turn clung round huzzy's neck, embraced him the kindest manner. several different huts were large piles fish, amounting some thousands, which had been roasted preserve them. lugoma offered once accommodate the night, saying, had abundance room his huts sleep, plenty fish eat. the weather squally wet, which induced accept his offer. i wished, also, witness the manner which caught fish such quantities, another opportunity might not offer before i left the islands. soon the shower over, which lasted two three hours, lugoma went out, employed himself busily collecting breaking up dry wood, arranging his ovens stones, all might be readiness cook the fish soon were taken out the water. there a considerable shoal extending out the shore, opposite his huts, upon which the fish, their migrations along the islets came great numbers. the outer edge shoal had sunk, a few feet below the surface the water, a long line cocoa-nut leaves, which were dry, a reddish colour. one end the line leaves taken the shore, made fast, there a pen, built stone. the line then taken round upon the shoal semi-circularly, encompassing a considerable portion it, the space between the other end the line the shore left quite open. a school fish seen, the natives intercept them, driving them through open space, and, pressing forward, finally into the stone pen, which taken nets. after all the arrangements were made, lugoma another native, waded out beyond the line leaves, watch the schools fish, but, unfortunately, allowed them all escape; and, well ourselves, seemed be a good deal disappointed his bad success. what appeared be most remarkable about method catching fish, that, after inclosed, not pass under the cocoa-nut leaves, although there a depth several feet water between them the bottom. lugoma took the place had planted the water-melon seeds, i gave him the time our parting. had cleared mellowed the ground care, preparatory planting the seeds, which were already up, looked thrifty. i bestowed upon him a great deal praise, planted a variety other seeds, fruit vegetables, which promised abundant supply me, i again return. night came, the hour repose hand, i perplexed the difficulty providing our security against surprise treachery, without giving lugoma reason suppose did not confide his friendship, which i knew would infer, any particular watchfulness our part. i did not believe had reason apprehend danger lugoma any one else, were exposed it, had the means security, i determined not run any risk. three the men were sent sleep the boat, anchored off a short distance the shore, which lugoma told no one must approach. the rest were directed bring their arms shore, keep a lookout through the night, rotation. the arrangement made, had all lain down, except the man standing sentry, lugoma saw him, asked, there not room enough him lay down. answered evasively several times, a view satisfy the uneasiness expressed, lest should be thought wanting any respect hospitality; were last obliged tell him, the man keeping watch, see no one came hurt us. his mortification evident, remarked, reply, no one would come his island hurt us. expressed our full confidence his friendship, giving him the further information, our custom always some one the look-out. lugoma arranged mats upon the floors his huts all, invited lay down one side him, his wife daughter the other side. blew rained hard all night, the morning clear pleasant. set off a visit islet a few miles beyond lugoma. offered go us, dive a large shell-fish, found there; could not take him, without incommoding ourselves, declined his company. the islet uninteresting, hardly repay the trouble going it. covered a thick growth hard red wood, common most the low islands, wild bup. soon took our departure it, returned lugoma's islet, early hour the day. the first time, the mulgraves', i observed, one lugoma's huts, a drum, resembling those nooaheeva, small dimensions. i supposed instrument music, compliance my request, lugoma readily consented play it. calling his daughter him, bade her thump upon her hands, whilst sung, time the music, a few short lines, throwing himself a variety attitudes, alternately extending one arm, great vigour, drawing the other his breast. upon inquiring what the subject his song, told me, through huzzy, the massacre the white men,--a rudeness, i did not expect,--even the untutored lugoma. i declined any further display his musical powers. were preparing return board, lugoma came several times, saying, i might just well cut his throat, lake huzzy away him. \"i no one,\" said he, a distressed look, \"that equally capable assisting me, work my canoe, now, going away his musket, my enemies come kill me.\" finding, last, could not prevail upon leave huzzy, said, must bring him back very soon. that, were long absent, should not find him living. said, must bring him clothes, like ours; guns axes; should share the government his islet him, promising abundant supply us, all the fruits vegetables had planted. the old women had taken affectionate leave huzzy, requested take two three females my boat, their baskets fish, which were intended a present the high chief, land them upon the islet lived. consented so, and, after landing them, arrived board late the afternoon, the schooner run down the globe's anchorage, she now lying. the following morning lugoma made his appearance the beach, his little son, landed his canoe upon the opposite side the narrow islet. a boat sent bring them off. the chief stared wildly round, astonished, wondering every thing saw. very timid, and, notwithstanding our kind reception, appeared feel extremely doubtful his safety. his confidence a measure gained, however, gave him axe, a piece cotton handkerchiefs, some other trifles; left us, reminding me my promise return. not long after his departure got underway, ran back the residence the chiefs, where, ten, a.m., came our old anchorage. the captain went shore, two, p.m., december the eighth, returned board the high chief, two others. were shown every thing about the deck, without awakening much apparent curiosity. then beat quarters, let them see what a formidable appearance made, arrayed battle,--an appearance, truly ridiculous one accustomed the imposing effect a fine ship war, calculated excite our risibility, notwithstanding the seeming gravity assumed the occasion. the captain asked the high chief, did not wish hear one the cannon fired, which answered evasively, unwilling, i suppose, acknowledge his fears, had been a great warrior his time. the captain then told him, would one them fired, not afraid, which brought the chief a confession, dared not hear it. the chiefs brought a number presents the tamon,[10] called the captain, consisting principally mats. became tired remaining board, expressed a wish be sent shore, gratified them, got underway. the high chief's son, who had visited me a number times before, whom i had made presents trifling value, important him, came board his father, expressed a wish go me. his father gave his consent, perfectly willing should go; there great probability opportunity would never offer him return, i thought would be cruel take him his native islands, where, his father's inheritance, would be well provided for. late the evening got underway, the mulgraves, the last time. had surveyed all part the islands intervening between our first anchorage the globe's landing, now steered the eastward the bearings had previously taken. squalls wind heavy rain coming on, soon lost sight the land. the loud roaring the surf, off the extreme north-eastern point, well the heavy swell set immediately afterwards, apprised had cleared the group. the land sight the mast-head, the morning, ran down the eastern end the island, had first anchored, a convenient distance run along upon the weather side, taking hearings the end every base three four miles. near the centre the windward part the group passed a wide opening into the inland sea, not far which a reef considerable extent, a very high surf breaking. within a short distance the reef, saw the bottom plainly ten fathoms water. there no place the weather side the islands, possible land any degree safety. after passing the extreme northern point steered off, the trending the land w. s.; and, sun-down, were up the island, whence i had taken lay, sailed nearly round the group. here hove the night. the group mulgrave islands, called, form a circular chain narrow strips land, which no more than half a mile wide, inclosing within the circle inland sea, one hundred forty miles circumference, filled shoals reefs coral. every bounded the sea-side, a bank coral, protects the violence the ocean. bank generally extends a short distance the shore, goes off into unfathomable water. the chief's islet, buried the surgeon, wider than any other place about the group, upwards a cable's length, which, a low coral island, be considered good anchorage. the whole circle broken alternately into clumps, a few feet above the water, level low coral reefs, some which above high-water mark, some sufficiently low afford a passage boats. the clumps vary length, none them more than two miles long, without interruption a dry drowned reef. covered a thick growth bushes, trees small size, except the cocoa-nut bread-fruit trees rear their tall heads, wide-spreading branches. wherever these grow, the underwood disappears, the place the appearance old forest, cleared a pleasure ground, a few trees been left standing, the advantage their shade. the bread-fruit tree two kinds. one the same that, which found the society, sandwich, many other islands the pacific. no seed, only be produced cuttings the tree, shoots, spring up the roots. the other kind seminal, very much superior the first. not the bread-fruit season, were the mulgraves, much our regret, could not obtain any the seeds rare valuable plant. tree, general, attains a size considerably larger than the common bread-fruit. the leaf the bread-fruit tree strongly resembles the fig, any one, who seen the latter, would immediately recognise it, the resemblance, the fine rich foliage bears, growing luxuriantly. this far the most important production the mulgrave islands. the fruit not blasted, sometimes happens, there a great plenty the inhabitants. lasts, however, only a few weeks; be presumed, the natives have no way preserving it, a dried baked state, practised many the south sea islanders, none been seen us during our stay. the cocoa-nut tree next value the natives. this food there ample supply, unless the fruit blasted. the bread-fruit cocoa-nut, both fail the same year, the natives experience great distress, reduced the necessity living upon a fruit, call bup. commonly used the poorest people, small quantities the chiefs all times. grows upon almost all the islands the west pacific; but, wild, much inferior growing the trees, which have a clear open space around them. lay lived upon the wild bup a considerable time after the massacre, residing the poor old man, who saved his life, before the high chief took compassion him. a sweet taste, like the juice a green corn-stalk. bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, bup, the only food the inhabitants the mulgrave islands, except the season the year, great numbers fish taken. the industrious enterprising have abundant supply period; only whilst the season lasts, not the practice preserving them. the bup-tree the most remarkable all the vegetable productions the mulgrave islands. shipwrecked seamen, might be the means sustaining life, no other food could be found, and, a never-failing resource, ought be generally known amongst those, who navigate the pacific ocean. the tree generally grows twenty thirty feet high,--sometimes singly, more frequently small clusters. the diameter the body rarely exceeds six inches. a hard thick bark, the wood spongy, like the cocoa-nut tree. stands half a dozen a dozen roots prongs, which propped up two three feet the ground. the fruit exact resemblance a pine-apple. smell, ripe, first agreeable, but, powerful, soon becomes offensive. the taste the ripe fruit much the same effect--agreeable first, like a mellow, sweet apple, cloying nauseous the stomach, taken any quantity. the ripe fruit never eaten the natives the mulgraves. green, not considered a state be eaten, until a beard, which grows out alongside the stem, acquired a length four five inches. then be taken the tree, eaten raw, roasted between hot stones. the soft part the seeds (if i call them) alone palatable, the other part hard tough. the manner eating is, twist the soft part off the teeth, whereby the juice expressed. there little about the islands would excite the interest either the botanist naturalist. saw few flowers plants. the islands were swarming a species small rat, had a tuft hair upon tail. the natives spoke them very troublesome. throwing a small quantity food upon the ground, near one the huts, dozens them could be collected together a few moments. one the natives sick, the friends collect the hut, lying, chant over him, appease the offended spirit afflicted him. the same prescription given all diseases, which a tea, made herb found upon the island. death takes place, the friends the deceased assemble, mourn over the body, keeping until becomes very offensive. frequently, the midst their most bitter mourning lamentation, some the mourners intentionally say something calculated excite mirth, all burst out into immoderate laughter, their mourning were the affectation children, soon the humorous excitement passed over, again relapse into their mournful strain howling chaunting. the body be kept no longer, the day interment arrives, the grave dug, the corpse taken upon sticks, carried the friends the deceased, followed a large concourse, who move along without order, some one occasionally breaks upon their solemnity a humorous trick, which gives rise others, sets them all laughing. this soon again succeeded mourning. the body lowered into the grave, covered up, a little canoe, a sail it, laden small pieces cocoa-nut other food, been previously prepared, taken the sea-shore the leeward part the island, sent off, a fair wind, bear far away the island the spirit the deceased, may not afterwards disturb the living. this ceremony considered indispensably necessary, never neglected. the head the grave a cocoa-nut planted, the tree springs which, held sacred, fruits never eaten, times the greatest famine. their burial places usually a short distance back the houses, the females strictly prohibited going them. their marriages conducted little ceremony. a man fancies a female his wife, makes the proposal her, which, agreeable, applies her friends. meet, hold a consultation, the propriety the match, decide whether take place. the man's suit denied, nothing more said the subject. united, said be very faithful, jealous each other's chastity. lay huzzy related occurrence, took place during their residence the islands, which shows keenly a sense injury felt them, jealousy sometimes inspires them the most ferocious deadly revenge. a young man had taken a young woman a wife, whom supposed be a virgin. a very short time after she went live him, however, evident she pregnant, before the period which nature prescribed had elapsed, gave birth a child. the indignant husband took the infant mother's arms, her presence dashed head upon a stone front his hut. an act which, under other circumstances, would have suffered death, a custom the islands, forbidding the destroying human life; and, the female superior rank the man, the daughter a chief, believed would be punished. her friends were loud their calls justice upon the offender, until a council the chiefs called, the matter brought before them. after an investigation, the chiefs were satisfied, the woman had grossly imposed upon her husband, whom suffered depart without censure. permitted the men have many wives get; food very scarce, find difficult support one, there few, even the chiefs, who have more. the high chief the only exception this remark the time our visit. had six, one whom a particular favourite. latuano, the high chief the mulgraves, called the greatest warrior the islands had produced a long time. told us one his wars driven his islands, remained (i think) fourteen days sea his canoe, most the time out sight land. steered an island, which, according the tradition his countrymen, lay the west the mulgraves, and, after a great deal suffering, arrived there safety. the high chief this isle (south pedder's island) received him kindness, after had visited thirteen different islands the group,[11] sent him back the mulgraves a fleet canoes, a great many men. arrived there safety, conquered his enemies, the time our visit tributary the chief pedder's island, who had given him a daughter grand-daughter marriage. told us every few years the chief pedder's island, who very powerful very wise, sends a fleet canoes the mulgraves, tribute. lay huzzy were have been sent him, also the globe's whaleboat swivel. i particularly struck latuanos' strong resemblance general bolivar. his stature about the same, his face bore the same marks care serious thought, his attention not awakened any particular thing; and, animated conversation, the same vivid expression beamed his fine features, sparkling black eyes. i could not think, i looking him, general bolivar could be placed near each other, similarly dressed, would be difficult tell which the indian chief, which the patriot hero. the high chief absolute his authority, but, the administration justice, particularly the life an individual concerned, influenced passing judgment the opinion the chiefs most consequence.[12] like all other men, whether civilized uncivilized, have different grades rank their society, the high chief down the farthest remove relationship royalty. the different islets inhabited, partitioned off different chiefs, who acknowledge their subordination the high chief, sending him a part whatever grows, taken within the limits their government. send him a portion their cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, bup, the fish birds, may be caught themselves any their people. the high chief requires this the support his numerous family. besides his wives children, usually keeps a large number men about him, who go his canoe, perform other essential duties his service. several the principal chiefs also attendance, live him constantly. his family, there no ceremony, remind the common people their lowly condition. all eat, drink, sleep alike. dress, there nothing distinguish the chiefs the common people, except the former sometimes wear a mat comes down the knee, straw, finely wrought. this, however, i believe, only worn upon particular occasions. the men wear bunches grass hanging down before behind, such i have described our first anchorage, about the size appearance a horse's tail. those most common use, were a reddish colour; a few them were white. the bark which made taken a long running vine. the boys go quite naked until ten twelve years old, a dress similar the men put them. their ornaments consist shell bracelets necklaces, sometimes a string thorn put round the head; flowers, be obtained, often used instead shells. many the men, some the women have large slits their ears, through which put rolls leaves one two inches diameter. the women wear beautiful white straw mats, elegant workmanship, about two feet square, sometimes larger, bordered round the edge, one two inches, black diamond figures, worked coloured straw, died the husk the cocoa-nut. usually wear two these mats, one which behind the other before, tied round the waist a beautiful round cord braided straw. the ornaments the women the same those worn the men. have no manner worship. acknowledge the existence a great spirit whom call kenneet, who, say, make them sick kill them: look nothing good him, and, far i could learn, have no idea rewards punishments after death. have a sort conjurers amongst them, whose art entertain great reverence, whom place a strict reliance. them apply all cases great emergency. their art consists a large bunch straws, which fold double tie a great many different ways; if, after the straws thus folded, doubled, tied, they be drawn out without any manner entangled the one the other, the omen propitious; otherwise, the contemplated undertaking relinquished. the following morning again resorted to, until success promised. must never be tried the morning, only once the same day. the morning i took lay the natives, the chiefs had recourse this art before they would allow him speak us; they were promised good fortune, otherwise would have been concealed us. who cannot perform the mysteries this art, not allowed drink the same cup him who can. they had a great aversion hearing us whistle, particularly their houses, would invariably run up any our people they were whistling, a fearful look, beg them stop; saying, would bring spirits about the house would make them sick kill them. one them wronged another who died, they were enemies, never eats without throwing away a portion[13] his food appease the ghost the departed. a meeting had the chiefs shore, the captain remarked an old man the circle, whose name character asked lay huzzy; replied to, said, a stern manner did not like his face, meaning looked like a bad man. the old fellow, seeing himself the subject conversation, asked the interpreter what the captain saying about him. told, his countenance expressed the utmost dismay, a day two afterwards, died. there not a native the islands whom lay huzzy conversed, did not believe the captain's dislike killed the old man. they seemed entertain the most singular notions the captain's supernatural powers. the purpose ascertaining what idea the high chief entertained a god, the captain asked him several questions, which his answers were vague unsatisfactory. thought had conceived the right one, asked the chief who thought made thunder. after a moment's hesitation, looked the captain replied, \"i suppose make thunder.\" this satisfactory any thing could be made express. thunder believed produced the agency a superior himself, the captain conceived be infinitely his superior. not long after the massacre the white men, the natives were visited a disease caused their limbs swell, produced great distress amongst them; before unknown, they ascribed lay huzzy, who, they believed, had the power afflict them manner, had done be revenged the death their countrymen. they finally charged them it, threatened kill them, which, all probability they would have done, their superstitious fear some greater evil. their huts not, generally, more than ten fifteen feet, ten fifteen feet high. they divided into two apartments, upper lower; the lower open all round, without any thatching; the floor raised a little above the adjacent ground, covered over small pieces the cleanest whitest coral be found. the rafters small sticks laid across them the thatching, secured twine made the outer husk cocoa-nut, which the thatching also secured. the thatch the leaves palm cocoa-nut. the ceiling the lower room generally low, one must bend almost double get into it, remain, must be a lying sitting posture. the garret a floor sticks thickly interwoven leaves; higher than the ground floor, an air comfort. the natives keep their provisions it, all such things they would preserve the rats. they also sleep there wet weather. the floor, a hole left just large enough a person crawl through, far the sides the rats cannot get it. their canoes display the greatest ingenuity, i have no doubt, a civilized country, they would be ranked amongst the rarest specimens human industry, unassisted the rudest implements. the model most singular, differs all i have ever seen use, either the european american world. construction remarkable, many respects inconvenient, seems improbable the model should have had origin any other cause than the want suitable timber a more perfect structure. the depth a mulgrave canoe, common size, four five feet; length thirty forty. narrow a man scarcely stand it; perfectly flat one side, round the other. sharp both ends. the mast twelve twenty-five feet long, the sail, (a straw mat,) which bent a small yard, very large proportion the canoe. they always sail the flat side, have the mast a little inclined forward. supported shrouds a guy either end, which used pleasure give the mast its proper inclination. beating windward, instead tacking do, presenting the other side the boat the wind, they bring the other end the boat it, making the bow which before the stern. amidships there several light spars extending about ten feet over the round side, four over the other. across these smaller sticks, which securely lashed above below, over them made a platform. upon part which extends over the flat side, they have a small thatched cabin, which they store whatever they wish preserve getting wet, would conceal observation. the other part the platform intended keep the canoe upset; hard pressed carrying sail, several men sometimes get it, keep the canoe upright. they move through the water astonishing velocity, and, turning windward, no boats surpass them. although the natives had no other tools work than what they made shells, previous the visit the globe, every article their workmanship neat, highly polished though had been wrought steel. the construction their canoes, the keel-stern sternpost solid pieces hard wood, upon which they built up small pieces laid one above the other, closely seized the line cocoa-husk. the seams neither caulked payed, the canoe consequently leaks so much require one man bail constantly. the steerage very laborious; they have no rudder, the only means which they steer, a long flat paddle held the hands the helmsman. steer a large canoe blowing weather, requires the utmost strength six eight men. upon the outriggers platforms, along the masts, they arrange their spears, which always taken them, even upon the most ordinary occasions. the canoes also always ballasted a quantity round stones, weighing about a pound each, which forms a material part their armament. our carpenter several days work upon the canoe the high chief, caulking graving her. had completed his work, the high chief, after expressing his gratification, earnestly solicited the captain leave him the island; said would always provide him an abundance eat, no one should ever hurt him. this, according the high chief's standard, the most ample reward could promise useful services. the people the mulgraves general moderate stature, well made. their complexion not so dark the natives the duke clarence byron's island, their features more comely. they appeared us like a different race men. they have not the flat noses thick lips the low islanders, except two three persons saw would come under description. their hair long invariably combed out great neatness, tied the top their heads. their deportment modest manly, after one becomes a little accustomed their dress, they have always an air gentility. they have a fine majestic walk, which one would hardly suppose, considered their way everywhere paved sharp coral. after had given them the pigs, amusing see what apparent pleasure they carried them about their arms, nursing them much care tenderness, though they had been children, whilst the pigs, unused such treatment, were kicking scratching the naked bodies the poor natives, squealing away most lustily. had interfere keep the pigs killed kindness, finally prevailed upon the chief forbid their petted this style. not improbable that, a few years, the whalers may have occasion cruise, the vicinity these islands, find an abundant supply. hoped, however, until they become numerous, no navigator who may chance touch there, encourage the natives diminish their number. 4, a.m., the 9th december, took our departure the mulgrave islands, stood the westward. daylight, had lost sight the group, 10, a.m., made south pedder's island. stood a little too far the southward, were all day beating up weather the n.e. point, where, sun-down, hove the hope the following morning should be able effect a landing, get a sight the great chief, so celebrated amongst the people had just left. the 11th december, passed all the early part the day searching vain anchorage, hove to, a little after meridian, opposite a considerable bay, upon the shore which a native village, large forests cocoa-nut trees. the captain took huzzy the gig, and, followed another boat, pulled over a wide coral bank the village. a few people were attracted the shore the appearance our boats. they immediately conducted the captain the chief, who seated a mat the open air, front his hut. seemed little moved the unexpected appearance his visitors. a very old man, had a long white beard came down upon his breast. the natives stood round respectful silence, the old chief addressed the captain, whom he soon distinguished the person highest rank amongst the strangers. he spoke the same language the inhabitants the mulgraves, huzzy forbidden let him know he understood, listen attentively what he saying those around him. a time his intercourse the captain carried signs, huzzy overheard him say the natives, standing by, \"don't disturb them yet. wait until to-morrow, see what they going do. they look round here see what they find, trade a little, go board their vessel, sleep, to-morrow they come again.\" the captain told huzzy address some questions the chief his own language, seemed operate quickly an electric shock upon the natives, who stared wildly around him, each other, looks the utmost astonishment. the chief partially lost his gravity the sensation produced, not less surprised than his subjects. he asked huzzy, before answering the question put him, he had learned speak the language pedder's island. huzzy replied, he had learned the mulgrave islands, he had been two years. the old chief said, he had been informed two white men there, then fitting out a fleet canoes send after them. he expressed a great deal disappointment, had taken them away, saying, he would have had them brought his own island, treated them well. he asked, lay also board the vessel. the captain had taken shore a present the chief, a number trifles, he thought might be acceptable the natives. our people endeavoured obtain a quantity cocoa-nuts bup, which there the greatest abundance; the natives parted their fruit very reluctantly. finally the captain addressed the chief, upon the subject giving selling us a supply, he said,--no! his island thickly inhabited, produced no more food than necessary his people. that, were want cocoa-nuts bup, there were other islands, not far the westward, there an abundance, few people, he advised our going there speedily possible. upon asked, he had ever seen white men before, he replied,--yes; a long time ago there came a large vessel, which there were white men, who brought their forge shore, they remained several days. this, he said, the only instance. the young women were all sent away, concealed the thickets, upon a distant part the island, they remained during the whole day. amongst other presents made the captain the high chief, a battle-axe,--to him an article the greatest value. he received it, however, reluctance, expressing his regret, he had not his power make a suitable return so valuable a consideration, accompanying his apology a small present mats, cocoa-nuts, a preparation the ripe bup, had an agreeable sweet taste. after dark our party left the village, went the beach embark. they had already left the shore a few yards, some natives came running down, called them return, saying, the chief had another mat the captain. they landed, they were told, the mat the village, huzzy must go it. the captain, not choosing send the mat, put off again. a few moments two three other messengers came running the beach, calling the boat return. she had pulled a few yards the shore, they said the chief wanted huzzy go up the village the mat, he did not wish keep the axe, which he had sent back the captain, unwilling, supposed, lay himself under so great an obligation its acceptance implied. the captain refused take the axe, telling the messenger say his chief, what had given, never took back, and, this, left the shore returned board. the tide had risen considerably over the coral bank, the party found the surf somewhat dangerous returning, their boats nearly filled water. the dress general appearance these people, well their language, the same the natives the mulgraves. their canoes were also the same. saw only three four sails, which were hauled upon the beach. the power the great chief must, therefore, consist his dominion over other islands the northward westward him, there an almost connected chain several hundred miles, which, he undertakes an important enterprise, he must, a great measure, draw his resources. probably the object collecting forces the great chief, latuano visited so many islands during his exile his own, which he last restored foreign aid. eight the evening, made sail the northward westward, a fresh breeze the eastward. the weather clear, stood under easy sail all night. early the morning land discovered, bearing nearly west, soon afterwards more land seen the north. the last ibbitson's island, appeared be separate discovered first. not improbable, however, they connected coral reefs, were too distant us be observed. the land all low, had the appearance the mulgraves other coral islands. meridian, hove to, put off two boats. passed leeward the island, crossed a drowned reef, extended far the eye could reach the n.w., found ourselves an inland sea, which extensive quite smooth. part the island landed was about five miles long, a quarter a mile wide. upon the margin the inland sea, there were a number huts, landed, not an inhabitant could be seen. the huts had evidently been recently occupied. the island was covered abundantly cocoa-nut bup trees, a few the bread-fruit were here there be seen. the shore the inland sea the water was smooth unruffled, the humble neat dwellings the natives, scattered about amongst the cocoa forests, presented a scene quiet repose, peculiarly soothing the mind, contrasted the eternal war breakers the ocean side. had not been long shore before found a few old people, who had concealed themselves the bushes, and, although they were first afraid us, they became less timid, increased number, had presented them some pieces iron, a few old buttons. return, they gave us mats, fishing-nets, cocoa-nuts, bup, the last which they filled our boat. their dress language was the same the mulgraves, their habitations canoes were also the same. amongst all these islands, the natives ascend the cocoa-nut trees, the way i have described the marquesas. here saw several very old people, some whom had lost all their teeth,--a circumstance had not before remarked any these islands. there were also two three cripples, who were not less remarkable, the first had seen. all the females were very old, and, upon inquiring the cause, they replied, the young men had sent the young women away, fear they would be given presents. two three large sail canoes came a great distance over the inland sea, approached us without fear. the natives told us they had never seen white men before. the captain landed upon a different island myself, the natives, fled their habitations they did upon the island i landed, he sent a few old people, were found, commanding all the inhabitants return their homes, and, fearing his displeasure, a few minutes their huts were occupied the same manner though the white-faced strangers had not appeared amongst them. five, p.m., returned the schooner, our boats laden fruit, soon afterwards made sail, shaping our course the sandwich islands. were favoured south easterly trades, blowing fresh gales a number days, which rendered our passage materially shorter than would probably have been otherwise. what was still less have been expected than a south-east trade the northern tropic, was a strong current, set us the rate thirty forty miles a day, n.e. the latitude sixteen twenty-five north. part the time experienced this strong current, the wind was blowing a double-reefed top-sail breeze east e.n.e., differing only two four points the opposite direction the current. arrived the latitude twenty-three degrees north, the trades left us, the winds became variable. meridian december the 24th, were, our calculation, thirty miles an island, said have been discovered recently a whaler, which made bear us e. n. our latitude observed was twenty-five degrees fifty-seven minutes, n. longitude, chronometer, one hundred eighty-six degrees twenty-seven minutes, w. ran off the eastward all the following day, meridian, december 25th, observed, latitude twenty-six degrees, n.; longitude one hundred eighty-three degrees twenty minutes w., without seen the slightest indications land. christmas day, gave the crew a dinner turtle, which were still fat, very delicious. had fed them occasionally upon bup other vegetation, was found upon the islands. december the 27th, came within the vicinity another new discovery a whaler, meridian, had bearing, our calculation, s.e. ten miles. ran until six, p.m., december 28th, no appearance land sight, hove about, stood the northward, a newly discovered reef, which, meridian, bore us, calculation n. e., distant one hundred miles. latitude observed, twenty-six degrees ten minutes n.; longitude, chronometer, one hundred seventy-six degrees fifty-one minutes, w. the reef which were now steering was called, the discoverer, clark's reef. was said extend sixty miles, a south-west north-easterly direction, thought impossible should escape our observation, laid down any near the given latitude longitude. nine, p.m., december the 30th, were within twenty-five miles the centre the reef, our calculation, was blowing a gale, were scudding before an unusually high sea, hove the night. three, a.m., again made sail, ran the centre the reef. meridian, december the 31st, the centre was still twenty miles us, bearing n. e. n. meridian one, p.m., steered n. e., then bore up, steered east all the rest the twenty-four hours, without seeing the reef any indications it. meridian, observed, latitude twenty-six degrees forty-seven minutes, n.; longitude, chronometer, one hundred seventy-two degrees eleven minutes, w. continued the eastward, the hope falling two islands a reef, another whaler's discovery. our confidence their given latitude longitude, however, was quite destroyed frequent disappointments, now looked their discoveries, would have sought lands, known only the tradition the natives some unfrequented island, the hope finding them, little expectation success. happened these, all the rest the new discoveries had looked for. passed within a few miles the latitude, ran down one two degrees longitude, without observing any thing indicated the vicinity land. the second january, 1826, ran off the southward east ballard's island. during the middle the day, the sea, very heavy, became comparatively smooth, continued so sixty miles, the heavy swell again set the westward, before. three, p.m., the fourth january, a rock was reported the mast-head, eight leagues us. proved be ballard's island, called. eight the following morning, passed within two hundred yards it. about two three hundred yards circumference, rises two hundred feet the sea. one side a considerable inclination, seals had crawled up, several were basking the sun, almost the very top. large flocks birds were perched upon its ragged sides, wending their flight around it. not the least sign vegetation was any be seen. near its base, was a small rock, ten twenty feet above the water level. ballard's rock rises three equi-distant peaks, the centre which the highest, all them, the very base, white bird-lime. a high surf breaks all around it. our observations placed north latitude, twenty-five degrees two minuses; west longitude, one hundred sixty-seven degrees fifty minutes. the evening january the fifth, the weather became squally, constant flashes lightning distant thunder. south west, n.w., the heavens were obscured a heavy black cloud, which rose great rapidity. furled all sail. the cloud ascended our zenith, became perfectly calm, a roaring was heard the air several minutes, like wind through the tops pines, hail-stones an unusual size began fall upon our deck, accompanied very sharp lightning heavy thunder. the hail was short duration, passed over without a breath wind. the nearest the sandwich group was bird island, which steered, the ninth january, eight the morning (having the preceding night been enveloped fog) was discovered close us. tacked stood close the south-west side, was a small sand-beach, fifty a hundred yards long. the captain, taking the globe's whale-boat, went shore fish, seeing a few seal upon the sand beach, was induced land. soon afterwards became squally blew great violence. the surf upon the beach rose the wind, and, the captain, after a short examination the island, attempted return, he found impossible launch his boat through the surf, was reduced the necessity passing the night upon the island. blew a gale rained torrents all night. the captain his boat's crew took shelter a cavern upon the sea-shore, they had not been long a comfortable fire they had made, when, the rising the tide the sea broke upon them, they difficulty escaped the side the rocks, thence upon the sand-beach. the island was high almost perpendicular, the floods fell rushed down its steep sides, rocks a large size were disengaged their beds, came tumbling down every direction, the great peril the captain his boat's crew, sufficiently uncomfortable the torrents water were falling driving upon the gale. after a little search, they found an asylum a cave the side a mountain, they passed the night. the morning, they ascended the mountain, the schooner was no be seen. was high steep, she had beat up within a few miles the island passed their line sight. their disappointment chagrin was inexpressible, supposing, the schooner's not sight, she had been driven off, would be a considerable time before she could return, afford them relief their situation so much required, very much fatigued exhausted their exposure. day-light, the weather cleared the wind moderated. beat up hove off the sand-beach nearly soon the boat had sent refreshments. the captain saw the schooner approaching close the island, he made a last effort launch his boat. they succeeded getting her into the breakers, the first heavy roller broke under them severed the boat amid-ships, the captain upon one end her a man could not swim the other, were hove up safely the beach the succeeding wave. the rest the boat's crew were good swimmers, also landed safety. our boat was not far off this occurred, anchoring near possible the shore, the men, all one, swam off her through the surf. the only way could devise get the captain seaman off, was float a cork-jacket shore, the end a line, which being put the captain seaman, alternately, a rope tied round them, they were hauled through the surf without any other injury than swallowing a quantity salt-water. bird's island an uninhabited rock, about a league circumference, the highest part five eight hundred feet above the ocean. our boat landed, the only spot a landing could be effected, upon side alone an inclination which may be ascended. every else perpendicular, a distance, looks like the work art. a scanty vegetation. five, p.m., january the 11th, made sail the island oahoo, a fine breeze the westward pleasant weather. daylight, the following morning, saw the small island onehow, soon afterwards, the highland atooi. during the whole day, were coming up sailing along the west side atooi, moving the rate eight nine miles per hour. a clear day, may be seen least fifty sixty miles. did not approach nearer than eight ten. had the appearance, distance, beautiful table-land, being every very regular nearly the same altitude. towards evening, the 12th january, made the island oahoo, should have been anchor onavoora the following day had passed between atooi oahoo, some mistake about the prevailing winds the opposite side oahoo, continued round the north end it, did not anchor onavoora until the sixteenth. two three american merchant vessels were lying there, which exchanged salutes. the dolphin was the first american man-of-war ever entered a harbour the sandwich islands, the firing the guns, the report widely circulated an american man-of-war had arrived, brought the inhabitants far near the shore the harbour witness the novel sight. several our countrymen, who were traders here, had been expecting us some time, came board offer their congratulations, invite us shore partake their hospitality. was highly gratifying us upon landing, meet nearly all our countrymen residing the island, who came down, en masse, the beach, welcome us shore, the most kind friendly manner. were a little disappointed, however, came look round found none the missionaries had partaken the general sentiment. they were also our countrymen, the character benevolence philanthropy they had assumed themselves, we had a right expect they would have been amongst the first hail us a welcome their lonely abode. we expected, indeed, they would not only have received us countrymen, friends, whose kindness, sympathy would be highly acceptable them their peculiar situation. the shore we were escorted a large frame building called the wooden-house, then occupied our countryman, captain wilds, a handsome dinner was prepared, which every luxury was added could be obtained the shipping the shore. we were much surprised landing, find a rabble naked half-naked natives, amounting many hundreds, we had been taught believe, the various information we had received, their condition was much improved, they were far advanced civilization. they were all ages, formed a more varied fantastic group than i had any seen, even no degree civilization had taken place, an intercourse white men. some them were quite naked; some had their native dress tappa cloths; some had cotton shirts, some a pair old trowsers, some nothing an old jacket. many them had adorned their heads wreaths red yellow flowers, some their necks wrists necklaces bracelets shells. they expressed the greatest pleasure seeing us, shouting crowding around, so we could not get along without pushing them out the way. appearance, a comparison them the natives the marquesas mulgrave islands, would have been greatly their disadvantage. the following day, we were again invited dine the same place, we met a second time our countrymen, interchanged them those sentiments friendship sympathy naturally arise meeting a strange land, which felt americans peculiar force. appeared us they could not sufficiently express their gratification seeing us oahoo, the most unremitted attention, they continued feast give us parties every day more than a week, until our various pressing duties made inconvenient us partake them. the first sabbath after our arrival, i went the place worship appointed the missionaries the natives. a large building, formerly occupied this purpose, had been destroyed a short time previous our arrival, they had now no house sufficiently large contain the whole congregation, the place appointed worship was an extensive enclosure the rear a large frame building, which occupied the dwelling the young king. within this enclosure, was assembled about a thousand people, i supposed, seated the ground. some them were dressed silks, cottons, calicoes, others were their native dress, being quite naked, except about the waist. they were the open air, without any protection the sun, which was pouring its vertical rays upon them. mr. bingham, the head the mission, was addressing them the language the island, he saw me the outer edge the circle, very kindly beckoned me come round the queen dowager was seated. he was standing there himself. a native was holding an umbrella over his head, around him were seated all the chief men women, some chairs, some them the ground. one two exceptions, they were all people uncommon size. some them were quite neatly dressed, others had displayed a most whimsical ridiculous fancy. i came near cahumanu, who was the favourite wife the departed highly distinguished tamahamaha, she extended her hand me bade one her attendants bring me a chair. the service lasted about an hour, the assemblage dispersed, the natives ran away much pleased so many children let loose school. the close the service, i promised myself so much politeness the part the distinguished personages present, receive some them an invitation go into their houses, i was the uniform a foreign officer; this i was altogether disappointed. i had the satisfaction speaking, a few minutes, mr. bingham, whose attention was soon called me the presence some chief, whom he wished exchange a salutation, after recognizing two three the chiefs present whom i had seen before, i was suffered depart without receiving any further notice. monday, i made a call ceremony the high chief boque, who was one the attendants the late king rio rio, his visit the king england. he was a man about thirty years age, upwards six feet, stout proportion. he had a flat nose thick lips, the general expression his face was benevolence good nature--an expression truly characteristic, according the testimony those who have had an opportunity knowing him well. we found him sitting a chair a table, a desk before him, upon which he was making pot-hooks after a copy, just commenced learning write. he got up shook hands us, did also his wife, who was seated some mats the other end the hut. boque was dressed a coarse linen shirt trowsers, a pair heavy shoes his feet, without any stockings. queen boque was nearly large her husband, looked a good deal like him. she had a plain white muslin cap dress, neither which were very clean neatly put on. was, however, good taste could be expected so rude a state society, i thought less becoming than would have been her native dress. she invited us be seated, made an attempt politeness, such she had seen practised england, accompanied her husband thither. the hut was an oblong building, about sixty forty feet. its simple structure was the same has been use the islands time immemorial, being poles laid over crotches, upon which the rafters rested, differing nothing the habitations the poorest people, except the crotches, poles, rafters, were longer, there were more them. was thatched the top all the way the ground, a thick covering grass. the interior was all one apartment, the top the rafters the hard beaten ground floor. there was nothing ornamental, no superfluous furniture. a bedstead standing one corner, some pieces white tappa cloth the island curtains, whereon was laid a pile mats a bed; two three piles mats laying along near the centre the hut, raised one two feet the floor, being piled one above the other, beds lounging places; two three old chairs; a plain table small dimensions, a dressing-case a mirror it, was all boque's furniture, either useful ornamental. besides these may be mentioned a few hollow gourds poye, (a favourite food the sandwich islanders, made the tarrow,) hanging the side the hut. leaving boque's palace, we went the intention making a similar call upon the high chief crimacu, known strangers who have visited the island, the name billy pitt. he was the high carnie, great friend tamahamaha, whose wars he was greatly distinguished personal prowess, sagacity, wisdom. we came his hut, we found him sleeping a swinging cot, several attendants sitting round, one whom was fanning him. he was very ill health, a long time been afflicted the dropsy, we departed without waking him. his hut differed nothing boque, except was not so large, had a greater profusion mats it. was standing one corner an extensive plain, was partially enclosed a wicker fence just the outskirts the town onaroora, all around was growing wild grass weeds, except the footsteps the people, who passed the hut, had trodden them down. looked little like the habitation a man who had been a great warrior, associated second authority one who had conquered ruled over thousands men. one would naturally suppose emerging a savage state, absolute power, he would have made an attempt, least, imitate the style manners the white men whom he was constantly meeting, always terms friendship. after we had interchanged salutes the shore, chief boque came board the 17th, make us a visit ceremony. he was dressed a splendid english major-general's uniform, made a very handsome appearance. he remained partook a collation us, which several gentlemen were invited meet him, all respects acquitted himself a more polite becoming manner than could have been expected one whose opportunities had been so limited. he drank sparingly wine, left us an early hour, notwithstanding the solicitations the company him remain. a few hours after he had landed, i met him again, should hardly have recognized him his large stature good-natured face. he had stripped himself all his finery, was walking over the plain his house nothing his marrow, a piece tappa cloth the island thrown loosely over his shoulders. i asked him he had taken off his uniform, which he replied, was too warm. our countrymen, vary the entertainments they were constantly giving us, thereby make them the more acceptable, proposed we should make an excursion a valley, called them pearl river, the pearl frequently found a small stream passes through it. horses could not be obtained all, part the company went water, whilst the rest, four five, mounted horseback. the distance was about fifteen miles. i made one the land party, we set off early the afternoon. there was no road, many places not even a footpath. the whole way was over hill dale, through swamps. we had jump fences ditches made through tarrow-patches, ascend narrow paths, difficult dangerous cliffs. all the afternoon was occupied this manner, was sundown we arrived our place destination. one old native made bold oppose us jumping our horses over his fence, was so obstinate his refusal let us pass, a time we thought we should have relinquish our excursion--a reflection not very agreeable, after having advanced more than half way over so wretched a road. finally, all other arguments had failed, some one the party, thinking the native opposed our trespass upon his premises no other object than lay us under contribution, gave him half a dollar, which did more us than all our threats persuasion. instead opposing, he afterwards pointed out us the best way. onavoora pearl river, the country was thinly inhabited. we met no considerable village rich valley. our road lay near the edge a wide marsh, intervened between us the sea, the opposite direction which, an undulating country extended three four miles, was interrupted the high uninhabited range mountains run through the centre the island one end the other. was saturday evening, we arrived pearl river, and, according the doctrine which the missionaries had instructed the sandwich islanders, their sabbath had commenced. the hut we were occupy belonged captain dana, an american gentleman, whom we were indebted many hours agreeable pastime. besides the hut, he possessed other property the valley, which gave him an influence the chief it, enabled him command whatever produced. we arrived, the chief was seated a mat, near captain dana's hut, moody, and, apparently, very stupid. the arrival so many strangers, a place a visiter was scarcely ever seen, produced a lively interest amongst the villagers. all them seemed partake the general excitement, the chief, though celebrated his hospitality, was now sunk the most listless apathy, apparently scarcely sensible our presence. he was told we wanted supper, preparation made our accommodation the morrow, he replied, was the sabbath, neither then nor the morrow could fire be made, was forbidden the almighty. upon being asked he knew was forbidden the almighty, he said, mr. bingham had seen the almighty, who told him so. this was a great check our promised enjoyment, one we were quite unprepared for, no prohibition making fire saturday, any other night, was existence onavoora. we saw a poor prospect getting supper any thing, indeed, until we returned, unless we fasted sunday, our religious scruples did not call for, were not unavoidable. we were unwilling, however, interfere the established observances, which had been thought necessary civilize improve the condition the people, bore our disappointment silence. after wandering about the village a while, which was small, scattered over a sterile ridge, we were relieved our unpleasant dilemma a native, we had taken us cook interpreter, who was commonly known upon the island the name joe banks. he had received some education, had been a convert the missionaries, whom he afterwards seceded. he did not like fasting any more than ourselves, set about haranguing the chief, convince him the error his opinion, respect the making fire. joe was not wanting either talent volubility; and, our great satisfaction, we soon found him good terms the chief; a fire was made, soon after a kid a pig brought up slaughter. i observed, the chief's skin was very rough scales, resembling somewhat the shell a small terrapin. upon inquiring the cause, they told me, was the effect the ava-root, which he was undergoing a course. he had almost finished the course, his skin was all peeling off. was the effect the ava, made him so stupid, under its operation he was a most disgusting looking object. the natives the sandwich islands very much subject cutaneous irruptions, which troublesome, and, long standing, often dangerous. eradicate this, some other offensive diseases, which they afflicted, they sometimes go through a course the ava. taken quantities a gill half a pint, the juice the green root. chewed, the juice spit into a gourd, intended the use another person than the one who prepares it, said, taken, deprive the person muscular power. a few moments after swallowing the potion, he loses the use all his limbs. he experiences an agreeable sensation, conscious every thing transpires, without the power speech. he lies this helpless condition several hours, he recovers his strength a measure, is left the condition a man has been very much intoxicated. this, have the desired effect, is repeated daily about a month; the disease is cured, the skin all comes off, a fair shining one is left its place. once was settled between joe banks the chief pearl river valley, fire should be made, our supper cooked, he provided us the most sumptuous native style. we had pigs, goats, fish, tarrow, potatoes, the greatest profusion. all was cooked after the manner the natives, the same method is practised generally amongst the islanders the pacific ocean, knowing, experience, is a very good one, i here describe it. a hole is first dug a foot two deep, large, according the size the thing be cooked. a fire is then made the hole, and, is burning well, covered over stones a convenient size. every thing is readiness, the stones being well heated, they taken off, the hole cleared out. a layer stones is then placed all round the interior, upon which is lain the meat, after being well wrapped up green leaves. over this is placed a thick layer stones, which is covered grass, something dry, then earth. vegetables be cooked, they lain the top the upper layer stones. the young tops the tarrow usually wrapped up leaves, cooked the meats the manner above described. is a very excellent green, called the natives lewoca, which the method cooking takes its name. early the morning after our arrival, we arose, look upon the wild beauty the valley, wander through what, a distance, appeared be its meadows lawns; but, our great disappointment, descending the hills, the green level fields looked so pleasant a distance, were all cut up tarrow patches, flooded over, intersected every direction ditches embankments. a scene, so uninviting, soon induced us relinquish our anticipated pleasure, return. the course our morning's walk we came the house an englishman, who, a few years previous, arrived the island a peruvian man-of-war, the seamen which had risen upon their officers, ran away the vessel. he had taken himself a native wife, and, all appearance, had fixed here his abode life. his hut looked extremely comfortable--not less so, indeed, than the chief, besides other property he had acquired, he had a fine flock sheep feeding near his residence. he politely invited us into his house, which we declined, we were returning late breakfast. after breakfast we set off our boat visit a small island near the sea shore, there were a great many rabbits. we passed along several miles an inlet the sea, before we came it. was half a mile long, level, overgrown high weeds. the rabbits were so numerous, the island was every perforated their burrows, one more would be found almost every bunch high grass we came to,--so tame, we could frequently take them up our hands. we caught more than a dozen them this way, the short time we remained. some years previous, an old spaniard, the name menini, who had settled onavoora, put one more pairs rabbits upon this small island, prevailed upon the chiefs tabboo them. time they had not been disturbed. after returning our dinner, we all set off our way back onuvoora. vary the scene, i relinquished my horse took passage the boat. we sailed several miles among marshes barren islands, upon a salt water inlet, up which a ship heavy burthen might pass a considerable distance. the whole way was quite void interest. we got the sea, we had a head wind row against all the way. a reef extended out the shore, beyond which we were compelled go, making the distance so great, the evening was far advanced before we got the dolphin. not long after our return pearl river, i set out one day an american gentleman, ascend a high steep mountain, rises back the village, which the natives, many years ago, fortified a few heavy pieces cannon. we crossed the plain, which is a mile a mile a half wide, we came the base the mountain. was seven eight hundred feet high, below, seemed rise almost perpendicular the plain. a winding footpath, however, showed us had long frequently been ascended the natives, encouraged us make the attempt. we had often stop get breath, last accomplished our object, gaining the summit entering upon a small plain. here we found several huts, were occupied the families the men appointed guard this important post, into which we entered obtain leave examine the fortification. the people were very friendly; they not only granted us permission, hospitably proffered us some excellent melons, which were very refreshing after our laborious ascent. there were only three men the fort, one whom, appeared have the command, politely waited upon us our walk round. the guns were mounted a platform, the very edge the precipice overlooked the harbour town. they were thirty-two pound caliber. must have been a work inconceivable labour the natives get them upon this great eminence. the carriages all their fixtures were very much decayed, totally unfit use. the situation is very commanding, notwithstanding the distance, the battery would be formidable an enemy the harbour. this eminence, we had an extensive beautiful prospect, comprehending the valley harbour, many miles sea, along the sea-coast either direction. the river, waters the valley, broken cataracts rapidly descended the sea, showed its greatest advantage, the valley, covered its tarrow patches, corn, potatoes, presented a landscape resembling finely cultivated fields waving green meadows. front, was the thatched village onavoora, the huts looking like heaps dry straw; beyond it, the harbour shipping; still farther, sea, a long range white foaming breakers. the extreme right, was the valley pearl river, bounded high rugged mountains; the left, the cocoa-nut groves whytete diamond rock, its adjacent sterile hills, covered volcanic cinders. the top the hill, we descended a different direction our return, a view passing through a part the valley runs far back the shore between the mountains, appeared be finely cultivated well inhabited. we had not gone far the fort, we found ourselves near the centre what had been the crater a volcano, which, its resemblance, has given the eminence the name the punch bowl, which is familiarly known amongst foreigners. the crater is about a quarter half a mile diameter, one two hundred feet deep. we descended the valley, which was not without difficulty, our way was every interrupted tarrow patches, their ditches, embankments. after crossing a small valley, we came an elevated piece ground, the natives who cultivated the tarrow below, had built their habitations, around them planted groves banana. was a fine morning, the people both sexes were industriously engaged their appropriate occupations. some the women were roasting tarrow, others making up poye. the latter operation was interesting me, i had never seen before. the tarrow is roasted, the skin taken off, resembles a potatoe; is then put into a tray, a long, smooth stone, beaten up fine possible, occasionally mixing a small quantity water it; after has been beaten this way, is worked over a number times, get all the lumps out; then has the appearance a thick paste starch. a soon it foments a little becomes slightly acid, it is used. this state, it not last long before it becomes very sour, is then considered so unwholesome, unless the people very poor, it is thrown away. after satisfying our curiosity seeing the women make poye, we descended the hill several men were preparing a tarrow patch. it was forty feet square, excavated a little, an embankment two feet high thrown up all around it, descending a considerable angle the top the base, making it very broad the bottom. the labourers had advanced thus far, were beating the area inner sides the embankment broad heavy paddles, going over it a great many times. it appeared very hard firm we saw them work; still, they told us, they had beat it a great deal more. this is completed, the tops the tarrow have been cut off the purpose, set the ground lightly flooded water; after it has taken root began grow thriftily, more water is let upon it; the tarrow well grown, generally be covered water the depth one two feet. it is about the size a beet, takes a year more come its greatest perfection. it has clusters broad bright green leaves, shape appearance a good deal like the common pond lilly. it is a very nutricious vegetable, constitutes the principal means subsistence the sandwich islanders. the huts the natives were very small, although the midst cultivation fertility, the inhabitants seemed be wretchedly poor. they did not appear much more civilized than the natives the marquesas; their habitations were certainly less comfortable. returning the village, we saw a number people scraping sticks looked like our elder, preserving the inner bark. upon inquiring its use, they told us it was catch fish with. eaten the fish, they come the top the water taken out hand. it is said, the fish not the worse this. our arrival oahoo, the dolphin was out repair every respect, it was indispensably necessary refit her, before we proceeded further our return the coast chili peru. whilst the masts were out, the vessel was undergoing general repairs, the captain received a letter captain edwards, the ship loudon, new-york, stating he had ran upon a reef, the island ranai; besides a valuable cargo, he had a large amount specie bullion board. the chief thunder, (chief ranai,) was encouraging the natives the island plunder him, finally, his life treasure was the greatest jeopardy. although not incumbent upon him a duty, captain percival, a promptitude highly creditable himself the service which he belonged, chartered a vessel, the crew the dolphin, boque, the governor oahoo, sailed the same day he received the letter. he found the situation captain edwards not less critical than he had described it be. the natives had already plundered him a part his cargo, his own crew was a state mutiny. employing the authority chief boque, the indefatigable industry his own crew, captain percival caused the stolen goods be restored, the cargo treasure the loudon be safely landed oahoo. all this had been accomplished, captain edwards refused pay the charter the vessel was employed his relief, consequence which, a quarrel arose between himself captain percival, eventuated consequences injurious disagreeable both parties, after our return home, became a subject judicial investigation. this investigation, which was brought the instance captain edwards, an opportunity was afforded captain percival the officers the dolphin, vindicate their characters, which they did, every instance, the entire satisfaction their government countrymen. whilst captain percival was absent ranai, captain jackson, the brig harbinger, boston, addressed a letter me, stating his store the village had been broken open, robbed goods a large amount, requesting my assistance recover them. the matter was laid before the chief, crimacu, who instituted a search, the following day, sent captain jackson. his hut, were assembled most the foreigners any respectability the island, many the natives witness the result the inquiry. some the thieves had already been detected, now stood before the chief, who, although very ill, sat up question them about the robbery. they confessed their guilt, answering the questions put them, convicted others, who were sent brought in, until the number amounted six. they had shared their booty, were sent out, guards, bring it their different places concealment. it consisted, principally, fine calicoes cloths, which had been put tarrow patches, oil casks, returned, were so damaged, be little value the owner. the chief got through the inquiry, had collected all the goods could be found, he asked mr. jackson what punishment he would have inflicted upon the offenders. mr. jackson's reply was, he wanted restitution made the loss he had sustained, he would leave the punishment the chief, according the usage the islands. the chief contended the men were all poor, had nothing wherewith pay. he said the chiefs were also poor, denied the justice compelling them, under any circumstances, pay the thefts the people. he offered put the culprits captain jackson's disposal, inflict upon them whatever punishment he should prescribe, according the laws his own country. captain jackson refused say what punishment the men should receive, only contended the chief was bound see his property, an equivalent, restored him. the matter was, some hours debate, the chief compromised captain jackson, promising have a quantity sandal-wood collected him within a prescribed period. the thieves were set liberty without punishment, consequence which, it was surmised some our countrymen, the chiefs had been concerned the theft. this, i thought, a very unjust suspicion, the investigation took place so publicly, the fact, it had been so, could hardly have failed appear the course the inquiry. the magnanimity crimacu,[14] promising an equivalent the damaged goods, which he was not bound the customs the sandwich islands, the laws civilized communities, gave me the highest opinion his character. it appeared me he first objected remunerate the merchant his loss, no other motive than produce discussion, which he might learn what would be done more enlightened countries, a similar case. he was told the different punishments the culprits would be subject under the laws america england, nothing could be advanced, even supposing he was act accordance the laws those countries, prove the chiefs king the islands, were any other way responsible the thefts committed individuals, than make them stand forth suffer person their offences. he remarked, the information he received individuals the same country, respect their laws customs, was often variance, so contradictory, he was frequently a loss know what he should do answer the ends justice, give satisfaction the strangers who came the islands. he declared, the chiefs the sandwich islands, wished do like other people. amongst those whom we held frequent friendly intercourse, was an englishman, the name wilkinson, who had taken passage the sandwich islands, the frigate blonde, she went there the remains king rio rio, who had banished himself his own country this distant region, a view becoming a planter the sandwich islands. he had been, according his own statement, a planter the west indies early life, subsequently his return england, joined a troop horse, which he was a captain, destined spain, during the war the peninsula, he served a considerable time, the close the war, having left the army, met a reverse fortune, he had determined make the experiment which he was now engaged. a bold one, it must be confessed, a man, the age forty-five, an enfeebled constitution. aided captain byron, (who, his high rank, the flattering mission upon which he had been sent, was well prepared assist him,) mr. wilkinson obtained the chiefs the first deed ever was granted them, two hundred acres land. it was situated about six miles onavoora, elevated ground, bordering upon a narrow valley winds through the mountains several miles back the sea. the chiefs granted the deed great reluctance, notwithstanding the respectable source which the petition came, being extremely tenacious command sovereignty the soil, enables them, pleasure, dispossess the occupant. they the more willingly relinquished the spot mr. wilkinson had fixed upon his residence, it was situated upon land so high, it could not be used the culture tarrow, was the time unoccupied. uncommon industry, although cramped the want money, would have given it its full effect, he had reclaimed a wild state, about fifty acres land, which, we arrived there, was planted sugar-cane, corn, potatoes, bananas, &c., thus providing his immediate wants, whilst the cane promised a rich harvest, would amply reward him his toil, whenever he could complete his machinery the manufacture sugar. this, however, all appearance we were there, he would encounter great difficulty, materials were not easily obtained; although there were some mechanics the island, their constant employment the village, they could frequently see their countrymen, withal, their fondness pleasure was likely deprive him a long time their useful services, without which, he could do nothing. connected his land, was a stream water running the mountains, would answer his purpose manufacturing sugar. a part it possessed all local advantages, he had made a dam collected part the materials a mill, be constructed the simplest manner, which, the want mechanical aid, lay almost the same rude state which he had purchased them. he anticipated, however, great confidence, the time the cane was ready cutting, the mill would be prepared, the hopes which he had first been stimulated, could scarcely fail be realized. the sugar cane grows wild upon the sandwich islands, mr. wilkinson's fields were the native growth, which he had planted prepared land, our departure, the canes were upwards six feet high. although several strangers, familiar the arts civilized countries, have settled lived, many years, amongst the sandwich islanders, mr. wilkinson was the first individual who ever attempted put them practice, upon a scale, sufficiently extensive improve, materially, the agricultural condition the islands, thereby prove the inhabitants the wealth they possess, a rich soil, one the finest climates the face the globe. should mr. wilkinson be successful, the result his experiment probably do more towards the civilization the natives, their ultimate advancement knowledge lasting prosperity, than has yet been effected all the white men have lived amongst them. this, i am aware, be considered a rash assertion the good people our country, who, the best motives, feel deeply engaged foreign missions, and, expressing this opinion, i also bear testimony the useful services the missionaries. the best information i could obtain upon the subject, i am satisfied, they have improved the morals the people, they devote themselves the schools they have established, introducing the arts life civilization, the time may not be distant, the natives be prepared receive christianity. their present condition, would it not be better, more the true spirit benevolence philanthropy which is inspired our religion, teach them cultivate their land, introduce grain fruits, congenial the climate, plant reap we do, rather than imbue their minds a mysterious doctrine, which, being beyond their comprehension, must resolve itself into a dark intolerant superstition. the inhabitants the sandwich islands, mild, amiable, intelligent, susceptible the highest degree moral intellectual improvement. a people, it may be said, the stamp civilization is scarcely perceptible yet upon them; it is now inevitable, they must bear the impress those, whom our philanthropists have sent convert them christianity; and, whether they become ignorant zealots, intelligent christians, will depend upon their teachers. the situation these missionaries is, therefore, one high responsibility, ought not, christian charity, be occupied the narrow-minded fanatic, the ignorant zealot. it is the first importance they, who dispose the vast means the missionary society, should select only such men civilizing christianizing the sandwich islanders, distinguished their knowledge, love the useful arts life, well practical piety. the harbour onavoora, is a place general rendezvous the whale ships, cruising the coast japan, the vicinity the islands. the months january, february, march, being the least favourable their business, they then leave their cruising ground, go search refreshment. no place is so convenient them the sandwich islands, the port onavoora, being the most commodious any the group, affording an abundant supply vegetables, hogs, &c.,--they all congregate there the months above mentioned. the average number visit the island the course the year, is upwards fifty. more than twenty were there together, several different periods our stay, some which remained a few days, some weeks, a few one two months, according their several necessities. such times the seamen, having been long confined the narrow precinct their vessels, become very insubordinate, frequently give way the most licentious indulgences their passions, regardless every obligation obedience due their officers. we witnessed frequent instances this kind, had the satisfaction being constantly useful the captains ships, the whaling interest, restraining the violent, coercing them a proper sense duty. a most unpleasant occurrence took place about six weeks after our arrival at onavoora, arising this disposition the seamen, other causes, which was afterwards greatly misrepresented this country. some the seamen the dolphin, who were liberty, got into a frolic, and, associating themselves many others belonging the whale ships, determined go the houses the high chiefs missionaries, demand the repeal a restriction deprived them the society females. they produced a riot gave rise a considerable degree excitement a few minutes; captain percival, some the officers the dolphin, captains whale-ships, promptly suppressed it, prevented any serious outrage. it was afterwards unjustly most ungenerously ascribed the officers the dolphin. the white population onavoora is a varied character, the agent our north west traders, the most abandoned members society. there fifty a hundred, permanently settled at onavoora; the least respectable whom, maintain themselves keeping tippling shops tor sailors, practising such chicaneries suggested opportunities the absence law. the season the whalers visit the island is the time their harvest, when, besides their gains entertaining the seamen, they frequently prevail upon them desert the sake the reward their apprehension, strip them what little money clothes they may be possessed of. some them have married women the island, live much the same way the natives. all the permanent settlers at onavoora, the most remarkable was a spaniard the name meninne, who had been the islands upwards thirty years. his manner getting there, a variety stories were told. his own account was, being invited board a vessel visited the coast california, he fell asleep the evening, and, he awoke, found himself at sea, the vessel running, a fair wind, the sandwich islands. all his entreaties be returned land were vain, he arrived at owhyhee, where, poor friendless, he was landed amongst the natives. he wandered island island, a forlorn wretched condition, until he was taken under the patronage tamahamaha. a long time, he followed the fortunes the native warrior, at length fixed his residence at oahoo, whence he occasionally embarked interpreter board merchant vessels, bound smuggling voyages the coast america. after passing through a variety fortune, being several times made prisoner threatened death, he finally quitted his vagrant life, remained permanently at oahoo, where, great industry economy, he has acquired an amount property which, place, is a princely fortune. besides having money the united states england, he owns nearly all the cattle the island oahoo, a number horses, flocks goats, sheep, &c. he has extensive possessions land, which he holds the chiefs consideration his services, a great many houses. he has taken some pains introduce exotics the islands, besides the lemon, orange, other valuable fruits, has a vineyard which he makes a considerable quantity wine annually. he is said be extremely selfish, so jealous preserving himself a monopoly these valuable fruits, he has been accused destroying the young plants others. he is considered ranking amongst the chiefs the enjoyment certain privileges; and, speaking the language the islands well, is called upon interpreter the government upon all important occasions. he has had thirty-seven children various wives, is yet the prime life. like most men who have felt the cold hand poverty, afterwards acquired wealth, he is extremely penurious, thinks nothing so much adding his fortune without knowing enjoy it. the 3d april, the young king all the high chiefs, were invited board spend the day us. the morning, we dressed the schooner all the flags we could muster, made the best preparation our limited accommodation would admit receive our distinguished guests. no indication their appearance was seen some time after every thing was readiness, our boats shore waiting, we were kept suspense until we had almost despaired seeing them. all at once the whole town was an uproar, the people were running hallooing every direction. the young king advance, walked arm arm one the officers the dolphin. next came boque his spouse, other high dignitaries, the rear a multitude people both sexes all ages. they had embarked, the eyes the people were turned upon another object, not less interesting them than the king. crimacu, billy pitt, too ill walk, was gravely making his way the beach a hand cart, he got into a boat came board soon after the king. we received them manned yards, a salute twenty-one guns. the king, who was a boy ten twelve years old, was dressed a military uniform was sent him the king england, upon his shoulders he wore a pair golden epaulets, crowns them. he appeared be sensible his rank, and, upon two three occasions, addressed his attendants a way that indicated a wish make a display his authority. the chiefs conducted themselves towards him a becoming respect, without bestowing upon him any attention that might interfere their own enjoyment convenience. instead partaking what we had provided our guests, they, one two exceptions, unceremoniously uncovered their poye pots, which had been brought them an attendant, ate heartily their favourite food, using their fingers is the native custom. boque again displayed his major general's uniform, was amongst the most polished our guests. after passing a number hours board, they returned the shore delighted their visit. the same compliment was paid them at their reception. it was a day great enjoyment the common people. they received their chiefs landing loud huzzas, followed them crowds their respective habitations. we passed all the winter months at onavoora, during which we had frequent heavy rains. some the storms were attended violent gales, disagreeably cold weather. about the 3d may, an influenza made its appearance amongst the inhabitants oahoo, two days not a well native was any be seen. the market, being well attended, was deserted. a week, the distress was so general so great, that it was feared the poor people would perish hunger. i visited several families, not a member which was able help himself others, all were totally destitute food. a great many the people died, amongst the rest two chiefs, one whom was george tamauri, a native the island atooi, who was educated this country. the other was cahaliha, next affinity the king. scarcely any the white people were affected. not even those living shore. about ten days, the people the country began make their appearance the market, the distress was greatly alleviated, soon afterwards the general good health restored. at such times suffering, the condition these people is truly wretched. they have no floor their huts the hard-beaten ground which their naked bodies separated only two three thin mats, during the rainy season the earth becomes perfectly saturated water. their huts generally built a very frail manner, a driving storm are not proof against the rain. this, alone, is sufficient account the thinly populated state the islands, without charging the natives the acts inhumanity that have been ascribed them some people. the harbour onavoora is formed coral reefs, that extend upwards a mile the shore. the entrance it is narrow somewhat difficult. it affords water enough a sloop war. a pilot out the harbour, is always employed. it is very secure, being quite land locked. the holding ground is good, vessels may lay safety close along side the beach. the water is perfectly smooth good weather, the bottom shores being nearly every soft mud, a vessel might be driven upon them a gale without sustaining any material injury. the visits the numerous whale ships has made onavoora a place considerable trade. all them spend more less money their necessary refreshments, out repair, their disbursements are frequently very considerable. the supplies afforded the natives, thousands dollars are annually received them, which they give return silk, cotton, calicoes, cloth, &c. two three stores, well stocked a great variety goods, are supported onavoora this interchange commodities; and, the way which the trade is conducted, there is little doubt that the proprietors are rewarded handsome profits. the sandal wood has become scarce upon the islands, the large quantities formerly taken away our traders, does not now form a very lucrative extensive article commerce. upon this article, some our merchants are said have made large sums money exchange whole cargoes goods, the chiefs the sandwich islands. it is related tamahamaha, that, after making a purchase this kind, which he paid ship loads sandal wood, brought the mountains great labour himself people, he has been known load a number canoes secretly at night, fine broadcloths, take them out sea, he sunk them stones. his only reason it was, that the possession them would make his chiefs people too luxurious idle, bringing sandal wood the mountains pay more, would give them employment. a doubtful policy, certainly, the statement be true. be this as it may, himself successor have entailed upon their descendants a national debt several hundred thousands dollars, now due our merchants, which they will not soon be able liquidate. the 11th may, after long anticipating our much wished departure, we got underway, saluting the fort as we passed it twenty-one guns, stood out sea shaped our course chili. nothing material transpired the time our sailing until the 7th june, standing along a fresh trade, the night dark squally, at 10 p.m., the lookout-ahead reported land close aboard. we tacked lay the night, survey our newly discovered island the following morning. at daylight, it bore s.s.w., about six miles us, appeared three small hummocs, covered thickly trees bushes, every bounded a coral reef heavy surf. we hesitated some time whether we should land, apprehending that it would be attended too much risk, merely the gratification curiosity; this feeling operated so powerfully upon us, that there was no resisting the desire land no one had ever been before. accordingly, two boats were sent off, watching a favourable opportunity passed through the surf safety, landed the coral bank they were left high dry the receding wave. it was the lee side the island, a coral reef stretched off about fifty a hundred yards the shore, full holes, almost dry at low water. the holes we sought fish, as at caroline island, found very few. traversing the island, we could find no fruit vegetable any description except bup. most places it was covered trees bushes a thick growth, almost impenetrable. the bushes we found a great many tropical birds setting, so tame that we could take them off their nests our hands, getting upon the weather side the island there was a clear space, we found a species small gull, so numerous, that when they rose the ground at our approach, they appeared form almost a compact mass. the sand was literally covered their eggs, which, upon examination, proved be unfit use, few exceptions. the birds flew hovered so near us that we caught several them our hands. after amusing ourselves a little while the novel spectacle such numbers birds so very tame, we collected all the old eggs within a small space, less than twenty minutes after it had been thus cleared, it was again covered fresh eggs the birds that were constantly lighting. we might, a few hours, have loaded our boats them. when we returned our boats go board, the tide had risen, it the surf had increased an alarming degree. at first, we held a consultation whether we should attempt pass through it remain until it should again subside the falling the tide; the day was far advanced, the appearance the weather such, as all probability would render our situation extremely painful, there being every prospect an increase wind. we therefore determined put our fortune the test, were not a little discouraged when one the boats attempting the surf was thrown back the second roller that she encountered the utmost violence, upsetting her, scattering the people different directions, some them escaping their lives the greatest difficulty. notwithstanding the ill success our first attempt, we determined a second, rather than risk the consequences longer delay. embracing a favourable opportunity the surf appeared least violent, we put off, passed through it safety without further accident. the island was little more than a mile long, a hundred yards a quarter a mile wide. it was every very low. a meridian observation, we placed the north-west end it latitude south 21 degrees 48 minutes, longitude chronometer 154 degrees 54 minutes west. compliment the commander our squadron the pacific ocean, we called it hull's island. it may be comprehended within the group society islands. the afternoon, june the 4th, we made sail; the following day at half-past 6 o'clock, a.m. discovered the island ramitaria, the lee bow, about eight leagues us. this island was not laid down any our charts, having been discovered only three four years before; we had seen a gentlemen who had stopped there, it was included our list islands. approaching it we were pleased find that it differed many the islands we had visited, being a moderate elevation. it is about three miles long one two wide. we ran nearly round it before we found a place land, the surf breaking high every where, the shores bounded large rocks coral. at last, we came the principal settlement, which was situated close the shore, a large white-washed house indicated the former visits influences the missionaries. the people, the number one two hundred, were assembled the beach inviting us land. here, also, was a considerable surf some coral rocks, which made the landing not altogether free difficulty. when the boat came near the shore while she was yet shooting rapidly through the surf, the natives, who had already advanced meet us, laid hold as many as could get round her, loud shouting, carried us high upon the beach. at this somewhat unexpected reception, the boat's crew instinctively seized their pistols, thinking at first, that the natives were hostile their disposition towards us. it was a momentery panic which passed away the kind salutations we immediately afterwards received. when i enquired the chief, a young man was pointed out me the crowd, distinguished the rest an old hat his head, that he had obtained some former visiter. he seemed not be treated the least respect the people, who jostled him the crowd the most perfect carelessness. scarcely had i addressed him, when a stout native came up an air some importance, saluting me, told me the language the society islands, that he was the missionary. upon his approach, the chief immediately shrunk back into the crowd. he called him a malay, who was not far off, bade him ask what we wanted. the malay, whose name was manoo, spoke english very well, which was a source great satisfaction us, as we could thereby communicate our wants freely, it introduced us at once each others' acquaintance. i explained manoo that we were want water such refreshments as the island might afford. he immediately proceeded company the missionary show me water was be obtained. we passed through a forest very large trees over a plain that extended more than half a mile, when we came a marsh reeds rank grass, there was one two feet water, covering an area two three acres. this would not answer our purpose as the water was not very good, its distance the place embarkation rendered it too laborious an undertaking water the vessel it. when i had remarked this manoo the missionary, they replied that there was better water, but it was still more distant. i suffered them conduct me it, we took a footpath over rising ground, through another delightful forest bread-fruit other wide-spreading trees, passing many fine tarrow patches, at the distance half a mile the marsh, we came a spring excellent water. manoo the missionary both expressed a great deal disappointment when i spoke terms disapprobation this also as a watering-place--it being altogether too far the shore. our return the spring, we took a different footpath that which we came, ascended a more elevated part the island see the work the missionary, as it was called manoo. this consisted two three enclosures means stakes, the midst the forest, the trees had been cut down several acres, which was cleared planted sweet potatoes tobacco. the enclosures were made, all the labour clearing the forest was done, as manoo remarked, such the wicked disobedient, as had resisted the authority ordinances the white missionary during his residence the island some months previous. since then, the white missionary had returned otaheite, sent this native missionary, who belonged that island, represent him his absence. leaving the enclosures tobacco sweet potatoes, we came into a thicket the trees were overrun the vines the yam, growing wild covered beautiful blue flowers that gave a picturesque appearance the forest, filled it their fragrance. we passed five six stone columns that had been sixty seventy feet high, twenty thirty circumference. they were a dilapidated state, having part been thrown down order the missionaries. manoo told me that they were monuments erected in honour the indian god. several these ruins were standing the side an old burial-place in the edge the woods near the shore. each the graves were neatly enclosed with a wall stone. when we returned the village, i was taken a large frame building called the missionary house, the missionary had prepared a roasted pig some tarrow, our dinner. he designed entertain me after the manner the whites, with this view, had placed our repast a large coarse table that stood in the middle the room with benches round it. when we were seated, he unlocked a chest took it a plate each us, a knife fork, all which were extremely dirty, the knives forks quite covered with rust. this, however, he did not seem remark, although he evidently wished me think that he knew be polite, after the fashion my country people. he acquitted himself pretty well, his own satisfaction, until he attempted use the knife fork--but that was altogether too much him. after making several trials in vain cut his meat, he asked me assist him; finally, before he had half finished his dinner, laid down his clumsy instruments used his fingers. the chief, as many the natives as could get into the room came round us, but none them were invited partake with the missionary myself, except manoo, whilst the hungry crowd stood looking wistfully at us. soon after we had finished our dinner, the captain several the officers landed, we exchanged several articles with the natives their pigs, yams, &c. the following day was their sabbath our saturday, they insisted that we should remain until monday, before any exchange commodities took place. when, however, we declared our determination depart that evening, they began collecting whatever might be acceptable us. hogs various sizes, were brought the beach in great numbers. needles, jack-knives, old clothes, were our articles traffic, than which we could have offered them nothing more valuable. sundown, we had collected thirty forty hogs, a good supply yams. in a few hours more, we might have obtained twice as many upon the same terms. towards the close the day, when the missionary felt assured that it was our determination depart, he asked if i was a doctor, had any skill in medicine; and, although i replied in the negative, insisted upon my going his house see, prescribe his wife, who, he told me, was extremely ill. upon entering his hut, we found her laying a mat the floor; notwithstanding the weather was oppressively warm, she was covered over with a great many pieces the tappa cloth, head all, perspiring most profusely. the missionary, with great gravity, but most unceremoniously, removed all the covering, pointed out me her infirmity, which was nothing more than a common bile, with which she seemed be suffering considerable pain. i declined prescribing, although repeatedly requested do so; at sun-down, we embarked made sail. had it been convenient us remain two days longer at ramitarias, we could have obtained an abundant supply whatever the island produced, a very trifling consideration; but although there was anchorage, it was unsheltered, too near the shore us ride in safety. at six, p.m. the 10th june, we took our departure ramitarias; at day-light, the 13th, made the island toubouai, bearing the northward eastward, about eight leagues us. in getting in with the s.w. part the island, we found an extensive reef, upon which the surf was breaking with great violence. we hauled round the east side, passing two small uninhabited islands, but there was not the slightest appearance a landing-place, the surf breaking heavily as far as we could see. at four, p.m. we anchored the north side, in seven fathoms water, sent boats in search the harbour, along the west shore. in the evening, they returned, having found it, the following morning, we got underway, beat up it. when we had advanced near the opening, through the coral reefs that extend from the shore several miles, a mr. strong, an american, came board, piloted us in through a difficult passage. the channel was narrow, very crooked; but we had not less than three a half fathoms water. our anchorage was within a coral reef, about a mile from the shore, in four a half fathoms. the day previous entering the harbour, we discovered that the head our mainmast was decayed, badly sprung. in this situation, we congratulated ourselves in having found a secure harbour, the water was tolerably smooth, which was very essential in fixing the mast securely. nearly all the inhabitants toubouai, consisting about two hundred, were living the side the island we were anchored, in two different settlements. one them was the residence two otaheite missionaries, who governed in spiritual temporal affairs; at the other, was the residence the king, who, since the coming the missionaries, retained but a small share the power that formerly appertained his station. he lived apparently good terms with the missionaries, fearing their influence with the people, but secretly declaring his aversion them. he was the more afraid offending them, as there was a living example their displeasure constantly before him, in the person one who had formerly exercised the regal authority in the missionary village, which they had divested him disobedience, compelled him live in the condition a common private person. soon after the arrival the missionaries, the people became divided into two parties, one which advocated matrimony, the other the unrestrained indulgence which is practised in a state nature. the first, called themselves the missionary party; the latter, the party the tutiori. after a long struggle the ascendency, the tutiories took up arms retired from the habitable part the island, declaring themselves independent the missionaries. they remained several days undisturbed in their disobedience, when a party was sent bring them terms. the tutiories at first retreated, but finally made a stand, after a slight show resistance, submitted, promising go home live in the observance the missionary precepts. the dethroned king, was at the head the tutiories. at the lower village, as it was called us, the king lived, was a party our countrymen, who had been there a number months building a vessel. they had completed the frame commenced planking, when, unfortunately, a quarrel arose between them the people the missionary village, which terminated in open hostility, the loss several lives. one the white men only, was killed. scarcely had they made peace with the natives, when they quarrelled among themselves, nearly half their number (four five) discontinued their work, waited only an opportunity leave the island. this mutinous disposition a few, paralized the efforts the whole party, it was probable from appearances, that the labour they had bestowed with so much effect, would be entirely lost themselves their employer, captain dana massachusetts, whom we had seen at oahoo. the king myself, became high carnies, (or great friends) the day after our arrival; from that time until our departure, he did everything in his power merit my regard. my mess was constantly supplied with bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, tarrow, bananas; whenever i was shore, he waited upon me everywhere with the most friendly attention. our friendship commenced in the following manner, simple enough, it is true, but i believe it was not the less sincere that account. seeing me with a jack-knife in my hand, he expressed a wish look at it, when i told him that he might have it. he received it, after observing me a moment, put his hand upon my arm remarked, now i will be high carnies. i sincerely reciprocated his kindness, so strongly recommended the disinterested simplicity with which it was proffered. two three days after our arrival, i landed with a view traversing the island. i found king dick, as i used call him, upon a bank coral that stretched out from his house, with a long wooden spear in his hand, looking about in the holes fish. he begged me wait until he had taken one his dinner, he would accompany me. accordingly, having succeeded in a few minutes afterwards, we set off together. the island was two three miles wide, we had not proceeded far, when we came an extensive marsh that runs through the middle it. king dick stopped, insisted upon carrying me over on his back. feeling that it was too menial an office to be performed a king, although an untutored native, i remonstrated with him, positively refused to be carried; but after resisting his importunity some time, he took my musket in his hand, i mounted on his shoulders. the marsh was several hundred yards wide, king dick found his burthen very heavy before he landed me on the opposite side. we there entered upon a romantic extensive plain, covered with cocoa-nut, bread-fruit trees, plantain walks, papayas, &c.; interspersed through which, were numerous huts that appeared to have been long deserted. we traversed this plain miles, with little variation; the same pleasing prospect everywhere presenting itself, when suddenly king dick stopped, made the whole forest ring with the shrill notes his voice. after repeating it several times, he was answered at a distance, soon afterwards, we saw a native making his approaches towards us. king dick said something to him, he ascended a cocoa-nut tree, after the manner the people the marquesas, threw down a sufficient quantity nuts to quench our thirst. he afterwards conducted us to a house there were two women several children. they were delighted to see us, hospitably proffered whatever they had refreshment. they gave us a preparation dried bread-fruit, which king dick ate very heartily, but to me it was scarcely palatable. near the house there were several citron lemon trees, the only ones that i saw on the island. in our route back, we met with large quantities sugar cane in a wild state. we passed the burial-place the village, where, beside two three newly made graves, were rudely carved images placed there in conformity to a native custom, that had not yet been abolished the influence the missionaries. when we arrived at king dick's house, we found dinner waiting us. it consisted the fish he had taken in the morning before our departure, roasted fowls, bread-fruit, tarrow, &c. the whole was wrapped up in plantain leaves, placed on a mat upon the floor, around which, we all seated ourselves, there being a number visiters present. during our repast, king dick went frequently to a large chest, he kept a bottle rum i had given him, and, after proffering me the bottle, he would help himself, lock it up in the chest again, without taking the least notice the rest his visiters. no miser ever guarded his treasure more penuriously than the king did his bottle rum; not only on this, but all other occasions. his house was large, a lounging place all the idle people his village; and, although there were always a number present when i made my visits, he never failed to offer me a portion his favourite beverage, the wistful lookers-on received not the slightest notice. i once ventured to propose to him to give some to his friends, but he said no, it was too good them. when, after a week's stay at toubouai, our departure was spoken of, king dick expressed the liveliest regret, proposed going with us. we told him that he would never be able to get back again; to which he replied, that he should not care about returning. the day before we left, he sent me, on board, an abundant sea-stock, fruits vegetables, a good-sized hog. as a parting gift, i dressed him up in an old uniform mine, that seemed to give him infinite pleasure. to his presents, his wife added several pieces the tappa cloth, some which, were as fine specimens the native manufacture, as i ever met with anywhere. at toubouai, we added considerably to our collection curiosities. the most ingeniously wrought article, was a lash, used the natives brushing the flies off their backs. the handles were carved to represent a man's face, some animal familiar to them. the lash itself, was, in several strands, finely braided from twine the cocoa-nut husk. the natives were, in general, naked, except a wrapper round their waists, had a sickly feeble look. the island is very fertile, producing, in many parts, large quantities cocoa-nut bread-fruit, is capable, without further improvement, sustaining some thousands people. the population has greatly diminished within the recollection recent visiters. it must have been much greater when visited the mutineers the bounty, who built a fort on the island, but afterwards became dissatisfied, left it in consequence the treacherous hostile character the natives. the only survivor those guilty men, who is now the patriarch pitcairn's island, states, that they had war with the natives previous to leaving toubouai, that they killed a great many them. his estimate the inhabitants at that time, is fifteen thousand. king dick told me, that the huts we saw on the side the island opposite to where we anchored, were once inhabited people who were all dead. we obtained wood water a good quality, without much labour. hogs were scarce, we got none but what were presented to us. the natives gave us a few domestic fowls, in exchange for writing paper. the paper was used the women for making paste-board for a bonnet, that had just been introduced amongst them the wives the otaheite missionaries. on the island toubouai, there is a tree, the bark which, makes excellent cordage. it is produced in great abundance, grows to the size six eight inches in diameter. after the ship builders were interrupted in their work, the discontent some the party, the remainder made a rope-walk, devoted themselves to making rope this bark. they had several small cables, a considerable quantity rope. we purchased some, found it to wear nearly, quite, as well as hemp. arrow root, grows spontaneously upon the island, has been taken away several vessels, as an article commerce. we were informed that the scarcity hogs was in consequence a great many having been carried off recently, a vessel belonging to the missionaries. also, that they lay all the small islands under contribution, annually send their small vessels to collect the hogs, which they barrel, send to port jackson. this may be true not. it was positively asserted. our stock bread was nearly exhausted, what remained, was in a damaged state. having failed in all our attempts to obtain a supply yams, that would enable us to reach the coast south america, an examination was held upon the bread, to the end, that we might adopt such expedients as should be deemed most proper. valparaiso, was our most direct port; there was but one inhabited island (oparro,) in our way, that at some distance from a straight course. to avoid, however, so disagreeable a circumstance as being without bread, we determined to touch at oparro, get whatever we could for a substitute. accordingly, we put to sea on the 22d june, on the 25th, made oparro, a little before day-light, five leagues from us. when we came near, its appearance was rude inhospitable in the extreme, being a mass rugged mountains, about a thousand feet high, eight ten miles in circumference. on the north-west side, there were no signs inhabitants. the mountains rose almost perpendicularly from the ocean, we sounded frequently, close to the shore, without getting bottom. in rounding the island, to the northward eastward, we opened a valley, where there was a number huts, some patches tarrow. a boat was sent in shore, two the natives came on board, who informed us that there was a harbour to the eastward. we continued on, after landing at one two other small valleys, where there were huts tarrow patches, opened a beautiful deep bay, that had an appearance great fertility. soon afterwards, an englishman came on board, offered to pilot us in. he had not advanced far with the vessel, before she grounded on a bank coral, but fell off immediately, on putting the helm down throwing all aback. we were everywhere surrounded shoals coral, fearful accidents, came to outside the harbour, where we had ten fathoms water on one side, five on the other. the boats were sent off immediately, in search tarrow. it was planted everywhere, in large patches, where there was a small valley, through which a stream water found its way from the mountains to the sea, at a distance, the hills were green with another species we had not before seen, called mountain tarrow. the latter is superior to the low land tarrow, will keep longer at sea. when we landed in the bay, which was several miles deep, we found two different missionary establishments, occupied natives otaheite. no one else, that we saw, seemed to have any authority. they permitted us to dig as much tarrow as we pleased, without asking any return for it, night, we had as much on board as we knew what to do with. one the missionary establishments was situated at the extreme depth the bay. on landing there, i was met the missionaries themselves, conducted to their house, where their wives, who were also from otaheite, received me, dressed in their own island costume, with large straw bonnets on their heads. after remaining with them for a few minutes, i repaired to the place where the boats' crew were employed in collecting tarrow. a group natives, male female, had assembled round, none whom, could be prevailed upon the rewards we offered them, to assist our people in their occupation. they had a sickly look, almost without an exception. their dress differed altogether from any we had before seen. it consisted a heavy mat grass, weighing from ten to fifteen pounds, which was thrown over their shoulders, another light mat the same material, for the loins. their deportment was modest retiring, they evinced a disposition to have but little intercourse with us. a few their houses were scattered about upon the hills. they were extremely miserable, might, without disparagement, be compared to dog kennels. they were long, very narrow, about three four feet high, so that when one entered them, it was necessary to get down upon the hands knees. the otaheite missionaries were distinguished from the natives, wearing the tappa cloth, their own island, an old cloth jacket they had obtained from white visiters. i added something to their stock clothes, before i took leave them, for which, they gave me many thanks. when i returned on board, i found the other two missionaries there, several the natives, who had accompanied the captain. they spent the night with us, the next morning, showed us where to obtain a quantity the mountain tarrow. it is large, very much resembles the west india yam. for a vessel long at sea, requiring vegetables, there is none more valuable. the englishman who came on board to act as our pilot, was residing at the island, in charge a party which had been left there the english consul at the sandwich islands, to collect beach la mer, a valuable article commerce, at canton. the collecting sandal-wood, was also to be an object their attention; but they told us, that both were scarce, difficult to obtain--a statement, we considered, doubtful veracity. at 2, p.m., on the 27th june, we got underway, made sail for valparaiso, which is distant from oparro, about three thousand five hundred miles. this island, which is called the discoverer, oparro, is called the natives, lapa. it is situated in latitude 27 degrees 34 minutes south, west longitude 144 degrees. at 5, p.m., we saw the islands, called quiros, los corones, hauled up, until eight, to clear them. for the first three days after we sailed, it blew a severe gale from the westward, after which, it became more moderate, but nearly all our passage to valparaiso, was wet boisterous. it was less disagreeable, however, than we anticipated, as the wind was almost constantly fair. we had the more reason to apprehend a severe trial our fortitude, as it was in the dead winter that we were advancing into a high latitude, after having been a long time within the tropics, besides that, our sails rigging were very much worn, some our articles provisions were quite exhausted, others, the first necessity, reduced to a small quantity. if, therefore, we had encountered tedious gales ahead, we must have suffered greatly in our shattered ill-fitted condition. at 4, p.m., on the 19th july, we made the island mas a fuera, on the coast chili, seventy miles from us, at midnight, passed close to it. at day-light, juan fernandes, was in sight, fifty miles off. we passed it a little after meridian. it is very mountainous, but well covered with trees. the interesting fable robinson crusoe's adventures, has given it a lasting fame, rendered it an object curiosity to all who visit this part the pacific ocean. it is very fertile, has been tolerably well cultivated. the spanish captain-general chili, formerly made it a place banishment, after the revolution took place in that country, it was appropriated to the same purpose, the patriots royalists, as they alternately came into power. a considerable town was built the exiles, who were sent there at different times, the finest fruits chili are produced in great abundance. the cattle that have been left upon the island, are running wild in large herds, several persons have found it profitable to send parties there to kill them for their hides. the island produces some sandal-wood, but it is small, has never been collected in large quantities. fish, that very much resemble our codfish, a variety other kinds are taken in the greatest abundance around juan fernandez mas a fuera. it is believed that if a fishery were established there some our enterprising countrymen, it would be found a source great emolument. the privileges that might be considered necessary for the prosperity a company formed with this object, could easily be obtained from the government chili, there is no apparent cause the most successful results should not be realized. it seems only necessary to call the attention our capitalists to this subject, to have all its advantages secured to our country. it has a fine harbour for the prevailing winds summer, but in the winter season, when the winds set in from the northward, it is exposed. it lies a little more than three hundred miles from the coast chili, in the summer months i have known open boats to pass between it valparaiso. on the 23d july, we anchored in the harbour valparaiso, a little before day-light, to the gratification our friends, who were becoming very much alarmed for our safety, no information us having been received during the whole period our absence. thus, in a vessel 180 tons burthen, poorly fitted, having on board only about four months' provisions, when we sailed from the coast peru, we performed a cruise upwards eleven months in an unfrequented ocean, rendering to our countrymen, many the people whom we visited, important benefits, besides realizing the most successful results in the primary object our cruise. its beneficial effects will long be felt our countrymen, who are engaged in the whale-fishery; and, although we suffered many hardships, privations, dangers, we were happy in being the instruments, in the hands providence our government, proving that crime cannot go unpunished in the remotest part the earth, that no situation is so perilous as to justify despair.

I had been astonished to note how little real\ninterest was taken in him or his fame, and how seldom his works were\nmet with in the houses of the rich or poor in the very neighbourhood.\n\nIt was natural that, coming to reside in the Lake country, I should\nendeavour to find out what of Wordsworth's memory among the {2} men\nof the Dales still lingered on.--how far he was still a moving\npresence among them,--how far his works had made their way into the\ncottages and farm-houses of the valleys.\n\nBut if a certain love of the humorous induced me to enter into or\nfollow up conversations with the few still living among the peasants\nwho were in the habit of seeing Wordsworth in the flesh, there was\nalso a genuine wish to endeavour to find out how far the race of\nWestmoreland and Cumberland farm-folk--the 'Matthews' and the\n'Michaels' of the poet as described by him--were real or fancy\npictures, or how far the characters of the dalesmen had been altered\nin any remarkable manner by tourist influences during the thirty-two\nyears that have passed since the aged poet was laid to rest.\n\nFor notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Ruskin, writing in 1876, had\nsaid 'that the Border peasantry (painted with absolute fidelity by\nScott and Wordsworth)' are, as hitherto, a scarcely injured\nrace,--that in his fields at Coniston he had men who might have\nfought with Henry V. at Agincourt without being distinguished from\nany of his knights,--that he could take his tradesmen's {3} word for\na thousand pounds, and need never latch his garden gate, nor fear\nmolestation in wood or on moor, for his girl guests; the more one\nwent about seeking for such good life and manners and simple piety as\nWordsworth knew and described in fell-side homes, or such generous\nunselfishness and nobility among the Dale farmers as would seem to\nhave been contemporaries of the poet, the more one was a little\nsaddened to find a characteristic something faded away, and a certain\nbeauty vanished that the simple retirement of old valley-days of\nfifty years ago gave to the men amongst whom Wordsworth lived.  The\nstrangers with their gifts of gold, their vulgarity, and their\nrequirements, have much to answer for in the matter.  But it is true\nthat the decent exterior, the shrewd wit, and the manly independence\nand natural knightliness of the men of the soil is to a large extent\nresponsible for raising expectations of nobility of life and morals,\nthe expectation of which would be justified by no other peasant class\nin England, and which, by raising an unfair standard for comparison,\nought to be prepared for some disappointment.  All said and done they\nare Nature's gentlefolk still.\n\n{4}\n\nOne's walks and talks with the few who remember Wordsworth, or\n_Wudsworth_ as they always call him, have done little to find out\nmore than the impression that they as outsiders formed of him, but it\nallowed one to grasp by the hand a few of those natural noblemen who\nby their presence still give testimony to a time and a race of men\nand women fast fading away, and in need already of the immortality of\nlofty tradition that Wordsworth has accorded them.\n\nWhile these few of his still living peasant contemporaries show us\nthe sort of atmosphere of severely simple life, hand-in-hand with a\n'joy in wildest commonalty spread,' that made some of Wordsworth's\npoems possible, I think the facts that they seem to establish of\nWordsworth's seclusion, and the distance he seems to have kept from\nthem and their cottage homes, not a little interesting.  For they\npoint to the suggestion that the poet lived so separate and apart\nfrom them, so seldom entered the 'huts where poor men lie,' or mixed\nwith the fell-side folk at their sports and junketings, that he was\nenabled, in his swift selection and appreciation of the good and pure\nand true in their surroundings, to forget, quite honestly perhaps,\n{5} the faults of the people among whom he lived.\n\nBe that as it may, this paper aims at establishing no new doctrine or\nview about the man, but at simply putting on record reminiscences\nstill in the minds of some of those who often saw him, knew his\nfancies and his ways (as only servants know the fancies and ways of\ntheir master), and spoke with him sixty, fifty, or forty years ago.[1]\n\n\n[1] This paper was written in 1881 and was read at the annual meeting\nof the Wordsworth Society in London in 1882--Robert Browning in the\nchair.\n\n\nThese reminiscences may seem worthless to many, just from the fact\nthat they are the words of outsiders.  They will seem to others of\ninterest for that very reason.  And this much must be said, they are\ntrustworthy records from true mouths.  The native _love of truth_, or\nperhaps better, the native _dislike ever to hazard suggestion_, or to\nspeak _without book_, is guarantee for that.  To ask questions in\nWestmoreland is the reverse of asking them of Syrian fellaheen and\nEgyptian dragomans.  The Cumberland mind is not inventive, nor swift\nto anticipate the answer you wish, and one is always brought up sharp\nwith--\n\n'Nay, I wadnt say that nayther':\n\n{6}\n\n'Nay, I'se not sartain aboot that':\n\n'Might bea, but not to my knowledge howivver:\n\n'Its nea good my saaing I kna that, when I doant, noo than,'--and so\non.\n\n\nTwenty summers had let the daisies blossom round Wordsworth's grave,\nwhen, in 1870, I heard of and saw the old lady who had once been in\nservice at Rydal Mount, and was now a lodging-house keeper at\nGrasmere.  She shall be called as first witness, but what kind of\npractical and unimaginative mind she had may be gathered from the\nfollowing anecdote.  My sister came in from a late evening walk, and\nsaid, 'O Mrs. D----, have you seen the wonderful sunset?'  The good\nlady turned sharply round, and drawing herself to her full height, as\nif mortally offended, answered, 'No, Miss R----, I'm a tidy cook, I\nknow, and, 'they say,' a decentish body for a landlady, and sic-like,\nbut I nivver bodder nowt aboot sunsets or them sort of things,\nthey're nowt ataw i' my line.'  Her reminiscence of Wordsworth was as\nworthy of tradition as it was explanatory, from her point of view, of\nthe method in which Wordsworth composed, and {7} was helped in his\nlabours by his enthusiastic sister.\n\n'Well you kna,' were her words, 'Mr. Wordsworth went bumming and\nbooing about, and she, Miss Dorothy, kept close behint him, and she\npicked up the bits as he let 'em fall, and tak 'em down, and put 'em\non paper for him.  And you med,' continued the good dame, 'be very\nwell sure as how she didn't understand nor make sense out of 'em, and\nI doubt that he [Wordsworth] didn't kna much aboot them either\nhimself, but, howivver, there's a gay lock o' fowk as wad, I dar say.'\n\nAnd here it will be well to put in a caution.  The vernacular of the\nLake district must be understood a little, or wrong impressions would\nbe got of the people's memory of the bard.  'What was Mr. Wordsworth\nlike in personal appearance?' I once asked of an old retainer, who\nstill lives not far from Rydal Mount.  'He was a ugly-faÃ¤ced man, and\na mean liver,' was the answer.  And when he continued, 'Ay, and he\nwas a deal aboot t' roads, ye kna,' one might have been pardoned if\none had concluded that the Lake poet was a sort of wild man of the\nwoods, an ugly customer of desperate life, or {8} highwayman of\nvagrant habit.  All that was really meant when translated was, that\nhe was a man of marked features, and led a very simple life in\nmatters of food and raiment.\n\n\nThe next witness I shall call to speak of the poet is none other than\nthe lad whose wont it was to serve the Rydal Mount kitchen with meat,\nweek in week out, in the poet's days.  A grey-haired man himself now,\nhis chief memory of Wordsworth is that of a tall man, 'rather a\nfineish man in build, with a bit of a stoop, and a deal of grey hair\nupon his head.'\n\nIn some of the days of close analysis that are coming upon us, poets\nwill perhaps be found to have depended for the particular colour of\ntheir poems, or turns and cast of thought, upon the kind of\nfood--vegetable or animal--that they mostly subsisted on.  It will be\nwell to chronicle the fact that Wordsworth had an antipathy to veal,\nbut was very partial to legs--'lived on legs, you med amost say.'\nBut as my friend added, almost in the same breath, that the poet was\n'a great walker i' t' daÃ¤les,' he had uttered unconsciously a double\ntruth.\n\nThe next fact that remained clear and distinct in the butcher's mind\nwas, that {9} whenever you met the poet he was sure to be 'quite\n[pronounced white] plainly dressed.' Sometimes in a round blue cloak;\nsometimes wearing a big wideawake, or a bit of an old boxer, but\nplainly dressed, almost 'poorly dressed, ya mun saay, at the best o'\ntimes.'  'But for aw that, he was quite an object man,' he added,\nmeaning that there was a dignity that needed no dressing to set it\noff, I suppose, in the poet's mien and manner.  It was interesting to\nhear, too, how different Wordsworth had seemed in his grave silent\nway of passing children without a word, from 'li'le Hartley\nColeridge,' with his constant salutation, uncertain gait, his head on\none side, his walking-stick suddenly shouldered, and then his frantic\nlittle rushes along the road, between the pauses of his thought.\n'Many's the time,' said my friend, 'that me and my sister has run\nourselves intil a lather to git clear fra Hartley, for we allays\nthowt, ya kna, when he started running he was efter us.  But as fur\nMister Wudsworth, he'd pass you, same as if yan was nobbut a stean.\nHe niver cared for childer, however; yan may be certain of that, for\ndidn't I have to pass him four times in t' week, up to the door wi'\nmeat?  And he niver oncst said {10} owt.  Ye're well aware, if he'd\nbeen fond of children he 'ud 'a spoke.'\n\nBut Mrs. Wordsworth had made her impressions too on the youth's mind.\n'As for Mrs. Wudsworth, she was plainer in her ways than he was.  The\nplainest wooman in these parts,--for aw the warld the bettermer part\nof an auld farm-body.'  He intended nothing disrespectful by this\nsimile, he only wished to say she was simple in manner and dress.\nBut if Mrs. Wordsworth's personal appearance had impressed him, her\npowers of housekeeping had impressed him more.  She was very\npersevering, and 'terb'le particular in her accounts, never allowed\nyou an inch in the butching-book.'  It did not raise one's opinion of\nLake country butcher morality to find this a grievance, but the man\nas he spoke seemed to think a little sorely of those old-fashioned\ndays, when mistresses, not cooks, took supervision of the household\neconomies.\n\n\nI bade my friend good-day, and the last words I heard were, 'But Mr.\nWudsworth _was quite an object man, mind ye_.'\n\n\nIt is an easy transition from butcher-boy to gardener's lad, and I\nwill now detail a {11} conversation I had with one who, in this\nlatter capacity at Rydal Mount, saw the poet daily for some years.\n\nIt was Easter Monday, and I knew that the one-time gardener's lad at\nRydal Mount had grown into a vale-renowned keeper of a vale-renowned\nbeer-house.  I had doubts as to calling on this particular day, for\nEaster Monday and beer go much together in our Lake country.  But I\nwas half reassured by a friend who said, 'Well, he gets drunk three\ntimes a day, but taks t' air atween whiles, and if you catch him\nairing he will be verra civil, but it's a bad day to find him sober,\nthis.'  I explained that I wanted to talk with him of old\nWordsworthian days.  'Aw, it's Wudsworth you're a gaan to see about?\nIf that's the game, you're reet enuff, for, drunk or sober, he can\ncrack away a deal upon Mr. Wudsworth.  An' i'se not so varry seuer\nbut what he's best drunk a li'le bit.'  I was reassured, and soon\nfound myself sitting on the stone ale-bench outside the public-house,\nthe best of friends with a man who had been apparently grossly\nlibelled--for he was as sober as a judge--and whose eye fairly\ntwinkled as he spoke of the Rydal garden days.\n\n{12}\n\n'You see, blessed barn, it's a lock o' daÃ¤ys sin', but I remember\nthem daÃ¤ys, for I was put by my master to the Rydal Mount as\ngardener-boy to keep me fra bad waays.  And I remember one John\nWudsworth, Mr. Wudsworth's nevi, parson he was, dead, like eneuf,\nafore this.  Well, he was stayin' there along o' his missus, first\nweek as I was boy there, and I was ter'ble curious, and was like\nenough to hev bin drowned, for they had a bath, filled regular o'\nnights, up above, ya kna, with a sort of curtainment all round it.\nAnd blowed if I didn't watch butler fill it, and then goa in and pull\nstring, and down came t' watter, and I was 'maazed as owt, and I\nscreamed, and Mr. John come and fun' me, and saÃ¤ved my life.  Eh,\nblessed barn, them was daÃ¤ys lang sen'.'\n\nI asked whether Mr. Wordsworth was much thought of.  He replied,\n'Latterly, but we thowt li'le eneuf on him.  He was nowt to li'le\nHartley.  Li'le Hartley was a philosopher, you see; Wudsworth was a\npoet.  Ter'ble girt difference betwixt them two wayses, ye kna.'  I\nasked whether he had ever found that poems of Mr. Wordsworth were\nread in the cottages, whether he had read them himself.  'Well you\nsee, blessed barn, {13} there's pomes and pomes, and Wudsworth's was\nnot for sec as us.  I never did see his pomes--not as I can speak to\nin any man's house in these parts, but,' he added, 'ye kna there's\nbits in t' papers fra time to time bearing his naame.'\n\nThis unpopularity of Wordsworth's poems among the peasantry was\nstrangely corroborated that very same day by an old man whom I met on\nthe road, who said he had often seen the poet, and had once been\npresent and heard him make a long speech, and that was at the laying\nof the foundation of the Boys' Schoolroom at Bowness, which was built\nby one Mr. Bolton of Storrs Hall.\n\nOn that occasion Mr. 'Wudsworth talked lang and weel eneuf,' and he\nremembered that he 'had put a pome he had written into a bottle wi'\nsome coins in the hollow of the foundation-stone.'\n\nI asked him whether he had ever seen or read any of the poet's works,\nand he answered, 'Nay, not likely; for Wudsworth wasn't a man as\nwreat on separate bits, saÃ¤me as Hartley Coleridge, and was niver a\nfrequenter of public-houses, or owt of that sort.'  But he added, 'He\nwas a good writer, he supposed, and he was a man folks {14} thowt a\ndeal on i' t' dale: he was sic a weel-meaning, decent, quiet man.'\n\nBut to return to my host at the public.  Wordsworth, in his opinion,\nwas not fond of children, nor animals.  He would come round the\ngarden, but never 'say nowt.'  Sometimes, but this was seldom, he\nwould say, 'Oh! you're planting peas?' or, 'Where are you setting\nonions?'  but only as a master would ask a question of a servant.  He\nhad, he said, never seen him out of temper once, neither in the\ngarden, nor when he was along o' Miss Dorothy in her invalid chair.\nBut, he added, 'What went on i' t' hoose I can't speak till'; meaning\nthat as an outdoor servant he had no sufficiently accurate knowledge\nof the in-door life to warrant his speaking of it.  Wordsworth was\nnot an early riser, had no particular flower he was fondest of that\nhe could speak to; never was heard to sing or whistle a tune in his\nlife; there 'was noa two words about that, though he bummed a\ndeal';--of this more presently.\n\n'He was a plain man, plainly dressed, and so was she, ya mun kna.\nBut eh, blessed barn! he was fond o' his own childer, and fond o'\nDorothy, especially when she was {15} faculty strucken, poor thing;\nand as for his wife, there was noa two words about their being truly\ncompanionable; and Wudsworth was a silent man wi'out a doubt, but he\nwas not aboon bein' tender and quite monstrable [demonstrative] at\ntimes in his oan family.'\n\nI asked about Mr. Wordsworth's powers of observation.  Had he noticed\nin his garden walks how he stooped down and took this or that flower,\nor smelt this or that herb?  (I have heard since that the poet's\nsense of smell was limited.)  'Na, he wadna speak to that, but Mr.\nWudsworth was what you might call a vara practical-eyed man, a man as\nseemed to see aw that was stirrin'.'\n\nPerhaps the most interesting bit of information I obtained, before\nour pleasant chat was at an end, was a description of the way in\nwhich the poet composed on the grass terrace at Rydal Mount.  'Eh!\nblessed barn,' my informant continued, 'I think I can see him at it\nnow.  He was ter'ble thrang with visitors and folks, you mun kna, at\ntimes, but if he could git awa fra them for a spell, he was out upon\nhis gres walk; and then he would set his head a bit forrad, and put\nhis hands behint his back.  And then he would start a bumming, and it\nwas bum, bum, bum, {16} stop; then bum, bum, bum reet down till\nt'other end, and then he'd set down and git a bit o' paper out and\nwrite a bit; and then he git up, and bum, bum, bum, and goa on\nbumming for long enough right down and back agean.  I suppose, ya\nkna, the bumming helped him out a bit.  However, his lips was always\ngoan' whoale time he was upon the gres walk.  He was a kind mon,\nthere's no two words about that: if any one was sick i' the plaace,\nhe wad be off to see til 'em.'\n\nAnd so ended my Easter Monday talk with the poet's quondam gardener's\nboy, the now typical beerhouse-keeper, half pleased, half proud, to\nremember his old master in such service as he rendered him, in the\ndays when it was judged that to keep a boy out of mischief and from\nbad company it was advisable to get him a place at Rydal Mount.\n\n\nI must ask you next to take a seat with me in a waller's cottage.  If\ntea and bread and butter is offered, you had better take it also, it\nis almost sure to be pressed upon you, and it is of the best.  I will\nbe interrogator, only by way of introduction saying, that our host is\na splendid type of the real Westmoreland {17} gentleman labourer, who\nwas in his days a wrestler too, and whose occupation at the building\nof _Foxhow_ and _Fiddler's Farm_ in the Rydal Valley, often allowed\nhim to see the poet in old times.\n\n'Well, George, what sort o' a man in personal appearance was Mr.\nWordsworth?'\n\n'He was what you might ca' a ugly man,--mak of John Rigg much,--much\nabout seame height, 6 feet or 6 feet 2,--smaller, but deal rougher in\nthe face.'\n\nI knew John Rigg by sight, and can fancy from the pictures of the\npoet that the likeness is striking in the brow and profile.\n\n'But he was,' continued George, 'numbledy in t' kneas, walked\nnumbledy, ye kna, but that might o' wussened wi' age.'  In George's\nmind age accounted for most of the peculiarities he had noticed in\nthe poet, but George's memory could go back fifty years, and he ought\nto have remembered Wordsworth as hale and hearty.  'He wozn't a man\nas said a deal to common fwoak.  But he talked a deal to hissen.  I\noften seead his lips a gaÃ¤in', and he'd a deal o' mumblin' to hissel,\nand 'ud stop short and be a lookin' down upo' the ground, as if he\nwas in a thinkin' waÃ¤y.  But that might ha' growed on him wi' age,\nan' aw, ye kna.'\n\n{18}\n\nHow true, thought I, must have been the poet's knowledge of himself.\n\n  And who is he with modest looks,\n    And clad in sober russet gown?\n  He murmurs by the running brooks,\n    A music sweeter than their own;\n  He is retired as noontide dew,\n  Or fountain in a noonday grove.\n\nAnd indeed, in all the reminiscences I have obtained among the\npeasantry, these lines force themselves upon one as corroborated by\ntheir evidence.\n\n'He' [Mr. Wordsworth], continued George, 'was a deal upo' the road,\nwould goa moast days to L'Ambleside i' his cloak and umbrella, and in\nlater times fwoaks would stare and gaum to see him pass, not that we\nthowt much to him hereaboots, but they was straÃ¤ngers, ye see.'\n\nIt is curious, though natural, perhaps, to find a sort of disbelief\namong the natives in the poet's greatness, owing somewhat to the fact\nthat it 'was straÃ¤ngers as set such store by him.'  They distrust\nstrangers still, almost as much as they did in old Border-times.\n\nBut the secret of Wordsworth's unpopularity with the dalesmen seems\nto have been that he was shy and retired, and not {19} one who mixed\nfreely or talked much with them.\n\n'We woz,' said George, 'noan of us very fond on him; eh, dear! quite\na different man from li'le Hartley.  He wozn't a man as was very\ncompannable, ye kna.  He was fond o' steanes and mortar, though,' he\nadded.  'It was in '48, year of revolution, one Frost, they ca'd him\nrebellious (Monmouth), and a doment in Ireland.  I mind we was at wuk\nat Fiddler's Farm, and Muster Wudsworth 'ud come down maist days, and\nhe sed \"it sud be ca'ed Model Farm,\" and sa it was.'\n\nSpeaking of Foxhow, he said, 'He and the Doctor [Dr. Arnold], you've\nmappen hard tell o' t' Doctor,--well, he and the Doctor was much i'\nyan anudder's company; and Wudsworth was a girt un for chimleys, had\nsummut to saay in the makkin' of a deal of 'em hereaboot.  There was\n'maist all the chimleys Rydal way built efter his mind.  I can mind\nhe and the Doctor had girt argiments aboot the chimleys time we was\nbuilding Foxhow, and Wudsworth sed he liked a bit o' colour in 'em.\nAnd that the chimley coigns sud be natural headed and natural bedded,\na lile bit red and a lile bit yallar.  For there is a bit of colour\ni' t' quarry stean {20} up Easedale way.  And heed a girt fancy an'\naw for chimleys square up hauf way, and round t'other.  And so we\nbuilt 'em that road.'  It was amusing to find that the house\nchimney-stacks up Rydal way are in truth so many breathing monuments\nof the bard.  The man who with his face to the Continent passed in\nthat sunny pure July morn of 1803 over Westminster Bridge, and\nnoticed with joy the smokeless air, rejoiced also to sit 'without\nemotion, hope, or aim, by his half-kitchen and half-parlour fire' at\nTown End, and wherever he went seems to have noted with an eye of love\n\n  The smoke forth issuing whence and how it may,\n  Like wreaths of vapour without stain or blot.\n\n\nBut if from the highland huts he had observed how intermittently the\nblue smoke-curls rose and fell, he was most pleased to watch on a\nstill day the tremulous upward pillars of smoke that rose from the\ncottages of his native dale.  In his _Guide to the Lakes_ (page 44)\nWordsworth has said, 'The singular beauty of the chimneys will not\nescape the eye of the attentive traveller.  The low square\nquadrangular form is often surmounted by a tall cylinder, giving to\nthe cottage chimney {21} the most beautiful shape that is ever seen.\nNor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a\npleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the\nliving column of smoke ascending from it through the still air.'\n\nAnd my friend George's memory of Mr. Wordsworth's dictum about the\nneed of having the chimney coign 'natural headed and natural bedded,\na lile bit red and a lile bit yaller' is again found to be true to\nthe life from a passage in the same _Guide to the Lakes_ (p. 60), in\nwhich the poet, after stating that the principle that ought to\ndetermine the position, size, and architecture of a house (viz., that\nit should be so constructed as to admit of being incorporated into\nthe scenery of nature) should also determine its colour, goes on to\nsay 'that since the chief defect of colour in the Lake country is an\nover-prevalence of bluish-tint, to counteract this the colour of\nhouses should be of a warmer tone than the native rock allows'; and\nadds, 'But where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by an\niron tinge, the colours cannot be too closely imitated, and will be\nproduced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry.'\nHow beautiful the {22} colouring of the Rydal quarry stone is, and\nhow dutifully the son of the poet carried out his father's will in\nhis recent rebuilding of a family residence near Foxhow, may be\njudged by all who glance at the cylindrical chimneys, or look at the\nnatural material that forms the panels of the porch of the\n'Stepping-stones' under Loughrigg.\n\nI rose to go, but George detained me.  For he was proud to remember\nthat upon one occasion Mr. Wudsworth had keenly watched him as he put\nforth his feats of strength in the wrestling ring at Ambleside, 'in\nthe chuchyard, day efter t' fair, forty or fifty years sen,' and had\npassed a remark upon him.  It was in the days 'when fowks wrestled\nfor nowt no mair than a bit o' leather strap.'  And George had\n'coomed to pit,' as the saying is, and 'Efter comin agaen ya man and\nthrowin' him, and anudder and throwin' him,' was last man in against\na noted wrestler, one Tom Chapman.  He had agreed for one fall.  Mr.\nWordsworth was 'leukin' on.'  George and his antagonist 'com'\ntogether, and Chapman fell.  'And I mind that I was mair pleased wi'\nMr. Wudsworth's word than wi' t' strap (or belt), for fowks tell't me\nthat he keepit {23} saying, 'He must be a powerful young man that.\nHe must be a strong young man.'\n\n\nSo ends our chat with honest George, the waller.  We will next\ninterview a man who at one time, for more than eleven years, saw\nWordsworth almost daily.  This was in the days that Hartley Coleridge\nlived at the Nab Cottage, or, as our friend puts it (with a touch of\nmenagerie suggestion in it), 'i' t' daays when _he kep' li'le\nHartley_ at t' Nab,'--for our friend was Coleridge's landlord.  I had\nconsiderable difficulty here, as in almost all my interviews with the\ngood folk, of keeping to the object or subject in hand.  For li'le\nHartley's ghost was always coming to the front.  'NaÃ¤y, naÃ¤y, I\ncannot say a deal to that, but ye kna li'le Hartley would do\nso-and-so.  Li'le Hartley was t' yan for them.  If it had been\nHartley, noo, I could ha' tell't ye a deal.'  And so on.\n\nBut in this particular instance my difficulty was trebled, for my\nfriend evidently nursed the idea that Wordsworth had got most of 'his\npotry out of Hartley,' and had in return dealt very hardly with him,\nin the matter of admonishment and advice, while at the same time Mrs.\nWordsworth, in her {24} capacity of common-sense accountant, with a\nstrict dislike to wasteful expenditure or indiscriminate charity, had\nleft something of bitter in his cup of Rydal Mount memories; and the\nold man would gladly enough pass over a Wordsworth leaflet for a\nfolio page of li'le Hartley.  But he too would be true in his speech,\nand would speak as he 'kna'ed,' neither more nor less.  In his\njudgment Mr. Wordsworth was a 'plainish-faaced man, but a fine man,\ntall and lish (active), and allus aboot t' roads.  He wasn't a man o'\nmany words, wad walk by you times eneuf wi'out sayin' owt particler\nwhen he was studyin'.  He was allus studyin' and you med see his lips\ngaen as he went aboot t' roads.  He did most of his study upo' the\nroads.  I suppose,' he added, 'he was a cliverish man, but he wasn't\nset much on by nin on us.  He lent Hartley a deal o' his beuks, it's\nsartain, but Hartley helped him a deal, I understand, did t' best\npart o' his poems for him, sae t' sayin' is.'\n\n'He wad often come i' t' efterneun and hev a talk at t' Nab, and\nwould gang oot wi' Hartley takkin' him by t' arm for long eneuf.  And\nwhen Hartley was laid by at t' last, Muster Wudsworth com doon ivery\n{25} day to see him, and took communion wi' him at t' last.'\n\n'Then Mr. Wordsworth and Hartley Coleridge were great friends?' I\nasked.\n\n'Nay, nay, I doant think li'le Hartley ever set much by him, newer\nwas verra friendly, I doubt.  Ye see, he [Mr. Wordsworth] was sae\nhard upon him, sae verra hard upon him, gev him sae much hard\npreaching aboot his ways.'\n\n'Well, but Mrs. Wordsworth was kind to Hartley?' I said.\n\n'Mappen she was bit I nivver saw it.  She was' [and here the old man\nspoke very deliberately, as if this was the firmest conviction of his\nlife]--'she was verra onpleasant, vara on-pleasant indeed.  A\nclose-fisted woman, that's what she was.'  But further inquiry\nelicited the reason of this personal dislike to the poet's wife, and\na narrative of it will probably win a public verdict for the lady of\nRydal Mount, with damages for libel against the man who so faithfully\nkep' li'le Hartley at the Nab, and so made his lodger's wrongs his\nown.\n\n'Well, you see,' he continued gravely, 'I mind yance I went up to t'\nMount to exe for sattlement of account, for Mrs. Wudsworth paid for\nHartley's keep, time he {26} lodged at t' Nab, and I had fifteen\nshillings i' t' beuk agin Coleridge for moneys I'd lent him different\ntimes.  And she was verra awkard and on-pleasant, and wouldn't\nsattle, ye kna, for she thowt that Hartley had been drinkin' wi' it.\nBut,' he added, 'howiver, I wrote to his mother, as lived in London,\nand she wreat to me and tell't me I was to lend a shilling or two as\nHartley wanted it, and efter that she sattled wi' me for his lodgment\nhersel', but Mrs. Wudsworth was verra on-pleasant.'\n\nI was glad to change a subject that so distressed him, and asked how\nthe poet was generally dressed, and of his habits.  'Wudsworth wore a\nJem Crow, never seed him in a boxer in my life,--a Jem Crow and an\nauld blue cloak was his rig, and _as for his habits, he had noan_,\nniver knew him with a pot i' his hand, or a pipe i' his mouth.  But,'\ncontinued he, 'he was a girt skater for a' that'--(I didn't see the\nconnection of ideas--pipes and beer don't generally make for good\nskating),--'noan better i' these parts--could cut his own name upo'\nt' ice, could Mr. Wudsworth.'\n\nBefore rising to go, I asked, 'Which roads were the favourites of the\npoet?'\n\n{27}\n\n'Well, well, he was ter'ble fond of going along under Loughrigg and\nower by t' Redbank, but he was niver nowt of a mountaineer, allus\nkep' aboot t' roads.'\n\nThis was a bit of news I had not expected, but we will bear it in\nmind, and test its truth in future conversations with the poet's\npeasant contemporaries.\n\n\nOur next talk shall be with one of the most well-informed of the\nWestmoreland builders, and I am indebted to Wordsworth's love of\nskating for an introduction to him.  For making inquiries as to this\npastime of the poet, I had chanced to hear how that Wordsworth had\ngone on one occasion to figure a bit by himself upon the White Moss\nTarn.  How that a predecessor of my friend the builder who lived near\nWhite Moss Tarn had sent a boy to sweep the snow from the ice for\nhim, and how that when the boy returned from his labour he had asked\nhim, 'Well, did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye owt?' and how that the boy with\na grin of content from ear to ear had rejoined, 'Nay, bit I seed him\ntummle, tho'!'\n\nI determined to seek out the builder and have the story first-hand,\nand was well repaid; {28} for I heard something of the poet's gentle\nways that was better than the grotesquely humorous answer of the boy\nwho saw him fall.\n\nThe poet's skate had caught on a stone when he was in full swing, and\nhe came with a crash on to the ice that starred the tarn and the lad,\nwho had thought 'the tummle' a fair exchange for no pay, had been\nimpressed with the quiet way in which Wordsworth had borne his fall.\n'He didn't swear nor say nowt, but he just sot up and said, 'Eh boy,\nthat was a bad fall, wasn't it?'  And now we are walking along\nbriskly towards Grisedale, with the recounter of the story: 'Kna\nWudsworth!  I kent him weel,--why, he larnt me and William Brown to\nskate.  He was a ter'ble girt skater, was Wudsworth now; and he would\nput ya hand i' his breast (he wore a frill shirt i' them daays), and\nt'other hand i' his waistband, same as shepherds dea to keep their\nhands warm, and he would stand up straight and swaay and swing away\ngrandly.'\n\n'Was he fond of any other pastime?' I asked.\n\n'Naay, naay, he was ower feckless i' his hands.  I nivver seed him at\nt' feasts, or wrestling, {29} he hadn't owt of Christopher Wilson in\nhim.  Nivver was on wheels in his life, and wad rayther ha' been a\ntailor upon horseback happen, but he was a gey good un on t' ice,\nwonderful to see, could cut his neame upon it, I've hard tell, but\nnivver seed him do it.'\n\nSo that the rapture of the time when as a boy on Esthwaite's frozen\nlake Wordsworth had\n\n                                    Wheeled about,\n  Proud and exulting like an untired horse\n  That cares not for his home, and shod with steel,\n  Had hissed along the polished ice,\n\nwas continued into manhood's later day; and here was proof that the\nskill which the poet had gained, when\n\n  Not seldom from the uproar he retired,\n  Unto a silent bay, or sportively\n  Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultous throng\n  To cut across the reflex of a star,\n\nwas of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he dwelt.\n\nMy friend had known Wordsworth well, and what was better, knew his\npoems too.  'Here is t' verra spot, you'll mappen hev read it i' t'\nbeuk, where Wudsworth saw Barbara feeding her pet lamb.  She tell't\n{30} me hersel.  I was mending up t' cottage there at t' time.  Eh,\nshe was a bonny lass! they were a fine family a' t' lot o'\nLewthwaites.  She went lang sen and left, but she tell't me t' spot\nwi' her ain lips.'  As I peered through the hedge upon the\nhigh-raised field at my right, I remembered that Barbara Lewthwaite's\nlips were for ever silent now, and recalled how I had heard from the\npastor of a far-away parish that he had been asked by a very\nrefined-looking handsome woman, on her deathbed, to read over to her\nand to her husband the poem of _The Pet Lamb_, and how she had said\nat the end, 'That was written about me.  Mr. Wordsworth often spoke\nto me, and patted my head when I was a child,' and had added with a\nsigh, 'Eh, but he was such a dear kind old man.'\n\nWe passed on in silence till we were near 'Boon beck,' and opposite\nGreenhead ghyll, 'That,' said my companion, 'is a cottage as we used\nto ca' i' these parts t' Village Clock.  Yan, I'se fergitten his\nneame, a shep, lived here, and i' winter days fowks fra far eneuf\nround wad say, \"Is t' leet oot i' t' shep's cottage?\" then you may\nwind t' clock and cover t' fire (for you kna matches was scarce and\n{31} coal to fetch i' them days); and of a morning \"Is t' leet i' t'\nwinder? is t' shep stirrin'?  then ye maunt lig nea langer,\" we used\nto saay.'  My friend did not know that this too was in 't' beuk,' as\nhe called it,--that Wordsworth had described \"the cottage on a spot\nof rising ground,\"\n\n  And from its constant light so regular,\n  And so far seen, the House itself, by all\n  Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,\n  Both old and young, was named the Evening Star.\n\n\nOnward we trudged, entered the pastures leading; to the Grasmere\nCommon that stretches up to the Grisedale Pass, there sat, and had a\ntalk as follows, the Tongue Ghyll Beck murmuring among the budding\ntrees at our feet:\n\n'Why, why, Wudsworth newer said much to t' fowk, quite different fra\nlile Hartley, as knawed t' inside o' t' cottages for miles round, and\nwas welcome i' them a'.  He was distant, ye may saÃ¤y, verra distant.\nHe wasn't made much count on \"nayther i' these parts,\" but efter a\ntime fwoaks began to tak his advice, ye kna, aboot trees, and\nplantin', and cuttin', and buildin' chimleys, and that mak o' things.\nHe hed his say at t' maist o' t' houses i' these parts, and was verra\nparticler fond of round chimleys.'\n\n{32}\n\nIt was delicious this description of the path to fame among his\ncountrymen the poet had taken, but my friend explained himself as he\nwent on:\n\n'He was yan as keppit his head doon and eyes upo' t' ground, and\nmumbling to hissel; but why, why, he 'ud never pass folks draining,\nor ditching, or walling a cottage, but what he'd stop and say, \"Eh\ndear, but it's a pity to move that stean, and doant ya think ya might\nleave that tree?\"[2]  I mind there was a walling chap just going to\nshoot a girt stean to bits wi' powder i' t' grounds at Rydal, and he\ncame up and saaved it, and wreat summat on it.'\n\n'But what was his reason,' I asked, 'for stopping the wallers or\nditchers, or tree-cutters, at their work?'\n\n'Well, well, he couldn't bide to see t' faÃ¤ce o' things altered,[2]\nye kna.  It was all along of him that Grasmere folks have their\nCommon open.  Ye may ga now reet up to t' sky ower Guzedale, wi'out\nliggin' leg {33} to t' fence, and all through him.  He said it was a\npity to enclose it and run walls over it, and the quality backed him,\nand he won.  Fwoaks was angry eneuf, and wreat rhymes aboot it; but\nwhy, why, it's a deal pleasanter for them as walks up Grisedale, ye\nkna, let alean reets o' foddering and goosage for freemen i' Gersmer.'\n\n\n[2] Readers who may chance to have seen the letter Wordsworth wrote\nto the local paper when he heard the news of the first railway\ninvasion of the Lake district, will notice how accurately true this\npiece of testimony is.\n\n\n'But Mr. Wordsworth was a great critic at trees.  I've seen him many\na time lig o' his back for long eneuf to see whedder a branch or a\ntree sud gang or not.  I mind weel I was building Kelbarrer for Miss\nS----, and she telt me I med get to kna Wudsworth's 'pinion.  Sea I\nwent oop til him as he com i' t' way, and he said, \"Ay, ay, t'\nbuilding wad dea, and t' site wad, but it's verra bare, verra bare.\"\n\n'I mind anudder time I was building t' hoose aboon Town End, wi' a\nlock of trees and planting round, and he said to me, \"Well, well,\nyou're fifty years in advance here\": he meant it was grawed up weel.\n\n'And I mind yance upon a time at Hunting Stile thereaway he coomed\nup.  \"Now, Mr. Wudsworth, how will it goa?\" I said.  He answered me,\n\"It'll dea; but where are the trees?\" and I said, \"Oh, it's weel {34}\neneuf for trees, it nobbut wants its whiskers.\"  \"How so?\" said he.\n\"Why, it's a young 'un,\" I said, \"and we doant blame a young 'un for\nnot hevin' it's hair upo' its faace.\"  And he laughed, and he said,\n\"Very good, a very good saying; very true, very true.\"  But he was\nter'ble jealous of new buildings.\n\n'As for Mrs. Wudsworth, why, why, she was a verra plain woman,\nplainest i' these parts, and she was a manasher an' aw, and kepp t'\naccounts.  For ye kna he nivver knew aboot sec things, nayder what he\nhad or what he spent.'\n\nAs we rose to continue our climb, my friend looked at the trees in\nthe little stream-bed below us, and said, 'In my days there was a\ndeal of wild fruit in these parts.  We hed toffee feasts i' t'\nwinter, and cherry feasts i' t' summer,--gey big gedderings at t'\ncherry feasts.'\n\n'Did you ever see Wordsworth at one?'\n\n'Nivver, he nobbut followed ya amusement: that was skating, as I telt\nye.'\n\n'Had he any particular friends among the shepherds?' I asked.\n\n'Nay, nay, not as ever I kent or heard on; but he wozn't a\nmountaineer, was maistly doon below aboot t' road.'\n\n{35}\n\n'But what was his favourite road?'\n\n'Oh, roond by Gersmere and t' Red Bank and heam again, wiowt ony\ndoubt.  He wad gang twice i' t' day roond by Mr. Barber's there.  He\nwas a girt walker roond there, and a'most as girt a eater.  Why, why,\nhe wad git breakfast at heam, poddish or what not, and then come wi'\nMiss Wudsworth roond t' lake to Mr. Barber's, and fall in wi' them,\nand then off and roond agean, and be at Barber's at tea-time, and\nsupper up agean before gaen heam.  And as for her, why Miss\nWudsworth, she wad often come into t' back kitchen and exe for a bit\nof oatcake and butter.  She was fond of oatcake, and butter till it,\nfit to steal it a'most.  Why, why, but she was a ter'ble cliver\nwoman, was that.  She did as much of his potry as he did, and went\ncompletely off it at the latter end wi' studying it, I suppose.  It's\na verra straange thing, noo, that studying didn't run on i' t'\nfamily.'\n\nIt was, I thought, a little hard to expect that the poet should have\nhanded on the torch, or to speak with disrespect of his sons because\nthey only thought in prose.  But it was evidence in my friend, at\nleast, of a profound belief in the genius of the Rydal poet and\ntree-and-building critic of old days.  {36} And it would have been a\nguess shrewdly made that it was Wordsworth's brotherhood with him, in\nthe interests of his builder life, and jealous care for architecture\nin the vales, that had made the bond so strong and the belief in the\npoet so great, and exclusive.  We descended into the valley, took tea\ntogether at the Swan Inn, and chatted on: now learning that\nWordsworth was a regular attendant at Grasmere Church, now that he\nwould often in church-time be like a dazed man,--forget to stand up\nand sit down, turn right round and stare vacantly at the\ncongregation.  'But I mind ya daay perticler, when he and Hartley and\nI cam oot o' t' church tagedder.  I said, \"What did you think of the\nsermon, Mr. Wudsworth?\" and he answered me, \"Oh, it was verra good,\nand verra plain\"; and I said, \"Saame here, Mr. Wudsworth\"; and li'le\nHartley put his heÃ«ad o' ya side, and squeaked out, \"Oh, did ye think\nit was good? well, well, I was in purgatory the whole time.\"\n\nThe stars were overhead as we left all that was left--and that was\nlittle enough--of our cosy evening meal; and, bidding good-night, I\nwent home, with more Wordsworth memories to keep me company.\n\n{37}\n\nIt was by happy accident that I was enabled to have a chat with one\nof the best types of our half-farmer, half hotel-keeper, only a few\ndays before he left the Rydal neighbourhood for good, after a sojourn\nof sixty-five years therein.  We met at the house of a friend where\nhe had been to pay his last rent due, and as I entered the room I was\nconscious of a be-whiskied conversationally aromatic air that boded\nwell for a reet doon good crack.\n\n'Kna Wudsworth!  I sud kna him, if any man sud, for as a lad I\ncarried t' butter to t' Mount, as a grawin' man I lived and worked in\nseet on him, and I lig noo upon t' verra bed-stocks as he and his\nmissus ligged on when they were first wed, and went to Town End\ntheereaway.'\n\n'Now tell me,' said I, 'what was the poet like in face and make?'\n\n'Well in mak he was listyish.  I dar say I cud gee him four inches,\nnow I suddent wonder but what I could, mysen.'  My informant stood\nabout six feet four, or four and a half.  'He was much to leuk at\nlike his son William; he was a listy man was his son, mind ye.  But\nfor a' he was a sizeable man, was t' fadder, he was plainish\nfeatured, {38} and was a man as hed nea pleasure in his faace.  Quite\ndifferent Wudsworth was fra li'le Hartley.  Hartley allus hed a bit\nof smile or a twinkle in his faace, but Wudsworth was not loveable i'\nt' faace by nea means, for o' he was sizeable man, mind ye.'\n\n'But,' I interrupted, 'was he not much like your friend John Rigg in\nface?'\n\n'He med be t' seame mak, ye kna, much aboot; but, John Rigg hes a bit\npleasant in his faace at wust o' times, and Wudsworth, bless ye,\nnever had noan.'\n\n'Was he,' I said, 'a sociable man, Mr. Wordsworth, in the earliest\ntimes you can remember?'\n\n'Wudsworth,' my kindly giant replied, 'for a' he hed nea pride nor\nnowt, was a man who was quite one to hissel, ye kna.  He was not a\nman as fwoaks could crack wi', nor not a man as could crack wi'\nfwoaks.  But thear was anudder thing as kep' fwoaks off, he hed a\nterr'ble girt deep voice, and ye med see his faace agaan for lang\neneuf.  I've knoan folks, village lads and lasses, coming ower by t'\nauld road aboon what runs fra Gersmer to Rydal, flayt a'most to death\nthere by t' Wishing Gate to hear t' girt voice a groanin' and\nmutterin' and thunderin' {39} of a still evening.  And he hed a way\nof standin' quite still by t' rock there in t' path under Rydal, and\nfwoaks could hear sounds like a wild beast coming fra t' rocks, and\nchilder were scared fit to be dead a'most.'\n\n'He was a great walker, I know,' I broke in.  'Which were his\nfavourite roads? and was he generally on the hills, or did he keep\npretty much to the valleys?'\n\n'He was a gey good walker, an' for a' he hed latterly a pony and\nphaeton, I newer yance seed him in a conveyance in t' whole o' my\ntime.  But he was niver a mountain man.  He wad gae a deal by\nPelter-bridge and round by Red Bank, but he was maist terr'ble fond\no' under t' Nab, and by t' auld high road to t' Swan Inn and back,\nand verra often came as far as Dungeon Ghyll.  You've happen heerd\ntell o' Dungeon Ghyll; it was a verra favourite spot o' Wudsworth's,\nnoo, was that, and he yance med some potry aboot a lamb as fell ower.\nAnd I dar say it was true eneuf a' but t' rhymes, and ye kna they war\nput in to help it oot.'\n\nFor the life of me, as he spoke, I didn't understand whether he meant\nthat the rhymes fished the lamb out of the Dungeon Ghyll pool, {40}\nor helped the poet out with his verses, but I suppressed a smile and\nlistened attentively.\n\n'But for a' he was a distant man, they war weel spoken on, mind ye,\nat the Mount,' continued my voluble friend.  'They stood high, and he\nwas a man as paid his way and settled verra reglar; not that his\npotry brought him in much, a deal wasn't made up in beuks till efter\nhe was dead.  Ay, and they lived weel.  Many's the time, when I was a\nlad, and I went wid butter, I could ha' been weel content to be let\naloan for a bit i' t' pantry.  'Ticing things there, mind ye.  And\nthey kep' three sarvants.  I kent t' cook and t' housemaid weel, and\nyan they called Dixon, smart lile chap as iver was seen in these\nparts, but ter'ble given over to cauld watter and temperance--he woz.\nCoomed out of a \"union,\" but verra neat, and always a word for\nonybody, and a verra quiet man, particlar quiet, nivver up to nea\nmischief, and always sat at heam wi' t' lasses a mending and sewing\no' evenings, ye kna.'\n\nI didn't know, but guessed at once the sort of simple stay-at-home\nways and happy-family style of quiet domestic service, known to the\ncircle of maidens, who, after their day's work, {41} sat with their\nneedles and thread entertaining the guileless Dixon.\n\n'And what is your memory of Mrs. Wordsworth?'\n\n'Well, every Jack mun have his Jen, as t' saying is, and they was\nmuch of a mak.  She was a stiff little lady, nowt verra pleasant in\nher countenance neyther.'  I soon found out that the word unpleasant\nwas being used in a double sense, and was intended to convey rather\nan over-seriousness of expression perhaps than any disagreeable look\nor ill-tempered face.  'Ye're weel awar',' continued the former\nhostel-keeper, 'that we mun a' hev troubles, times is not a' alike\nwi' t' best on us; we hev our worrits and our pets, but efter yan on\n'em, yan's countenance comes agean, and Wudsworth's didn't, nor noan\no' t' family's, as I ivver seed.'\n\n'Did you ever see Mr. Wordsworth out walking--round Pelter-bridge\nway?'\n\n'Ay, ay, scores and scores o' times.  But he was a lonely man, fond\no' goin' out wi' his family, and saying nowt to noan of 'em.  When a\nman goes in a family way he keeps together wi' 'em and chats a bit\nwi' 'em, but many's a time I've seed him a takkin' his family out in\na string, and niver geein' the {42} deariest bit of notice to 'em;\nstandin' by hissel' and stoppin' behint agapin', wi' his jaws warkin'\nthe whoal time; but niver no cracking wi' 'em, nor no pleasure in\n'em,--a desolate-minded man, ye kna.  Queer thing that, mun, but it\nwas his hobby, ye kna.  It was potry as did it.  We all hev our\nhobbies--somes for huntin', some cardin', some fishin', some\nwrustlin'.  He never followed nowt nobbut a bit o' skating, happen.\nEh, he was fond of going on in danger times;--he was always furst on\nt' Rydal howiver; but his hobby, ye mun kna, was potry.  It was a\nqueer thing, but it would like eneuf cause him to be desolate; and\nI'se often thowt that his brain was that fu' of sic stuff, that he\nwas forced to be always at it whether or no, wet or fair, mumbling to\nhissel' along t' roads.'\n\n'Do you think,' I asked, 'that he had any friends among the\nshepherds?'\n\n'Naay, naay, he cared nowt about fwoak, nor sheep, nor dogs (he hed a\ngirt fine yan, weighed nine stone, to guard t' hoose) not nea mair\nthan he did aboot t' claes he hed on--his hobby was potry.'\n\n'How did he generally dress?'\n\n'Well, in my time them swallow-lappeted yans was in vogue, but he\nkep' to all-round {43} plain stuff, and I mind hed a cap wi' a neb\ntull it.  He wore that maist days.'\n\n'Did you ever read his poetry, or see any books about it in the\nfarm-houses?' I asked.\n\n'Ay, ay, time or two.  But ya're weel aware there's potry and potry.\nThere's potry wi' a li'le bit pleasant in it, and potry sec as a man\ncan laugh at or t' childer understand, and some as taks a deal o'\nmastery to mak' oot what's said, and a deal of Wudsworth's was this\nsort, ye kna.  You cud tell fra t' man's faace his potry wad nivver\nhev nea laugh in it.\n\n'His potry was quite different wark frae li'le Hartley.  Hartley wad\ngang runnin' beside o' t' becks and mak his, and gang in t' furst\nopen deur and write what he hed gittin' on t' paper.  But Wudsworth's\npotry was real hard stuff, and bided a deal of makkin', and he'd keep\nit in his head for lang eneuf.  Eh, but it's queer, mon, different\nways fwoaks hes of makkin' potry now.  Fowks gaes a deal to see whar\nhe's interred; but for my part I'd walk twice distance ower t' Fells\nto see whar Hartley lies.  Not bit what Mr. Wudsworth didn't stand\nverra high, and was a weel-spoken man eneuf, but quite yan to hissel.\nWell, well, good-day.'  And so we {44} rose to go; he to his farm, I\nto my note-book.\n\n\nI pass over sundry interviews of minor import, and will detail as\naccurately as I can the result of several conversations with one who\nas a boy lived as page, or butler's assistant, at Rydal Mount, and\nnow himself in total eclipse (for he is blind) delights to handle and\nshow with pride the massy, old-fashioned square glazed hand-lantern,\nthat lighted his master the poet on his favourite evening walks.\n\nWe go through Ambleside to reach his house, and call for a moment at\nthe shop of a man for whom on his wedding-day Hartley Coleridge wrote\nthe touching sonnet in which he describes himself as\n\n  Untimely old, irreverendly grey,\n\nand he will tell us that Mr. Wordsworth was not a man of very\noutgoing ways with folk, a plain man, a very austere man, and one who\nwas ponderous in his speech.  That he called very often at his shop,\nand would talk, 'but not about much,' just passing the day.  He will\ntell us that Mrs. Wordsworth was a very plain-faced lady, but will\nadd that, 'for {45} aw that, Mr. Wordsworth and she were very fond of\none another.'\n\nThere is, as one would expect, a sort of general feeling among the\ndalesmen that it was rather a strange thing that two people so\naustere and uncomely in mere line of feature or figure should be so\nmuch in love, and so gentle and considerate in their lives.  I say as\nwe should expect, for the men of Lakeland and the women of Lakeland\nare notably comely, their features notably regular.  I do not myself\nknow of a single instance of a really ugly married woman among the\npeasants that I have met with in Westmoreland.  But at the same time\nwe must remember that the word 'plain,' whether applied to dress or\nfeature, in Westmoreland, means for the most part simple, homely,\nunpretending, unassuming, and is often a term of honour rather than\ndispraise.\n\nWe shall, perhaps, as we near the village where our blind friend\nlives, meet with an old man who will tell us that he helped to bear\nboth the poet and his wife to the grave, but he will add that he was\nnot 'over weel acquent wi' 'em, though he knas the room they both\ndied in,' and that the time he saw most of the poet was the occasion\n{46} when he conducted Queen Adelaide 'to see the Rydal Falls, and\nall about.'\n\n\nWe have got to the end of our walk, and here, picking his way by\nmeans of his trusty sounding-staff backwards and forwards in the\nsunshine he feels, but cannot see, is the old man, or rather old\ngentleman who in former times 'took sarvice along of Mr. Wudsworth,'\nand was 'so well pleased with his master that he could verra weel hev\nended his days at t' Mount,' but found it was over quiet, and,\nwanting to see the world beyond the charmed circle of the hills, left\na good place, but not before he had formed his opinion of both master\nand mistress, and obtained indelible impressions of their several\npersonalities, and had conceived along with these an affection for\nthem which glows in his words as he talks to us of them.  'Mr.\nWudsworth was a plaain-feaced man, and a mean liver.'  The\ndescription, as I hinted in the preface, would have staggered a\nphilo-Wordsworthian unaccustomed to the native dialect.  'But he was\na good master and kind man; and as for Mrs. Wudsworth, she was a\ndownright cliver woman, as kep' accounts, and was a reg'lar manasher.\nHe {47} never know'd, bless ye, what he hed, nor what he was wuth,\nnor whether there was owt to eat in t' house, nivver.'\n\n'But you say,' I interposed, 'that he didn't care much whether there\nwas or was not food in the house.'\n\n'Nay, nay, Wudsworth was a man as was fond of a good dinner at times,\nif you could get him to it, that was t' job; not but what he was a\nvery temperate man i' all things, vara, but they was all on 'em mean\nlivers, and in a plain way.  It was poddish for t' breakfast, and a\nbit o' mutton to t' dinner, and poddish at night, with a bit of\ncheese happen to end up wi'.'\n\n'You said it was hard to get him to his meals: what did you mean?' I\nasked.\n\n'Weel, weel, it was study as was his delight: he was aw for study;\nand Mrs. Wudsworth would say, \"Ring the bell,\" but he wouldn't stir,\nbless ye.  \"Goa and see what he's doing,\" she'd say, and we wad goa\nup to study door and hear him a mumbling and bumming through it.\n\"Dinner's ready, sir,\" I'd ca' out, but he'd goa mumbling on like a\ndeaf man, ya see.  And sometimes Mrs. Wudsworth 'ud say, \"Goa and\nbrek a bottle, or let a dish fall just outside door {48} in passage.\"\nEh dear, that maistly wad bring him out, wad that.  It was nobbut\nthat as wad, howivver.  For ye kna he was a verra careful man, and he\ncouldn't do with brekking t' china.'\n\n'And was he continually at study in-doors, or did he rise early, go\nout for a walk before breakfast, and study, as I have heard, mostly\nin the open air?' I asked.\n\nMy friend answered at once.  'He was always at it, ye kna, but it was\nnowt but what he liked, and not much desk-wark except when he had a\nmind tul it.  Noa, noa, he was quite a open-air man was Wudsworth:\nstudied a deal aboot t' roads.  He wasn't particlar fond of gitten up\nearly, but did a deal of study efter breakfast, and a deal efter tea.\nWalked t' roads efter dark, he wad, a deal, between his tea and\nsupper, and efter.  Not a verra conversable man, a mumblin' and\nstoppin', and seein' nowt nor neabody.'\n\n[Illustration: DOROTHY WORDSWORTH.]\n\n'And what were his favourite roads?' I asked, in an innocent way.\n\n'Well, he was verra partial to ganging up to Tarn Foot in Easedale,\nand was fondest o' walking by Red Bank and round by Barber's (the\nlate Miss Agar's house), or else {49} t'other way about and home by\nClappersgate and Brankers, under Loughrigg.  Never was nowt of a\nmountaineer, and Miss Dorothy 'companied him.  Eh dear, many time\nI've watched him coming round wi' t' lantern and her efter a walk by\nnight.  You've heard tell of Miss Dorothy, happen.  Well, fwoaks said\nshe was cliverest mon of the two at his job, and he allays went to\nher when he was puzzelt.  Dorothy hed t' wits, tho' she went wrang,\nye kna.'\n\n'Then,' said I, 'Mrs. Wordsworth did not help the poet in writing his\nverses?'\n\n'Naay, naay.  Why, she was a manasher, niver a studier, but for a'\nthat there's nea doot he and she was truly companionable, and they\nwer terr'ble fond o' yan anudder.  But Dorothy hed t' wits on 'em\nboath.'\n\n'And he was very devoted to his children,' I put in.\n\n'Ay, ay, he was fond of children like eneuf, but children was nivver\nverra fond o' him.  Ye see he was a man 'o moods, nivver nea\ncertainty aboot him; and I'se not sea sure he was fond of other\nfowk's bairns, but he was verra fond o' his ain wi'out a doot.'\n\n'And was he very popular among the folk hereabouts?'\n\n{50}\n\n'There's nea doot but what he was fond of quality, and quality was\nvery fond o' him, but he niver exed fowk aboot their wark, nor\nnoticed t' flocks nor nowt: not but what he was a kind man if fwoaks\nwas sick and taen badly.  But farming, nor beast, nor sheep, nor\nfields wasn't in his way, he exed nea questions about flocks or\nherds, and was a distant man, not what you might call an outward man\nby noa means.  And he was verra close, verra close indeed, fra\ncurious men.  He'd gang t' other side o' t' road rather than pass a\nman as exed questions a deal.'\n\nIt was a mercy, I thought to myself, that no Wordsworth Society had\ninvited me to collect and write down the results of a cross-question\ntour in those days.\n\n'But surely,' I said, 'he had some particular cottage or farm where\nhe would go and have a crack.'\n\n'Naay, naay.  He would go times or two to farm Dungeon Ghyll way, but\nhe wasn't a man for friends.  He had some, neah doubt, in his walk of\nlife; he was ter'ble friends with the Doctor (Arnold) and Muster\nSouthey, and Wilson of Elleray and Hartley Coleridge.  I'se seen him\nmany a time takkin' him out arm i' arm for a talking.  But he {51}\nwas specially friendly with Professor.  I mind one time when we was\ndriving, me and Mrs. Wudsworth and Miss Wudsworth, to Kendal, and\nProfessor Wilson was superintending making o' a bye road up by\nElleray there, and he was in his slippers.  Nowt wud do but Wudsworth\nmust git down and fall to talkin', and we went on; but he didn't\ncome, and Mrs. Wudsworth said, 'Ye mun drive on; he'll pick us up at\nKendal: no knowing what's got him now Professor is wi' 'im.'  Well,\nwell, she was right.  For after putting up at Kendal, who should walk\nin but Wudsworth and Professor wi'out any shoes to his feet neather,\nfor Wilson was in his slippers, and 'ad walk'd hissel' to his\nstockin' feet, and left his stockin' on t' road an aw' far eneuf\nbefore they got to Kendal.'\n\n'But it was strange,' I said again in a suggestive way, 'that Mr.\nWordsworth should be so well \"acquaint\" with Professor Wilson, for he\nwas a great cock-fighting and wrestling man, was he not, in his day?'\n\n'Ay, ay, biggest hereaboot,' my old friend replied.  'It's queer, but\nit was along o' his study, ye kna.  Wudsworth was nivver nea\ncock-fyhter nor wrestler, no gaming man at all, and not a hunter, and\nas for fishing {52} he hedn't a bit o' fish in him, hedn't\nWudsworth--not a bit of fish in him.'\n\n'I have read in his books,' said I, 'things that make me feel he was\nkind to dumb animals.'\n\n'Naay, naay,' my friend broke in, 'Wrudsworth was nea dog fancier;\nand as for cats, he couldn't abide them; and he didn't care for\nsheep, or horses, a deal, but if he was fond of owt, it was of t'\n_li'le ponies_.  He was a man of fancies, ye kna.  It was a fancy of\nhis.  He was fond of li'le ponies, nivver rode a horse in his life,\nnivver.'\n\n'But he went over a deal of ground in his time.  Was he always on his\nfeet?' I said.\n\n'He went ower a deal mair ground nor ever he saw, for he went a deal\nby night, but he was a man as took notice, ye kna, nivver forgat what\nhe saw, and he went slow.'\n\n'But,' said I, 'how did he cover so much ground; was he never on\nwheels?'\n\n'Ay, ay, wheels, to be sure, he druv a' times, ye kna, in t' cart.\nHe, and Mrs. Wudsworth, and Dorothy and me, we went a deal by cart\nPenrith way, and Borradale and Keswick way, and Langdale way at\ntimes.'\n\n'What sort of a cart?' I inquired.\n\n{53}\n\n'Dung cart, to be sure.  Just a dung cart, wi' a seat-board in t'\nfront, and bit of bracken in t' bottom, comfortable as owt.  We cud\nga that way for days, and far eneuf.  Ye kna in them days tubs wasn't\nknown.  Low-wood was nobbut a cottage, and there was never abuv six\nor seven ponies for hiring at Ambleside.  Tubs we ca' t' covered\ncarriages, tubs wasn't known in these parts.  But happen there was a\ntub or two at Kendal.'\n\n'And you must have gone precious slowly,' I said.\n\n'Ay, ay, slow eneuf, but that was Mr. Wudsworth's fancy, and he'd git\nin and go along, and then he git down into t' road and walk a bit,\nand mak a bit, and then he git oop and hum a bit to himsel, and then\nhe'd stop and hev a leuk here and there for a while.  He was a man as\nnoticed a deal o' steans and trees, verra particler aboot t' trees,\nor a rock wi' ony character in it.  When they cut down coppy woods in\nthese parts they maistly left a bit of t' coppy just behint wall to\nhide it for him, he was a girt judge in sic things, and noticed a\ndeal.'\n\n'And would he,' I asked, 'tell you as you jogged along in the cart,\nwhich mountain {54} he was fondest off, or bid you look at the\nsunset?'\n\n'Ay, ay, times he would say, \"Now isn't that beautiful?\" and times he\nwould hum on to himself.  But he wasn't a man as would give a\njudgment agean ony mountain.  I've heard girt folks 'at com to t'\nMount say, \"Now, Mr. Wudsworth, we want to see finest mountain in t'\ncountry,\" and he would say, \"Ivery mountain is finest.\"  Ay, that's\nwhat he would say.'\n\n'But I have been told that his voice was very deep,' I put in, in a\nhappy-go-lucky way.  'Had he a loud laugh now?'\n\n'I don't mind he iver laughed in his life, he'd smile times or two.\nAy, ay, his voice was deep one; bit I mind at t' family prayers in t'\nmorning he'd read a bit o' _the_ Scripture to us, and he was a verra\narticulate, particlar good reader, was Mr. Wudsworth, always hed\nfamily prayer in the morning, and went to church wi' prayer-book\nunder his arm, verra regular yance upon the Sunday, he did.'  My\nfriend added, 'He was quite a serious-minded man, and a man of moods.'\n\nHere ended my talk with the old retainer at the Mount.  But I was not\nallowed to go {55} off until I had seen and handled the old-fashioned\ncandle lattern by which, as my kind informant put it, the poet 'did a\ndeal of his study aboot t' roads efter dark.'\n\nAnd so must end my plain unvarnished tale.  I leave my indulgent\nreaders to form their own conclusions; merely suggesting that the\ncollected evidence points to a simple plainness and homeliness of\nlife such as remains indelibly impressed upon the men of\nWestmoreland, whose own lives are less simple in these latter days,\nwhen ostentation and vulgar pride of wealth in a class above them\nhave climbed the hills and possessed the valleys.\n\nThe testimony of the witnesses I have been fortunate enough to bring\nbefore you seems to agree in depicting Wordsworth as he painted\nhimself, a plain man, continually murmuring his undersong as he\npassed along by brook and woodland, pacing the ground with unuplifted\neye, but so retired, that even the North country peasant, who does\neven yet recognise the social differences of class and caste that\nseparate and divide 'the unknown little from the unknowing great,'\nwas unable to feel at home with him.  'Not a very companionable man\nat the best of times' was their verdict.  But I think all the while\n{56} these dalesmen seem to have felt that if the poet was not of\nmuch count as a worldly-wise farm or shepherd authority, nor very\nconvivial and free and easy as li'le Hartley was, nor very athletic\nand hearty as Professor Wilson, there was a something in the\nsevere-faced, simply habited man 'as said nowt to neabody' that made\nhim head and shoulders above the people, and bade them listen and\nremember when he spoke, if it was only on the lopping of a tree or\nthe building of a chimney-stack.  'He was a man of a very practical\neye, and seemed to see everything,' was the feeling.\n\nAnd turning from the poet to his wife, whilst one can see how the\nhousehold need of economy in early Town End days gave her to the last\nthe practical power of household management that had almost passed\ninto a proverb, one can see also how true was that picture of the\n\n  Being breathing thoughtful breath,\n  * * * * *\n  A perfect woman, nobly planned,\n  To warn, to comfort, and command.\n\n\n'He never knawed, they say, what he was wuth, nor what he hed i' t'\nhouse.'  She did it all.  Then, too, it is touching to {57} notice\nhow deep and true the constant love between man and wife was seen to\nbe, how truly companions for life they were, and that, too, in the\neyes of a class of people who never saw that\n\n  Beauty born of murmuring sound\n  Had passed into her face,\n\nand half marvelled that the spirit wed with spirit was so\nmarvellously closer than fleshly bond to flesh.\n\nUpright, the soul of honour, and for that reason standing high with\nall; just to their servants; well meaning and quiet in their public\nlife; full of affection in their simple home life; so it seems the\npoet and his wife lived and died.  Thought a deal of for the fact\nthat accounts were strictly met at the tradesmen's shops, they were\nthought more of because they were ever ready to hear the cry of the\nsuffering, and to enter the doors of those ready to perish.\n\nI do not think I have been able to tell the world anything new about\nthe poet or his surroundings.  But the man 'who hedn't a bit of fish\nin him, and was no mountaineer,' seems to have been in the eyes of\nthe people always at his studies; 'and that because he couldn't help\nit, because it was his hobby,' {58} for sheer love, and not for\nmoney.  This astonished the industrious money-loving folk, who could\nnot understand the doing work for 'nowt,' and perhaps held the poet's\noccupation in somewhat lighter esteem, just because it did not bring\nin 'a deal o' brass to the pocket.'  I think it is very interesting,\nhowever, to notice how the woman part of the Rydal Mount family\nseemed to the simple neighbourhood to have the talent and mental\nability; and there must have been, both about Dorothy Wordsworth and\nthe poet's daughter Dora, a quite remarkable power of inspiring the\nminds of the poor with whom they came in contact, with a belief in\ntheir intellectual faculties and brightness and cleverness.  If\nHartley Coleridge was held by some to be Wordsworth's helper, it was\nto Dorothy he was supposed by all to turn if 'ivver he was puzzelt.'\nThe women had 'the wits, or best part of 'em,'--this was proverbial\namong the peasantry, and, as having been an article of rural faith,\nit has been established out of the mouths of all the witnesses it has\nbeen my lot to call.\n\n\n\n\n{59}\n\nWITH THE BLACK-HEADED GULLS IN CUMBERLAND.\n\nThere is no part of the Cumberland coast so full of witchery and\nromance as the point where Muncaster Fell comes down to the sea.  The\nrivers of Irt, Mite and Esk, with their memories of the\npearl-fisheries of olden time, swirl down toward the ancient harbour\nof the mythic 'King Aveling's Town.'  One cannot look across the pool\nat full tide without thought of how the Vikings pushed their ships\nashore here, when they came from Mona's Isle to harry Cumberland.\n\nBut the sound of earlier civilisations is in our ears as one gazes\nacross the Ravenglass sand-dunes; for here beside us is the great\ncavern of ancient oaken-logs and earth, wherein the Cymri buried\ntheir dead in prehistoric time, and there within a stone's throw\nstill upstands the seaside residence of some great Roman {60}\ngeneral, who was determined apparently to enjoy a well-heated house,\nand to do honour to the _genius loci_.  No one who visits 'Walls'\nCastle, as it is called, but must be struck with the remains of the\n'tepidarium,' and the little niche that held the statue of the\ntutelary god, or a bust of the presiding CÃ¦sar, within the ample hall.\n\nAway at our back rises the Muncaster Fell with its grey beacon-tower,\nits herd of deer, its wind-blown oaks, its primrose and bluebell\nhaunted woods, that slope towards the Vale of Esk.  Further inland,\nsheltered by its magnificent wall of forestry, stands rose-red one of\nthe most interesting of our northern castles, with its long\nterrace-lawn of quite unequalled grace and loveliness.  There in\nsheltered combe the rhododendrons bloom from earliest spring, and the\nair will to-day be honeysweet from laurel-flower far and wide.\n\nBut I was bent on seeing an older people than Cymri, Roman, Viking,\nor Castle-Lord, albeit the line of Pennington reached far into the\npast, and suited well his ancient castle hold.  I had come in the\nlast week of April, by courteous invitation, to renew acquaintance\nwith that fast-growing colony of black-headed gulls that make the\ndunes of Ravenglass famous.\n\n{61}\n\nA boat was called, and leaving the pebbly beach that 'Stott of\nOldham' so delights to paint, we rowed across the flooding tide of\nthe Ravenglass harbour to the sand-dunes of happy quietude, where the\noyster-catchers were sunning themselves, and where the sheldrake in\nher nesting season loves to hide.  As one went forward over the dunes\none felt back in the great desert of the Badiet-Tih, and expected to\nsee Bedouins start from the ground, and camels come in single file\nwith solemn sway round the sedge-tufted, wind-blown hillocks and\nhummocks of glaring sand.\n\nThen suddenly the silence of the waste was broken by a marvellous\nsound, and a huge cloud of palpitating wings, that changed from black\nto white and hovered and trembled against the grey sea or the blue\ninland hills, swept by over-head.  The black-headed gulls had heard\nof our approach, and mightily disapproved of our trespass upon their\nsand-blown solitude.\n\nWe sat down and the clamour died: the gulls had settled.  Creeping\nwarily to the crest of a great billow of sand, we peeped beyond.\nBelow us lay a natural amphitheatre of grey-green grass that looked\nas if it were starred with white flowers innumerable.  We showed our\nheads and the flowers all took wing, and the air was {62} filled\nagain with sound and intricate maze of innumerable wings.\n\nWe approached, and walking with care found the ground cup-marked with\nlittle baskets or basket-bottoms roughly woven of tussock grass or\nsea-bent.  Each casket contained from two to three magnificent\njewels.  These were the eggs we had come so far to see.  There they\nlay--deep brown blotched with purple, light bronze marked with brown,\npale green dashed with umber, white shading into blue.  All colours\nand all sizes; some as small as a pigeon's, others as large as a\nbantam's.  Three seemed to be the general complement.  In one nest I\nfound four.  The nests were so close to one another that I counted\ntwenty-six within a radius of ten yards; and what struck one most was\nthe way in which, instead of seeking shelter, the birds had evidently\nplanned to nest on every bit of rising ground from which swift\noutlook over the gull-nursery could be obtained.\n\nWho shall describe the uproar and anger with which one was greeted as\none stood in the midst of the nests?  The black-headed gull swept at\none with open beak, and one found oneself involuntarily shading one's\nface and protecting one's eyes as the savage little sooty-brown heads\nswooped round one's head.  But {63} we were not the only foes they\nhad had to battle with.  The carrion crow had evidently been an\nintruder and a thief; and many an egg which was beginning to be hard\nset on, had been prey to the black robber's beak.  One was being\nrobbed as I stood there in the midst of the hubbub.\n\nAway, for what seemed the best part of a mile, the 'gullery'\nstretched to the north in the direction of Seascale; and one felt\nthat, thanks to the public-spirited owner of the seaboard, and the\nCounty Council of Cumberland, the black-headed gull was not likely to\ndiminish in this generation.\n\nBack to the boat we went with a feeling that we owed large apologies\nto the whole sea-gull race for giving this colony such alarm, and\ncausing such apparent disquietude of heart, and large thanks to the\nlord of Muncaster for his ceaseless care of the wild sea-people whom\neach year he entertains upon his golden dunes.\n\nThat evening I went back in memory to the marvellous sight in the\nGullery at Ravenglass.  My thoughts took sonnet form as follows:\n\n  THE HOPE OF LIFE.\n\n  Sudden the lilies of each lonely mound\n    Sprang into voice and palpitating wing;\n    I seemed a guilty and unwelcome thing;\n  {64}\n  Ten thousand shadows round me and around\n  Perplexed the air and danced along the ground;\n    Each sooty head, in passion, dared to fling\n    A world's defiance--and I felt the sting\n  And arrows of that deprecating sound.\n\n  Then gazing downward at my feet I saw\n    The silent cause of all these sorrowful cries,\n    --Large jewels, blotched and brown and green and blue,\n  In simple caskets wove from rushy straw;\n      I thanked high Heaven for hearts so good and true,\n    And shared their hope for life that never dies.\n\n\nThey are a far-wandering nation these black-headed gulls.  I had seen\nseparate members of the tribe on the banks of the Neva, and later, on\nthe banks of the Nile; for they are an adventurous race, and may be\nfound as far north as Archangel and as far south as Nubia, but the\nnext time that I saw them in any number they had changed not only\ntheir appearance but their manners.  The black or, more properly\nspeaking, brown head of the gull had become grey.  It seems they only\nwear their black helmets or bonnets in summer time.  Now it was\nwinter, and they were as mild as doves--tamer birds could hardly be\nseen, and the history of their taming, as indeed of their presence so\nfar inland as the Keswick valley, was very simple.  There had been a\nvery cruel wholesale {65} poisoning of the fish in the river\nGreta--the black-headed gulls had heard of it, and came up the\nDerwent in great numbers to the feast.  It cannot have been all\npleasure, and to judge by the looks of some of the greedier of the\nclass colic abounded.  Whether it was the abundance of the feast or\nthe after pain, that made an impression on the gull, I know not, but\nfrom that day to this the black-headed gentry of the seaboard have\nhad such affection for our vale that any storm at sea or any scarcity\nof food brings them in great numbers to our valley pastures.\n\nWe had a hard winter three years ago, and wherever the rooks were\nseen upon the ground, the black flock was dappled with the white sea\ngull, and the dolorous voice of the crow was drowned in the laughter\nof the black-headed gull.\n\nVery grateful were we in those sad and sombre winter mornings to hear\nthe gulls laughing round our house-roofs, and not the least enjoyable\nthought as we went to our breakfast-table was the knowledge that\nthese wild sea-people had come to trust us, and were willing to be\nour almoners.\n\nThere was one house in the valley, set upon a grassy hill overlooking\nthe lake, which {66} seemed especially to have charm for the bird\nvisitors.  Swift of ear, as of eye, the black-headed gulls noticed\nthat the family went to breakfast at the sound of a gong.  No sooner\ndid that gong echo across the lawn, than the heaven became white with\nwings--a click at the gate was heard, and a maid with a large\npancheon of food specially prepared--hot and tasty--was seen to come\non to the grass and toss out the meal, in splotches, round about her.\nThen what had been a silent grey undulating cloud of wings broke up\ninto a tangled mass of down-sweeping pink legs and up-sweeping white\nwings, and with the noise of laughter and talk unimaginable, the\nhappy people fell to feeding.\n\nI do not think that anything more dainty can be imagined than that\nswift balance of up-tilted wing and down-reaching rosy feet, unless\nit be the consummate care and nicety with which, before the\nblack-headed gull put beak to food, it tucked those long sweeping\nslender wings close to its side.\n\nNow and again as they fed, the whole flock would rise momentarily\ninto air and float up as though blown from the earth by some\ninvisible breath, and then, as silently and simultaneously, sink to\nearth again.\n\n{67}\n\nAt times one noticed how, rising up, they seemed to move in exactly\none position, moving their yellow rosy-stained beaks and grey heads\nfrom right to left as though they feared an enemy.  Yet they had no\nneed to fear, for it was quite clear that the rooks had been\nspecially engaged by them to be their sentinels.  There they sat each\nin solitary sable-hood, on the trees all round the lawn,--policemen\non guard, and of such good manners, that until the visitors from the\nsea had eaten and were full, they did not think of claiming their\nshare of the broken victual.\n\nWhat astonished one most as these black-headed gulls came morning\nafter morning to the sound of the gong, was their apparent\ndetermination to lose no time about their food.  They sat down to\ntable and rose up as one bird, but they were not more than ten\nminutes about their meal, and there was some reason for this.  There\nwere other breakfast tables spread for them on other lawns; the gong\nat Derwent Hill was after all but summons to a first course.\n\nHow mild, how gentle, with what dove-like tenderness did these\ngrey-headed people of the sea appear as with merry laughter they\nsailed about my head, their feet tucked {68} up like coral pink\njewels against their breast; how unlike those fierce black-headed\nguardians of their nests and young, who had dashed at one, with open\nbeak and scolding voice and angry wing, upon the spring-tide dunes of\nRavenglass.\n\n\n\n\n{69}\n\nAT THE GRASMERE PLAY.\n\nWhat a wonderful people these Westmoreland folk are; we see them on\nthe Wrestling Ground at Pavement end, and we think we never saw such\n'playing.'  We enter a Westmoreland dale farm, and we feel, if ever\nmen and women were born to make two ends meet by the care of sheep or\ncattle, these are the people.  We take lodgings in a Westmoreland\nvillage for a holiday season, and though it may be quite true that\nthe landlady doesn't rave about the scenery, and is rather of the\ntype of the good woman-body who had lived at Rydal Mount before she\nbecame lodging-house keeper, and who said to my friend, 'Yes, yes, I\nam a tidy good cook and a decentish housekeeper, but I don't know\nnowt about sunsets or sic like, and I don't need, they've never been\nin my line,' it is at the same time true that, for looking after\none's creature wants and entering into the doings {70} of every day\nand making one feel part and parcel of the household, a Westmorland\nhousekeeper is bad to beat.\n\nBut though I thought I knew the capacity of Westmoreland folk pretty\nwell, a new surprise was in store for me as I took my seat in the\ntemporary play-house at Grasmere and learned that Westmoreland folk\ncan not only play in the Grasmere wrestling ring, but can play on the\nboards and before the footlights also.  It is quite true that the\nGrasmere people have had nearly a generation of training in the\ndramatic art.  A late rector, who was much interested in looking\nafter the recreations of the village, had translated for them many a\nsimple pastoral play from the French, and hardly a Christmas came\nround, but he and his family, one of whom was herself a talented\nwriter of country plays, trained the villagers to give their\nneighbours a play, and the children in the Bands of Hope to act\ncharades.  Since his time another family who are much honoured at\nGrasmere, and who have the same kind of enthusiasm for the dramatic\ncapacity of the village, had carried on the work, with the result\nthat at a moment's notice, for any simple play the daughter of the\nhouse might write or adapt, she could count on having as her players\nseventeen or eighteen of the {71} villagers who would seem born for\nthe parts she entrusted to them.  There was no rivalry, no\n'fratching' from house to house because this person or that person\nwas not selected for this or that particular part; on the contrary,\nthe village had such confidence in the conductor of the village\n_troupe_ that if Miss S. thought that So-and-so was to take this part\nand So-and-so the other, that was enough, and not another word was to\nbe said.  Meanwhile the village had come to look upon the village\nplay as part of its very life and soul.  Grasmere in winter time\nwould not be recognised by the average tourist.  It is a village of\npeace absolute and tranquillity beyond words.\n\nFrom the earliest times 'Cursmas' has been looked upon as a time when\neverybody in the dale should enjoy himself.  In the old days, when\nthe fiddlers went round from farm to farm between Christmas-day and\nNew Year's Day, and when the Merry Night (or Murry Neet) was held\nfrom place to place, the Grasmere folk knew that, however hard they\nworked for the rest of the year, at least they would 'laike' until\nthe Twelfth Night, and precious little work would go forward in the\ndales for the first fortnight of each glad new year.  The desire for\nsome simple and rational form of {72} amusement with the beginning of\nevery year has never died out of their blood, so that a village play\nseems to fill a need which is part of their very nature.  'Why, we\ncould not live without it,' said a Grasmere body to me; 'it's the\nbrightest spot in our lives.'  'I can't tell you how dramatic it\nmakes me feel,' said another.  'I am going thro' my dialogue at all\ntimes o' day.'  My husband said, 'You've had company to-day then.'\n'Ay, ay,' I replied, 'rare company.  I was taking two or three parts\nin second Act, you see, and changing voices, that was all.'\n\n'But where do you get your theatrical properties?' I said.  'Who\nmanages the scene-shifting and all the rest of it?'  'Oh, as for\nscene-shifting, that is all managed by that great hairy-faced man\nthat you saw going down the road just now; he is a grand stage\nmanager and has been at it for twenty years or more.'  I did not see\nhim again until after the close of the performance, when I noticed\nhim with his pocket-handkerchief in an unconventional way fanning out\nthe footlights, and then going up on a ladder to puff out the oil\nlamps above the stage.  'And as for properties,' the good dame\nreplied, 'if you mean by that the things we have on the stage, well\neverything is lent--there is {73} crockery from one house and chairs\nfrom another, and the dresses, why they are the old originals that\nwere worn by our grandmothers, and great-grandmothers.  We all know\nto what farm or to what house we must go for this or that particular\ndress, and it is lent very willingly.'  'And do you have large\naudiences?' I said.  'Large audiences, well, if th' room would hold\ndouble the number we could fill it, because folk of all maks and\nsizes come together.  This year we are giving a special afternoon\nperformance for the quality, but I am told that all reserved seats\nhave been booked for weeks.'\n\nIt was growing dark as I stood by the cottage door.  The omnibus, as\nit drove down from the Raise gap with folk from Keswick coming to see\nthe play, was sending sparks out behind from its 'slipper,' as though\nit were making fireworks.  And soon I saw the lamp-lighter lighting\nup the oil lamps in the quaintly intricate lanes of the village\nbeside the Mere.  Knots of people were gathered already at their\ndoor-ways talking of the play, and already folk were drawing towards\nthe village hall near the Red Lion.  I soon joined them, and passed\nup a break-neck stairway to a big barn-like room, the {74} back part\nof which was filled with rough boards knocked up into temporary\nbenches, and the forepart had wooden cottage chairs for reserved\nseats.  The drop-scene was down--the lake and island with Helm Crag\nand Dunmail Raise, as seen from Loughrigg, on a summer evening.\n\nA big moon shone in a solid sort of way in mid-heaven, and was\nrepeated at intervals right down through the picture, as though the\nscene-painters would say: 'This is the moon, it is rising now, and\nthere it is fully risen.'  But I was assured that this was the result\nof some accident by fire that had taken place years ago in the said\ndrop-scene, and that these moons were, after all, only the patches\nthat repaired the beautiful picture.  Three fiddlers and a piano were\nmaking lively music when the bell tinkled and the curtain went up.\nIt was a very simple scene--the village carpenter sitting in his shop\nworking away at a stool, but it was to the life; and the Jacob who\nwas working there, with his red handkerchief round his throat, spoke\nand acted to the life, and well he might--he was a village carpenter.\nA tourist came upon the scene, and got very little change out of\nJacob, and less still out of Jacob's mother, Mrs. Rawlinson, {75} who\n(after a very amusing dialogue with the tourist) determined to allow\nhim to be her lodger.  She made him pay double the usual price\nbecause he asked for 'sec a new faddlement as a seven o'clock\ndinner.'  Dolly, the maid, comes in with a handkerchief bound over\nher head, as is the fashion of the North-country maids when they are\ndusting or brushing up.  They fall to talk:\n\nMrs. Rawlinson: 'I'se goin' to have mair nor sebben shillings a room\nthis time, but I was forced to ask a good price, for he'll be wanting\nlate dinners, and a' maks o' cooking and faddlements.  What does ta\nthink wawmlets'll be, Dolly?'\n\nDolly: 'Nay, I never heard tell o' sec a thing.'\n\nMrs. Rawlinson: 'And grilled bones to his breakfast; but I kna' what\nthem'll be, just a marra bone served up hot in a napkin.  I can\nmannish that finely.  Then he talked about a dish o' curry; that'll\ncertainly be some mak o' a French stew, made rare and hot wid pepper\nand an onion or two.'\n\nDolly: 'What, thou's goin' to be sadly tewed.'\n\nMrs. Rawlinson: 'Nay.  I was nobbut a bit put about at first, but I\nmean to ask {76} Betty Braithwaite to lend me her beuk as larns yan\nto mak hundreds and hundreds of things 'at I never heard of, nor\nnaebody else, I wud think.'\n\nAs long as I live I shall remember the delightful get-up of this said\nMrs. Rawlinson, with her high black cap and flower in it, and her\nold-fashioned criss-cross shawl, and her spotless white 'brat'; and\nthe way in which she pronounced the word 'omelette' as 'waumlett'\nconvulsed the house.\n\nThe second scene in that first act was one that went home to the\nhearts of all, for if the Westmoreland folk love one thing more\ndearly than another it is 'a sale.'  The sale is really the\nexcitement of the winter time.  I believe that if nobody was changing\nfarms they would compel someone in the neighbourhood to pretend that\nhe was, that a sale might be held.  It is not the fierce excitement\nof bidding one against the other that causes the great gathering at\nthe sale, but 'everybody's tied to go,' as they say--bound to go to\nthe sale, just as everybody is bound to go when they are bid to a\nfuneral.  It would not be friendly not to do so, and high, low, rich\nand poor, one with another, meet at the sales, as De Quincey has\nreminded us, to see {77} one another and to hear how the world is\nstirring.\n\nThe Grasmere Players in this sale scene were all of the manner born,\nand a young mason played the part of 'Tom Mashiter' (auctioneer) with\ngreat delight to himself and to his audience.\n\n'Here's t' fadther and muther and t' dowter he cried, as he put three\nteapots together.  2s. 6d. for the lot just to get us into the\nbidding!  Here's a pair of copper scales; see how true they hang!\nNow I durst bet there's not above half a dozen among us as honest as\nthem is.  There's not, howiver; and I know who's yan o' the\nhalf-dozen; ye can settle the other five amang you.  Three an' six.\nThree an nine.  Come, be quick.  Nay, I'll not wait.  I'll tak some\non ye in, ye'll see, if ye don't bid quicker----'\n\nAnd the scales were knocked down 'mid roars of laughter.\n\n'Here's another good jar, yan o' t' auld fashion, wid a pair o' good\nlugs to hod by.  A penny for it I have bid; who'll say tuppence?\nTuppence for you, Sarah.  It's a real good un, yan o' t' rare\nauld-fashioned mak, like me an you, Sarah.  I think there's nobbut us\ntwo left o' the auld lang-eared breed.'\n\n{78}\n\nThen there were quilts sold with a deal of very amusing talk to make\nthem go off.  One was in rags and tatters, but the auctioneer\nsuggested that it might do for a sick horse or a sick cow.  I was\nlistening with great amusement, and I heard an old fellow beside me\nsay, 'Well, but things is goin' ower cheap,' and in another moment\njerked out, 'A penny--here,' and was not a little astonished that his\nbid was not taken.  I only mention this to show you how to the life\nthe whole thing was done, and with what deep interest the spectators\ngazed upon the play.\n\nIn the second act the plot thickens, and the interest centres in the\ntwo chief actors of the little play--Aaron Hartley, with his\napparently rejected addresses to the statesman's daughter up at\nHardcragg Farm, and Betty Braithwaite.  Aaron comes into his mother's\nkitchen, and, as far as any Westmoreland man dare let himself go,\nallows her to see that things are all up between himself and Betty.\nHe must go off to 'Lunnon,' for he cannot face living on in the dale\nnow, and all the hay grass but one meadow has been got in.\n\n'I think I must be going away, muther, for a bit.  I don't see but\nthat you'll mannish {79} finely without me.  We've gitten a' the hay\nin but t' midder, and that'll not take so lang.  It's nobbut a light\ncrop, and then it'll be verra slack till bracken time, and what,\nJonty's match to make a good start with that if I sudn't be back.'\n\nJust then the farm servant Jonty enters.  I believe that he was a\ncoachman in the village, but he was a consummate actor, and his\nquaint, silent ways and the lifting up of his hand and scratching his\nhead behind his ear when talking were quite admirable.  He has had,\nfrom youth up, the wish to have something from London, and he tells\nAaron that he's 'wonderin' whether he could mannish to bring him a\n\"spead\" fra Lunnon' when he comes back; 'but maybe the railway folk\nwad charge ower dear for carryin' on it.'  Aaron chaffs him out of\nthe idea that a 'spead' made in London is better than one made in\nKendal, and suggests a nice silk handkerchief.  'I never thowt o'\nthat,' says Jonty; 'that wad be as like as aught.'  Libby, the pretty\nfarm servant breaks in here, and says: 'I wish tha would think on it,\nand not be so ready with thy jacket sleeve.'\n\n'Ye'll not can tell me (says honest Jonty) how much t' silk\nhandkercher'll be until ye've {80} bought it, I doubt; but if ye'll\nsend word I can just send ye the brass in a letter.'\n\nAnd, saying, 'Well, I mun see all's reet afore goin' to bed,' the\nfaithful farm servant leaves the cottage to go round the byre.\n\nBut the actress of the piece throughout is Aaron's mother, Mrs.\nHartley.  She sits there at her knitting, with her pretty crossover\non her shoulders, sair troubled at heart by her son Aaron's love\naffair; she drops her stitches, for her eyes can hardly keep back the\ntears, but she seems to know intuitively how much and how little\ncomfort she may give her son, and how far she may insist upon his\nconfidences.  The attempt on her part to make it appear as if it did\nnot matter at all and that everything will come right in the end is\nvery bravely done.  Fewest words are best.\n\n'Good night, mother,' says Aaron.  'You'll not mind a' I've said.'\n\n'Nay, lad, not I.  Good night.'\n\nAnd so the curtain falls.  The second scene in the second act brings\nJonty and Mattha Newby (the village tailor) together.  Mattha, as I\nheard, was the son of a village tailor.  To-day, evidently from his\nboyhood's remembrances, he is able to play the tailor's part well.\nJonty has {81} been 'wrestling with a dyke' and torn his jerkin, and\nMattha volunteers to mend it.  A song was introduced into this scene\nwhich I had written for the occasion.  It ran as follows:\n\n  Come! sweet April, whom all men praise,\n  Bring your daffodils up to the Raise,\n  Bid the delicate warbler trill,\n  Come with the cuckoo over the hill\n  Sprinkle the birch with sprays of green,\n  Purple the copses all between;\n  Bend the rainbow, and swell the brooks,\n  Fill the air with the sound of rooks,\n  Rubies lend, for the larch to wear,\n  The lambs are bleating, and May is near.\n\n  August comes, and the speckled thrush\n  Sings no more in the lilac bush,\n  Lambs in the meadow cease to bleat,\n  The hills are dim with the noontide heat,\n  From all her hedges the rose is fled,\n  And only the harebell lifts her head;\n  But green are the new-mown vales with grass\n  As if the Spring were again to pass,\n  And children bring from the far-off fell\n  The rose-red heather--the bee loves well,\n\n  Comes October with breath more cold,\n  She breathes, and the bracken turns to gold,\n  The cherry blushes as red as blood,\n  The rowan flames in the painted wood,\n  The larch-tree tresses are amber bright,\n  The birch is yellowing up on the height,\n{82}\n  And over the valley and over the hill\n  A deep hush broods and the sheep are still,\n  But rainbow gossamers fill the air,\n  Tho' the old earth rests, the world is fair.\n\n  Now are the mountains winter-white,\n  Helvellyn shines in the clear moonlight;\n  The carollers sing, and the Christmas bells\n  Send sweet messages up the fells;\n  The old folk meet for their Christmas cheer,\n  The young folk skate on the frozen mere;\n  But Spring is coming, the shy buds peep,\n  The snow-drop moves in her long, long sleep,\n  The lemon-light shines on the leafless larch,\n  And the wood grows purple to welcome March.\n\n  Fair, how fair, are the changing days\n  That keep us happy beneath the Raise,\n  We who, in honour of Oswald the King,\n  Our 'bearings' still to the Old Church bring,\n  We who here in the silent time\n  Act our part and carol our rhyme.\n  Seasons change, and our hair grows grey,\n  But merrily goes the Grasmere play,\n  And two things stay with us all the year--\n  Love of our valley, and heart of cheer.\n\n\nIt had been prettily set to music by a Grasmere lady, and the two\nbass voices chimed in with the two last lines in each verse, and\nMattha the tailor and Jonty the farm servant gave great effect to the\nsong by the sudden addition of their manly notes.  Before the curtain\nfalls on this scene, we learn that the tourist (to whom {83} we were\nintroduced in the first scene), Mr. Augustus Mallister, who has heard\nthat she is an heiress, is determined, if possible, to win the heart\nof Betty Braithwaite.  He knows that Aaron's absence has made her\nheart grow fonder.  He determines to write a letter, which shall be\nposted in London, purporting to come from Aaron, in which the absent\nlover declares that he has become engaged to an American girl; and so\nthe curtain falls.\n\nIn the last act, and the first scene, there is a pretty passage,\nalthough it is a pathetic one, between Mrs. Hartley and the girl\nBetty Braithwaite, to whom Mrs. Hartley has given Aaron's letters to\nread--one of them the fatal letter.  In the last scene Norman\nBraithwaite and his wife, an excellent make-up, come in to talk\nmatters over, and the letter from London amongst other things.  Jonty\nremembers how that, on a certain day in August, the tourist chap,\n'the fine gentleman' as he called him, had been spouting out a letter\nabout an Aaron getting wed to an American, and they at once seemed to\nsee light and to feel that the letter Mrs. Hartley had received was a\nforgery.  Just at that time Aaron and Betty enter, and one can tell\nby a glance at them that it doesn't matter how many forged letters\nhave been written in {84} London; they have quite made up their minds\nto make a match of it.  As for Mallister, 'the fine gentleman,' Jonty\nbreaks in:\n\n'Is it Mallister you're talkin' on?  We weant see any more o' yon\nne'er-do-weel here.  I met t' p'liceman going off wid him to Kendal.'\n\nNorman: 'T' p'liceman!  What for?'\n\nJonty: 'It seems he's been wanted for some time.  He's been up to\nsome forgery or summat o' that mak.'\n\nPoor Mrs. Rawlinson, 'the fine gentleman's' landlady, enters greatly\ndistressed that the good name of her house has been compromised by\nletting lodgings to a forger.  'Why,' says she, 'I thought he was a\ngentleman, wi' his wawmlets to his breakfast, and his late dinners\nand siclike.'  And so with the assertion that there is nothing to\nwait for and the wedding shall take place at Martinmas, the curtain\ngoes down, and all's well that ends well.\n\nDuring the acting it was quite plain that the actors themselves were\nas much interested as those who witnessed the play.  'I was fairly\nshamed of myself,' I heard one saying, 'to meet with ye when I came\noff the last time, for the tears on my face, but if you had given me\na five pound note I could not have helped it.'  Ah, thought I, that\nwas the secret of {85} your acting so well.  Now and again an actor\nin undress would pass down the room to have a look at the others as\nthey performed their parts, and to report.  They would come back with\nmuch encouragement to their fellow-players with such words as these:\n'Eh, but it's a grand company now, and walls is beginning to stream\nnow'; and in truth the heat of the room and the consequent vapour\nbath was a thing not to be easily forgotten.  But if it had been\ntwice as hot, and the hall had been twice as crammed, and the play\nhad been twice as long, one could still have sat with real pleasure\nto see such perfect acting done with such simplicity and reality to\nthe life.  One wished that Will Shakspere could have come along; how\nhe would have blessed these village folk for their truth and their\nsimplicity.  And how good a thing, thought I, it is, that there\nshould be a dull time at the English Lakes, so that, without any\ntemptations to extravagance in scenery or setting of the plays--that\nwould inevitably come with a wider public,--these natural dale-folk\ncan delight their fellow-villagers, by dramatic talent as real as it\nis remarkable.\n\n\n\n\n{86}\n\nJAMES CROPPER OF ELLERGREEN.\n\nThe pattern life of a public-spirited country gentleman closed, when\nJames Cropper of Ellergreen, with eye undimmed and natural force\nunabated, entered rest.\n\nCome of an old Viking stock,--for his name is found in the _Landnama\nBok of Iceland_,--he had inherited the best traditions of true\nphilanthropy from his grandfather, who, with Zachary Macaulay, had\nworked for the emancipation of the slave.  In him, too, ran something\nof the spirit of good old Quaker blood.  Whole-hearted Churchman as\nhe was, he loved as the Friends love, simplicity in form and\ndirectness in religious expression.  In earliest days he had cared\nfor social and industrial problems, and the sorrows of the labouring\npoor entered into his heart.  It was his good fortune to be able, by\nbecoming an employer of labour, in his paper mills at {87} Burneside,\nto face these problems and to become, as he always wished to become,\nthe father rather than the master of his workmen.\n\nHe lived to see Burneside become, under his fostering care, a model\nvillage.  He lived to see some of his endeavours, notably his idea of\nCo-operative Stores for the people, find acceptance far and wide.\nThe guardianship of the poor was a sacred trust to him.  As Chairman\nof the Board of Guardians at Kendal for twenty-five years, and as\nVice-President of the Northern Poor Law Congress, he both learned and\ntaught wisdom.  Almost the last thing he talked with me about was a\nscheme for caring for that most helpless class of our poorer friends,\nthe pauper imbeciles of Cumberland and Westmoreland.\n\nHe was in early days a keen politician, and represented his\nneighbouring town of Kendal for five years in Parliament.  Latterly\nhe had felt that he could not be a partisan, or rather that\npartisanship dulled sympathies, and though it was a grief to him at\nthe time to leave the House at the redistribution of seats, he found\nso much more of home politics to hand for him to do, that he ceased\nto regret it.\n\nWhen the County Council in Westmoreland {88} met for its first time\nin 1888, they unanimously elected James Cropper to be their chairman,\nand to the day of his death his heart was in the work.\n\nThe Queen Anne's Bounty Board gave him the chance of helping the\nchurch of his love.  The late Bishop of Carlisle, Harvey Goodwin, had\nno truer friend; and the present Bishop Bardsley testified to the\nconstant help to church work in the diocese that this most earnest\nlayman was always willing to bestow.\n\nBut it was the cause of education--elementary, secondary, public\nschool, or university--that was nearest to his heart.  As one of the\nGovernors of Sedbergh, and Heversham and Kendal Grammar Schools, his\ncounsel was constantly sought.  As a believer in women's education,\nhe founded a scholarship at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, and a bursary\nat the Edinburgh Medical School for the training of native Indian\nwomen as doctors.\n\n[Illustration: JAMES CROPPER OF ELLERGREEN.]\n\nHe was Chairman of a Kendal Education Society which anticipated much\nof the present endeavour of the Code to secure better instruction for\nelementary teachers.  He was never so happy as when he could gather\nthe teachers on the lawn at Ellergreen, and hold counsel with them as\nto their future aims and their present {89} progress.  The idea of a\npupil-teachers' centre at Kendal was his, and as Chairman of the\nCounty Council he was able to lend it substantial aid.  When the\nVoluntary School Association came into being, he took up the idea\nwarmly, and personally visited every school within his area, and made\nits wants and its difficulties his own.\n\nThere was not a day that this public benefactor did not do something\nto help his time.  And if one asked oneself why it was he had the\npower to be a pillar of good in his generation, a kind of beacon and\nstandard for higher and happier life in all classes of society round\nabout him, the answer seemed to be that he had a heart which was for\never young, in a body that seemed as if age could not touch it--that\nhis sympathies were not with the past, but with the present and the\nfuture; that his enthusiasm for the better time coming never failed\nhim; that he believed that all things work together for good to them\nthat fear God and keep His commandments.\n\nThe grace of this abundant hopefulness flowed out in all he did and\nsaid.  'Age could not stale his infinite variety,' because he never\ngrew old.  To see him with young men or little children was to see\nhim at his best.  To {90} know him in his home life was a privilege\nfor which to be thankful.\n\nBut deeper than all his spring of hope and sympathy with the young\nand the new lay the fountain of poetry at his heart.  He did not, I\nthink, write poetry, but the love of it was a continual presence.  He\nhad the poet's heart, and entered into the poet's mind.  For him, the\npractical public county magistrate and councillor, the spirit of the\ninnermost was the joy of the imagination.  This was the secret of his\nswift sympathy with nature and with man.\n\nWe met by appointment in the Tapestry Room of the Spanish Palace at\nthe Paris Exhibition on October 12th, 1900.  He was as cheery as ever.\n\n'I have had a delightful week,' he said, 'I wish all my friends could\nhave seen this wonderful exhibition.  Yesterday I was at Chartres\nCathedral.  I never knew what stained glass was before; pray visit\nChartres.  It is a revelation to one.'  Then he turned to the Spanish\ntapestries and went with deepest pleasure through the historic scenes\nthat the needles of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries have left\non deathless record.  He seemed as young-hearted as a boy, and as\nfresh in his enthusiasm as if this Paris {91} Exhibition was the\nfirst he had ever seen, but he was seventy-seven and had seen more\nthan falls to most of us to see, of all this world can show.  I did\nnot know as I shook hands and parted that Death already had shaken\nhim by the hand.\n\nThat night the sharp pain of pneumonia was upon him.  I saw him once\nagain, at the bedside celebration of his last Holy Communion, and\nthen I saw him dead.  His beautiful lace without a wrinkle in it with\nall the look of youthfulness come back--but, alas, without the bloom,\nbeneath that ample crown of snow-white hair which for years past had\nadded such dignity to his refined and kindly presence.  As I gazed,\nthe one thought that came to me was this, did ever man pass so little\nweary, so full of keen interest and unabated enthusiasm after so long\na pilgrimage, right up to the doors of that other world where, as we\ntrust, all his fullest powers shall find full play, or enter these\ngates of life with so little pain?\n\nHe died in France and his body was borne across the sea and laid to\nrest in the valley he held most dear.  It seemed as if all\nWestmoreland and Cumberland had come to Burneside to do him honour at\nthe homegoing.\n\n{92}\n\nThe coffin, covered with wreaths, was laid upon a simple wheeled bier\nin front of the doors of Ellergreen, and so taken by hand from the\nhouse to the church.  It was his wish that no hearse should be used,\nand that this simpler method of carrying the body to its rest should\nbe employed.  Before the procession moved, many of those present came\nup to the coffin to see the beautiful photograph taken after death;\nand side by side of it the picture of his bride taken on her\nhoneymoon.  Beneath these two pictures were written the words from\nChristina Rossetti's poem:\n\n  'Think of our joy in Paradise\n  When we're together there,'\n\nand beneath this a little note stating that these were the words\nwhich he had begged might be inscribed upon his tombstone.\n\nThose who knew how ideal had been their wedded life, knew also how\nthrough all the long years of widowerhood and the grief of separation\nthat lent its pathos to his fine face, there had been one sweet music\nto which he moved--the music of the hope of a sure reunion, that had\nsurely come with joy at last.\n\nThe sunlight faded from the near fells, and {93} sorrow filled the\nair.  A single robin sang a note or two and was silent, and the\nleaves fell audibly to the ground.  But all who gazed out east saw\nthe blue Howgills and the further Pennine range shine out like\nburnished silver and gold, and thought of the glory of that far land\nto which our friend had gone.\n\nThe procession went up the drive and into the lane, and so down into\nthe village, where every head seemed bowed and every home a house of\nmourning.  The service, simple throughout, included his favourite\nhymn:\n\n  'Lord, it belongs not to my care\n  Whether I live or die,'\n\nand at the grave side a third hymn was sung which had been chosen by\nhis daughter as expressive of the continuity of happy life in the\nworld beyond.  The bishop pronounced the benediction, the mourners\nplaced their wreaths at the grave side; silently the vast crowd\nmelted away, and left to its long rest the body of one of the most\npublic-spirited servants of the common good that Westmoreland has\nknown.  He will be as sorely missed as he will be surely mourned.\n\n\n\n\n{94}\n\nA DAY WITH ROMAN AND NORSE.\n\nIt was burning June.  The sun shone on lake and fell.  Skiddaw was\ncloudless and lifted into the clear heaven its purple lilac shade\npowdered with the fresh fern and the emerald green of the bilberry.\nThe corn-crake cried in the valley, the throstle whistled from the\nlarch plantation; in and out of the elder-blossom the tireless bees\nwent humming, and the haymakers could hardly get on with their work\nfor gazing at the exquisite beauty of the wild roses on the hedge.\nIn Cumberland, as Southey said, we miss the violet, but we make up\nfor our loss in April and May by the blush roses of the June.  They\nembroider the lanes, they dance upon the hedgerows, they flash\nagainst the grey blue waters of the lake, they flutter against the\ngreen fellside.  Such roses! not faint in {95} colour and scent as we\nsee in the South, but red of heart and filled with fragrance,\nwonderful wild roses of Cumberland.\n\nWhat a day of life and loveliness it is!  On the old Millbeck Hall\ndoor stone up yonder are the words, 'Vivere mori, mori vivere,' but\nwe feel that the living, the living are the hearts that praise, and\ndeath is, even by suggestion, out of place here.\n\nTo-day as we dash along under Skiddaw to see where Roman and Norseman\nonce had home, we feel that the same beauty was beheld by earlier\nraces, and the wild rose that gladdens our sight was very dear to\neyes of far-off generations, and has been a perpetual garden of life\nand loveliness for all the passing years.\n\nWe are going to see the camps of the warriors of old, and we do well\nto gather and put in hat and buttonhole the emblem of England's\nwarrior saint, the good St. George.  As one thinks of the flower,\none's mind does not only go back to Pisanello and his picture of St.\nGeorge away there in the church of St. Anastasia in Verona, but to\nthe hundred shrines wherein are seen that fair Madonna, the Rose of\nGod, whose painters honoured the wilding rose for her {96} sake, and\ngave it immortality on their canvases.  To Roman Catholic and to\nProtestant alike, how significant and full of tender association is\nthe wild dog-rose of Cumberland!  How close it brings the church days\nof an older time back to the present dwellers in this country, seeing\nthat both on Carlisle's city arms and Carlisle's bishop's coat of\narms, the wild rose shines, memorial of the monastery that honoured\nthe Rose of Heaven.\n\nBut to-day we are going back to times that antedate those mediaeval\nchurch days.  We are on visit bent to Roman and Viking who dwelt in\nsight of Skiddaw--the cleft one, in the days,\n\n  'When never a wild-rose men would braid\n  To honour St. George and the Virgin Maid.'\n\nWe dash on by Dancing Gate, a farm beyond Scalebeck, with its quaint\nholly trees, whose sons have never forgotten the art of dancing, on\nby Mirehouse with its memories of James Spedding and Thomas Carlyle\nand Alfred Tennyson, on under Ullock slope, and by Ravenstone till we\nreach an old farmhouse, quaint with its Jacobaean door-pilasters.\n\n'For Orthwaite Hall and Overwater,' said the coachman, 'we should\nturn off here to {97} the right and go up the Rake,' as he slackened\nhis paces.\n\nThere was an old Norse ring about that word 'rake,' for the\nIcelanders still talk of their sheep '_rachan_' just as our\nCumberland shepherds do; when the sheep follow one after another\nalong the mountain side, they are hereabouts said to be 'raking,' but\nthough we were bent on a Norse chieftain's home we refused to ascend\nthe Rake.  It was very hot and sultry, and we preferred the shady\nwoodland of Bassenthwaite 'parks,' and so drove forward.  We passed\nthe Vicarage house and the Bassenthwaite Church, crossed a small\nstream, and, turning sharply by a deserted chapel towards the\nvillage, drove by the village green, thence entering a kind of meadow\nroad, were soon in shadow, and for more than a mile went, beneath\nbowery oak, and fragrant larch, and gleaming hazel, along this\ncopse-lane sweet with wild woodruff and gay with lychnis, towards the\nhillside opposite the Dash, where stands Orthwaite or Overthwaite\nHall.  It is worth while turning for a backward gaze as we ascend the\nhill; Bassenthwaite and the fells that close round far Derwentwater\nlook nowhere more beautiful than from here.\n\n{98}\n\nThat little tarn on our left is not Overwater, but it has its\nhistory; one hundred sheep went on the ice one wintry day, broke\nthrough, and all were drowned.  The current superstition is that the\npike in that tarn are as large as donkeys; whether before or after\nthe feast of plenty accorded by the mountain sheep is not told.\n\nHere is Orthwaite or Allerthwaite Hall grim and grey, its little\nElizabethan window mouldings, its diamond squares of glass, its\nquaint low-ceilinged dining room.  There is a look of drear sadness\nand of pale sorrow about the quiet half-hall, half-farmstead, and\nthere may well be, for its owner William George Browne, the\ntraveller, went forth therefrom to explore Tartary and Bokhara in the\nyear 1812, and being suspected by the Persian government of sinister\ndesign, was, under instruction from headquarters, taken captive\nbeyond the Kizzil Ozan river, blindfolded and barbarously murdered.\nPoor Browne! he had better have stayed in sight of harmless Skiddaw,\nbut his was the gipsy's mind, and though none knew quite why he\njourneyed, and his journeys in Africa, Egypt, and Syria show that he\ntravelled more from love of wild roaming than for aught else, home\nfor William George Browne had {99} no attraction in its sound.  His\nwas the restless wanderer's heart.\n\nNow we leave the carriage, and while it goes round to pick us up at\nWhitefield Cottage on the Uldale and Ireby road, we descend into the\nmeadows and find ourselves gazing on a large square entrenchment, at\nthe angles of which were once raised mounds, lying to the south-west\nof Overwater.  No Roman camp this, for Romans did not place their\ncamps in the bottoms, unless they had a secure look-out above them,\nor a fortified camp on a height near by; and Romans did not when they\ndug an entrenchment round their camp, throw the earth out to right\nand left and make an embankment either side their fosse, as it is\nplain was the case here; besides there is but one entrance to the\ncamp, and that was not the Roman way.  No, the camp we are looking\nupon was probably the kraal or stockaded farmstead of a Norse\nchieftain, any time between 874 and 950 A.D.\n\nIts owner probably came up the Derwent with Ketel, son of Orme, with\nSweyn and Honig or Hundhr, what time they harried Cumberland under\nIngolf or Thorolf the Dane.  For aught we know, he may have been\ntempted hither by some sudden surprise-peep he got {100} of the\nOverwater tarn and neighbouring meadowland, from the heights of\nSkiddaw, the first time he clomb that double-fronted hill.\n\nIt is true that a Roman tripod kettle is said to have been discovered\nnear, but the Romans were not the only nation on the earth that\nworked in bronze, and knew the advantage of putting legs to their\nkettles; and both in the museum of Copenhagen and Christiania such\ntripod kettles may be seen to-day that came from the hands of the\nNorsemen of old time.\n\nAs we gaze across the quiet meadow land to the north-east, we see the\nhigh raised hill, where it is more than probable that the Viking\nchieftains, who here had their steading, 'died into the ground,' as\nthey expressed it, when the death hour came.  At any rate that hill\nis called Latrigg, which may well mean the 'Hlad Rigg' or 'Ridge of\nthe Dead,' and as at Keswick so here, the Vikings may have carried up\ntheir dead chieftains for their last long rest to yonder height.  It\nis by some thought possible that the word Latrigg may come from Norse\nwords that signify the 'Lair Ridge,' the ridge of the lair of wild\nbeasts, and doubtless in those early days the farmer who built his\nstockade had cause to dread other wild beasts than such as now\ntrouble the hen roosts {101} beneath Skiddaw.  Now on still nights\nthe shepherd of Underskiddaw may hear the fox of Skiddaw calling\nacross the waters of Bassenthwaite to the red-coated vixen at Barf,\nand hear her shrill bark answer to his cry, but then the wolf howled\nand the wild boar prowled, and there was need of stockade not only\nagainst man but against the creatures of the wild woodland.\n\nWe leave the meadow with its Viking memories, walk on to join our\ncarriage at Whitefield Cottage, thence, driving along towards Uldale\nand Ireby, see, far off, the common of Ulph the Norseman that was\noften waked by John Peel's 'horn in the morning,' and, instead of\ndescending into the valley that separates us from that long moor that\nstretches to Caldbeck, we turn sharply to the left, pass a lonely\nhouse of some pretension, and drive by a narrow lane through hedges\ncovered with wild-rose; away to the west, upon surmounting the ridge,\nwe suddenly come in sight of the littoral plain--all peacock green\nand blue, the Solway flashing in the distance--and the grey hills of\nbonnie Scotland beyond.  We descend the hill and pull up at a lodge\ngate.  \"Snittle Garth,\" says the driver.  The very name has a\nScandinavian ring about it; we enter the {102} Park and pull up at a\npleasant-looking country house.\n\nBy courtesy of the owner we pass in front of the garden, gay with its\nflowers, and full of the sense and sweetness of an English country\nhouse.  We can hardly gaze at the camp we have come to see, so fair\nand beautiful is the vision outstretched before us of Bassenthwaite\nlaid in gleaming whiteness beneath the dark hills of Wythop and the\npurple vastness of Skiddaw, so exquisite the shadowy foldings of the\nblue hills that take the eye far up beyond the gates of Borrodale to\nGimmer Crag, to Great-End and far Sea-fell.  But when we look at the\ncamp we have come to see we find ourselves standing on a high\nplateau, sheltered on north and east and west by rising ground.  The\nsite of the camp is rectangular, eighty-three feet by thirty-one;\nisolated by a trench with regular scarp and counter-scarp.  This\ntrench is twelve feet broad at the bottom, twenty feet at the top;\nthe scarp and counter-scarp are each nine feet, and the depth is five\nfeet.  The work, to all appearance, is freshly done, and but for the\nfact that no pottery has been revealed, might well be work of Roman\nengineers.  As we wonder at the quaint oblong island of green carved\nin {103} the hill side, surrounded by its dry moat, we listen to what\nthe sages say and archaeologists guess about its origin and intent.\n\n'The remains of a mediaeval pleasaunce,' says one antiquarian.\n\n'Not a bit of it,' says another, 'this was no sheet of water for\nornament, with an island in its midst, this was a Roman sanitary\ncamp.  Hither sick and sorry came the poor fellows, whom the frosts\nof Cumberland had pinched, or the dews of Cumberland had rheumatised,\nor the malaria of the Derwent Vale had febrified, or the swords and\nclubs of the stubborn British had wounded, and here girt round by\nfriendly fence of water, sheltered from the wind, uplifted in this\nquiet pastoral scene, they built their rough wattle hospital, and\nprayed to the goddess of health.'\n\n'No, no,' says a third antiquarian, no authority he, and therefore\nlikeliest to be right.  'This was a battle holme.  Here in the olden\ntime men met for holm-gauge or wager of battle; on that oval sward\nwas decided, in the sight of the assembled multitude, the feud of\nfamilies or the strife of tribes.'\n\nWe can, as we gaze, conjure up the whole scene, and hear the crash of\nbattle hammer, and see the flame of the circling brand; but the {104}\npeace of the present subdues the passion of the past, and the sound\nof the quiet grass-cropping hard by of the unfearful sheep, the song\nof the thrush from the neighbour sycamore recalls us to such pastoral\ntranquillity as ill assorts with the stormy drama\n\n  'Of old far-off unhappy things\n  And battles long ago.'\n\n\nNow rejoining our carriage let us drive west, up hill, to the\nneighbouring Caermote.  We shall feel all the time that the\ntribesmen, gathered at their battle holme, can follow us with their\neyes, and wonder what on earth can possess us to leave them with\ntheir fierce axe play just going to begin, for the old deserted\nlook-out camp on the slope a mile away.  We leave the carriage to\ndescend the hill to the south and await our arrival at the large\nsquare double camp of the Romans on the lower slope, and not without\nmany pauses to wonder at fair scene of the seaward plain, we make our\nway up to the northern peak of Caermote Hill.\n\nThis, with its circular rampart, was probably the 'mons\nexploratorius' of the large double camp on the lower south-eastern\nslope, and a glorious look-out the Roman legionaries must have had,\nif on such a day of June they came {105} with their wild roses in\ntheir hands to see the sun come with its wild rose over Helvellyn, or\nmove slowly to its setting and turn the whole grey Solway into gold.\n\nDown now we go southward across the pleasant green sward, negotiate\none or two rather awkward fences, and bearing a little to the left,\ntowards the main road that runs to Bewaldeth, we soon find ourselves\nin the midst of ramparts of the quaint double Roman camp.  It is a\ncamp within a camp, the larger of the two being about 180 yards by\n160 yards square.  There is evidence that the cohort that first\nencamped here must have felt that it was a place of much strategic\nimportance, for they made the road from 'old Carlisle' to Keswick run\nright through the middle of it.  The continuation of this road,\nthough it remains untraced, probably ran along the east side of\nBassenthwaite up to the tiny Roman watch camp at the 'Gale,' and so\nby Guardhouse towards Penrith, and to Causeway Foot, on the road to\nAmbleside.\n\nThey appear also to have felt that they were in a dangerous country\nwhen first they rested beneath Caermote, for they circled themselves\nwith a triple rampart and a double fosse.\n\n{106}\n\nBut not for ever was there to be war at the gates, even in Roman\ntimes.  The cohort gave way to a 'century,' and the centurion, who\nremained to keep the way from 'old Carlisle' to Keswick open, was\ncontent to trust his safety from attack to the guardianship of a\nsingle ditch and rampart; and yet the fierceness of fire and sword\nmust in after times have been felt again at this place.  Not many\nyears ago the ruins of some buildings near the north gate of the\nlarge camp were discovered, that had once been roofed with lead, but\nthe buildings had been set on fire, and the lead had poured itself\naway into the ground.  There was nothing to suggest that these\nbuildings had been of Roman workmanship, and though it is possible\nthat this was a kind of half-way store-house for the lead miners of\nCaldbeck, who were sending their mineral booty to the sea, it is\nquite as probable that at some time or other a farmer had here his\n'strength' or 'strong house,' and that 'rievers' from over the Border\nhad made short work of him, and given his farm-stead to the flames.\n\nWe leave the Romans of Caermote, and are not surprised to think a\nsanatorium hard by was necessary for the cohort of old time, if there\nwas as much water in the ground as there is {107} to-day within and\nwithout the ramparts.  Thence we drive by way of Bewaldeth and the\ninn by the Bassenthwaite cross-roads, to the shores of what Southey\ncalled 'westernmost Wythop.'  Hardly are we able to get forward, for\nthe cries of those who are with us in the carriage to draw up, that\nwe may gaze at this or that wild-rose bush in all its tender\nfluttering beauty.  But at last we win our goal--Castle How Inn, near\nPeelwyke; then scrambling up the hill we inspect the four trenches on\nthe side of the hill looking towards Peelwyke, whence of old time\ngazed out the hardy Britons upon the Roman camp fires blazing at\nCaermote.\n\nAs we gaze we think not only of Roman times, but of the Viking times\nalso; for down below us lies the wyke or harbour where the first\nNorsemen who ever came up Derwent from the sea ran their boats ashore.\n\nWho, or whence the Norse ancestor of John Peel, who hewed the trees\nof the woodland at our feet into planks and built his 'Pride of the\nlake,' we cannot know, but he probably had friends, Ketel and Ormr,\nand Sweyn, and Honig and Walla, who would from time to time come\nacross the Crosthwaite Vale and step aboard his galley, and sweep\nwith flying sail or gleaming oar along by the woods of Mirehouse\n{108} or the shadowy cliffs of Barf to his 'steading' here at\nBassenthwaite; and it is more than probable that he and his family\n'died into the ground' at Castle How, and there await the glory of\nthe gods and the coming of Odin.\n\nWe, as we gaze out south from the How of the Viking, can see plainly\nto-day the burial ground of other Viking chieftains of the dale on\nthe grey green Latrigg's height; and sadly enough, we think, must\nthey have passed into the dark, if so fair a sun as this shone upon\nso fair a scene, and the roses and elders were as sweet for them as\nthey are for us to-day.\n\nOn now through fragrant briar wood and odorous larch to Keswick, and\nthe ghosts of Britain and Rome and Norway keep pace with our hearts\nas we go.\n\n\n\n\n{109}\n\nARCTIC SPLENDOURS AT THE ENGLISH LAKES.\n\nThe blizzard brought a greater gift of snow to the hills of the\nEnglish Lake District than had been remembered since 1859.  The storm\nleft behind it a bewitching splendour, and Skiddaw and Helvellyn and\nGlaramara and Grassmoor never shone more fair.  Into clear air above\nthe Yorkshire fells the great sun rose.  The heavens flushed above\nHelvellyn, and presently the steep, angular cleft on Grisedale was\nfilled with blue shadow.  Then the light splintered upon Causey Pike\nand Hindscarth, and Scafell shone like a jewel of flame above the sea\nof deathly white.  Five minutes later the blank white snowfield of\nDerwentwater was changed into a gleaming floor of dazzling light, and\nall the encircling hills seemed ivory washed with gold.  A lilac veil\nof haze rose from the {110} Crosthwaite Valley and drifted up the\nsnow slopes, growing more gossamer-like as it touched the ridges of\nthe hills, and soon the mountains stood as clear as at the dawn\nagainst a cloudless sky.\n\nSuch blue of heaven touched the cones of Skiddaw as one sees on a\nclear May morning above the Oberland peaks, and one wondered why it\nwas that people who have no chance of seeing Switzerland did not take\nthe opportunity of realising a Switzerland in miniature when it was\nclose beside their doors.  One reads of excursions to the Palace of\nVarieties at Manchester and Blackpool.  How comes it about that no\nexcursions are planned to such a world of varieties, such ivory\npalaces of winter's garnishing and nature's building, as, after heavy\nsnowfall, may be found in Cumberland?\n\nThe frost was still in the shade within 10 degrees of zero; on\nChestnut Hill it had been registered in the early morning as being\nwithin 4 degrees.  People as they went about the roads felt their\nfeet almost ring upon the snow, and children who tumbled into the\npowder rose and shook the fine dust from their hair and laughed to\nfind they were as dry as a bone.  The rooks above were silent {111}\nand grave as they sat in solemn conclave on the ash tree at the\nstable-end and waited for such happy chances as the cook or\nchicken-man might give them.  They were frozen out.  Their tools were\nuseless.  But the tits were merry enough--blue tit, great tit, and\ncole tit; how they clung and spun and scooped at the cocoanuts and\nbones upon their Christmas tree!  How the thrush pecked at the suet;\nhow the starling and blackbird gobbled at the softened scraps upon\nthe ground; and how the chaffinch and the robin partook of the crumbs\nthat fell from the rich bird's table, as those crumbs came floating\ndown from suet-lump or cocoanut above!\n\nBut we are off for a walk up to that old burial ground of the Viking\nchieftains from the land of the Frost Giants, which we still call the\nRidge of Death--Latrigg of to-day.  There, beside the path that leads\nfrom the main road, is the golf ground, but golf has been\ndispossessed by a fitter game for this season, and down the long\nslide shoot the tobogganers, and up the hill, with glowing faces and\nin silver clouds of their own breath, the happy people move.  As one\ngazes into the valley another group of people in the {112}\nneighbouring hollow may be seen hard at work with brush and curling\nstones, for the Keswick folk are some of them devotees to the rink,\nand the noise of the curlers fills the air to-day.\n\nWe climb Latrigg, noting how the blizzard has swept some of the snow\nfrom Skiddaw's western flank, and let the long yellow grasses and\number-coloured heather once more give their beauty of pencilling to\nthe otherwise snow-white damask of their winter cloak.  Thence, after\nfar sight of the snow upon the Scotch hills sacred to the name of\nCuthbert and the memory of his mission in Strathclyde, and near sight\nof the island hermitage, like a black jewel in the snow-field of the\nlake, which keeps the memory of St. Cuthbert's friend Herebert safe\nin mind, we descend to the vale.\n\n[Illustration: ARCTIC SPLENDOURS AT THE LAKES.]\n\nAs we descend we have a friendly crack with a shepherd from the high\nfells, whose dog has cleverly found and 'crowned' a handful of the\nHerdwick sheep prisoned by a snowdrift against a wall.  How did he do\nthis?  'Naay, I cannot tell tha, but I suppose t' dog nosed 'em, ye\nkna; dogs is wonderful keen scented.'  And had the sheep taken hurt?\n'Naay, naay; they were {113} safe and warm as could be; they hedn't\neven begun to woo' yan anudder.'  Wool one another, what's that?\n'Oh, sheep, poor things, when they git snowbound and hev nowt to eat,\nteks to eatin' woo' off t' backs, to prevent pinin', ye kna.'  So\nsaying, the shepherd goes off, to quest for more, up to the land of\nloneliness and wintry wild, and I go down into the cheery vale.\n\nHow blue the snow is; you might have supposed the fields out 'Wythop'\nway had been washed with ultramarine; but one's eyes are caught back\nby the beauty of the snowdrifts by the roadside.  These snowdrifts\nare for all the world as if great waves of milk had curled over to\nbreaking, and at the moment had been fixed or changed into\ncrystalline marble.  And now the sun is gathering its glory back into\nitself, and hangs a globe of flame above 'Whinlatter' Pass.  Suddenly\nthe light goes out from all the valley meadows.  The day star has\nsunk behind the hills.  But still old Skiddaw flashes back the flame,\nand shepherds, out Newlands way, can see the bastions of Blencathra\nglow like molten gold.\n\nFor us, as we gaze out south, the range of Helvellyn is the miracle\nof beauty that {114} holds our eyes.  Far off and ghostly for the\nhaze, it lies upon a background of rosy flushing afterglow, and seems\nto faint into a kind of impalpable phantom of its former\nstrength--becomes no longer solid mountain, but spectral cloud.  A\nlight wind blows, and the oak leaves in the hedge tinkle like iron;\nthe farmer calls the horse to get his hay, the wren chirrups or\nscolds from the wayside bank, and a partridge cries from the near\nfield.  Then all is silent and hushed for the coming of the queen.\nOver the dark pines upon Skiddaw, and above the silver shoulder of\nthe hill, clear-faced and full, the February moon swims up to rule\nthe night.  And such a reign of splendour was then begun as I have no\nwords to chronicle.  For the heaven above Helvellyn was rosy pink,\nmelting into blue, and the sky above Skiddaw was, or seemed to be,\nsteel azure, and the west beyond the Wythop range was gleaming amber.\nThere, in the midst of that golden sea, shone Venus like a point of\nsilver fire.  Sirius rose and scintillated above Helvellyn's ridge,\nJupiter looked clear from near the zenith, and Orion girt his starry\nsword about him in mid-heaven; but it was the Moon who was the queen\nof all our hearts.  It was she who {115} laid her mystery upon the\nlakes, the hills, the valleys, white with snow; she who made one feel\nthat if sunrise and sunsetting had been fair to-day, the moon-rising\nin a land of Arctic splendour had been fairer still.\n\n\n\n\n{116}\n\nWILLIAM PEARSON OF BORDERSIDE.\n\nIt is a pleasant thing for a Cumberland Crosthwaite man to have to\nspeak of a man of the Westmoreland Crosthwaite.  It is a special\npleasure when one realises how Cumberland helped Westmoreland to give\nus the gentle mind and life of enthusiasm for Truth and Nature which\nclosed here at Borderside, with 'unbroken trust in God,' and 'in hope\nof immortal life,' on the 16th December, 1856.\n\nI have read no life that seems to have been so genuinely the fruit of\nenthusiasm for the poet Wordsworth as was the life of William\nPearson.  He was ten years the junior of the poet, and survived him\nsix years.  We may nevertheless look upon him as a contemporary.  He\nwas of the same kind of North yeoman stock, and with greater\nopportunities might have made himself a name {117} in the annals of\nliterature.  As it is, like Elihu Robinson of Egglesfield, like\nWilkinson of Yanwath, like the late Wilson Robinson of Winfell,\nLorton, Pearson's name was not known far beyond his native valley,\nbut of him, as of the others named, it is truth to say that he was a\nliving monument of what 'the soul of Nature,' if it be received into\nthe heart of man, can do to elevate, to strengthen and refine.  Of\nnone other in his simple estatesman rank that I have read of can it\nbe more truly said, that from:\n\n  '... Nature and her overflowing soul\n  He had received so much, that all his thoughts\n  Were steeped in feeling.'\n\n\nWordsworth once wrote that 'Nature never did betray the heart that\nloved her'; William Pearson proved by all he said and did that\nWordsworth spoke the truth.  Wordsworth spoke felicitously of the\n\n          'Harvest of a quiet eye\n  That sleeps and broods on its own heart.'\n\nWilliam Pearson gathered that harvest to the full, ere he too, like a\nshock of corn, was in a full time garnered.  Wordsworth declared that\n\n  'Who feels contempt for any living thing\n  Hath faculties that he hath never used,'\n\n{118} and William Pearson put that assertion to good proof.  Few men\nin his day and station in this country went down to the grave with\nlarger heart, of wider sympathy and more love for all created things.\n\nWilliam Pearson was born at the Yews in the Winster Vale on the 9th\nof October, 1780.  His father, who died at the age of 81 in the year\n1840, was long remembered as a quiet, studious farmer, who would ever\nread a book at his meals, and made a practice of going afield at\nnights to gaze upon the heavens.  The stars in their courses helped\nhim to reverence and to thought.  William's mother--a Little from the\nBorderland--survived her husband and died at the age of 88 in 1842.\nWhile she span at her flax-wheel she used to delight her little son\nWilliam with folklore stories and fairy tales, but she was chiefly\nremembered in the village for her bright activity and energy to the\nlast.  Many a time, when she was between seventy and eighty years\nold, on market day morning, though the horse stood saddled at the\ndoor, the old lady would say, 'Nay, hang it, I'll never fash wid it,'\nand would set off on foot to Kendal, with her butter basket\ncontaining twenty to thirty pounds of butter, a distance {119} of six\nmiles and a half, and after 'standing the market' and shopping, would\nwalk home again with her purchases.\n\nAs a youngster, William's education was left to the wild beauty of\nhis native vale.  If ever there was a boy of whom Nature might have\nsaid:\n\n  'Myself will to my darling be\n  Both law and impulse: and with me\n    The _Boy_, in rock and plain,\n  In earth and heaven, in glade and bower\n  Shall feel an overseeing power\n    To kindle or restrain,'\n\nit was the boy who went afield with his father as soon as he could\ntoddle, and who in Nature's kindly school got to know by heart and\neye the hills and scars of the neighbourhood, the tarns and\nmoorlands, the trotting brooks, the rivers running to the sea, the\ngreat estuary and marsh, with all their bird and beast and flower\nlife.  He never forgot his first sight of Windermere and Morecambe\nBay, nor his first journey up Troutbeck over the Kirkstone Pass; and\nno sooner had he left home for work elsewhere than he felt that there\nwas only one place on this earth where life was worth living and that\nwas the Winster Vale.\n\n{120}\n\nIt is true that he went to the Crosthwaite school and proved himself\nearly to be a master of figures.  The author who fascinated him then\nwas Defoe.  _The Memoirs of a Cavalier_ and _Robinson Crusoe_ were\nhis teachers.  From Crosthwaite school he went to Underbarrow and\ndistinguished himself there chiefly for having the pluck to stand up\nto the big bully and thrash him in defence of the oppressed\nyoungster.  He became out of school times an expert and ardent\nfollower of Isaac Walton.  Years after, he wrote an appreciative\npaper which is extant on Walton and Cotton's _Complete Angler_, which\nhe begins with the sentence, 'Among our most favourite books is The\nComplete Angler of Isaac Walton.'  The boys of Underbarrow noticed\nthat he hugged his garret where the owls built, and was often deep in\nold romances of _Amadis de Gaul_ and _Roncesvalles_ when others were\nout and away up the fells.  But in the holidays he followed\nbark-peeling, not so much as that thus he might earn something that\nwould pay for his schooling, as because in the months of May and June\nwhen the bark-peelers went to their fragrant task in the woods, there\nwas a fine chance of becoming acquainted with the life-history {121}\nof many of our feathered visitors that were nesting at that time.  In\nautumn his delight was to be after the woodcocks, and great was his\njoy,\n\n  'With store of springes o'er his shoulder hung,\n  To range the open heights where woodcocks run\n  Along the smooth green turf.  Through half the night,\n  Scudding away from snare to snare, he plied\n  That anxious visitation.'\n\n\nIn his copy of Wordsworth's _Prelude_, the marker, at his death, was\nfound placed at this passage, and he never tired of telling the story\nof his woodcock adventures.\n\nHis first work in life was to act as teacher in the Winster village\nschool; he went thence to be tutor to the four children of a widow\nbody at Cartmel Fell, but at the end of the year gave up teaching to\ntake the place of a grocer's assistant at Kendal.\n\nHe was only there a year, but it was an eventful one in William\nPearson's life.  He made the acquaintance of Benjamin Gough, the\nblind botanist, and it is possible that he was led by him into\nenquiry not only into the wonders of plant life, but of the life of\nthat most delicate of all plants, the religious faith of the human\nsoul.  It is certain that during this year William Pearson's chief\n{122} study was the study of the Hebrew Scriptures and the Church\nDoctrine, and the end of it was that he reasoned and read himself out\nof Episcopalianism into Unitarianism, as his father had in the past\ndone before him.  He found rest to his young soul in the thought of\nthe great Fatherhood of God, and worshipped in the old Presbyterian\nMeeting House, where sometimes in after years Wordsworth also\nworshipped, and near by which lie the ashes of the James Patrick of\nKendal, who was the original of the Wanderer in _The Prelude_.  It\nmay be fancy, but I like to think that it was in that chapel that the\nyoung lad first saw the man whose writings did more for him all\nthrough life than any other--I mean William Wordsworth.\n\nFrom Kendal, William went, as was the wont of many a Kendal\napprentice, to a grocer's shop in London, and at the end of three\nmonths he returned to the Winster Vale, broken in health from the\nstifle of London air, and the fact that he had no better resting\nplace after long days of work in a city store than a shake-down\nunderneath the counter.  He was now in his twenty-third year.  The\n'poddish' and fresh air of the {123} Yews set him 'agate' again, and\nhe determined to try Manchester life, and on the 16th March, 1803, he\nset out for that metropolis of the North.  He obtained a situation on\nthe next day after his arrival as clerk in the bank of James Fox &\nCompany, in King Street, and for the next seventeen years he endured\n\n      'The fierce confederate storm\n  Of sorrow barricadoed evermore\n  Within the walls of cities.'\n\n\nHow simple and frugal his life was there, we may gather from the fact\nthat out of his first year's stipend of Â£75 he sent back a deposit to\none of the Kendal banks.  He was not very happy.  He wanted friends\nof his age 'who united,' as he tells us, 'those first of blessings,\nvirtue and knowledge,' and they were not.  'Indeed, sir,' he writes\nto James Watson of Kendal, 'I think Manchester, in proportion to its\npopulation, very deficient in men of cultivated understanding.\nImmersed in business, or carried down the stream of dissipation,\nslaves to \"Mammon\" and to \"Bacchus,\" they have seldom time for the\nrational amusement of reading or for the calm pleasure of reflection.'\n\n{124}\n\nThis seems somewhat priggish, but it was the real and earnest William\nPearson who spoke.  Sociable as he was, fond of seeing a good play,\nhis chief delight, if he was not out in the fields, was a book that\nwould set him thinking or a poem that would touch his imagination,\nand Pearson was old beyond his years.  He joined the Didactical\nSociety, the Mosley Street Library, subscribed to the News Room and\nmade one or two friends for life.\n\nThere in most uncongenial surroundings for seventeen years he stuck\nto 'the drudgery at the desk's dead wood' with one thought, that a\ntime would arrive when he could come back to his native vale, and\nlive a student's and a naturalist's life in simple competence.  As a\nmatter of fact his health broke down after five years of Manchester\nsmoke, and he had to come back in 1808 to the Yews in his native vale\nfor country air and restoration.\n\nHe was at this time nothing if not a keen sportsman, and he was, if\none may judge from a letter he sent at this time to a Kendal paper,\nvexed at heart by the vigorous application of the game laws as\nenforced by the worthies of the local bench.  Three young men, who,\nwith nothing but a knob-stick, could run down {125} a hare, had been\ncaught hunting on Cartmel Fell.  'We must pity the Robinsons,' he\nsays, 'young men who can run down a hare, an animal that often\nescapes the fleetest greyhound, who pursued their sport without fear\nin the open day, and so generously, that they left a hare with the\nfarmer on whose ground they happened to take it.  These fine young\nmen have been made to pay Â£3 13s. 6d. for their sport.  The age of\nchivalry is indeed gone.  The ancient Greeks would have crowned them\nwith laurel, but this is the age of taxation and little men.  We are\nfallen on evil days; we only wish the surveyor and commissioner had\nheard them at their joyous sport, and had heard their shouts, as we\ndid, which made the old mountains ring again even to Gummershow, to\nbe echoed back from the far-off Coniston Fells.'\n\nIt was during his Manchester residence that he became a student of\nWilliam Wordsworth.  It was not fashionable then to care for\nWordsworth's poetry, but William Pearson was never without the\nLyrical Ballads of 1805, or his copy of _Poems by William\nWordsworth_, of 1807.  The young bank clerk, who was often heard\nmuttering, 'I will lift mine eyes unto the hills, whence cometh aid,'\nfelt in these {126} poems 'all the beauty of a common dawn.'  He knew\nthat Wordsworth walked on the shining uplands of a noble aspiration,\nand was the apostle, in a time 'that touched monied worldlings with\ndismay,' of the simpler life of honest poverty and high endeavour.\nHe felt that in Wordsworth he could find that sympathy with all\nthings, that\n\n  'Look to the Uncreated with a countenance\n  Of admiration and an eye of love.'\n\nHe knew that Wordsworth had realised the power of Nature to chasten\nand subdue\n\n                      'and intertwine\n  The passions that build up our human soul\n  Not with the mean and vulgar works of man\n  But with high objects and enduring things.'\n\nHe also knew how Wordsworth taught men the secret of the gentle heart,\n\n  'Never to blend its pleasure or its pride,\n  With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.'\n\n\nIt was this knowledge that soon made him love rather to watch a wild\nbird than shoot it.  One is not surprised therefore to find him\nconstantly referring to Wordsworth's writings, and yet to feel him so\neminent as a man that years after, though communing in spirit with\n{127} him day by day, he could not summon courage to go up the path\nto Rydal Mount, and abashed at his own boldness for venturing to\ncall, came away from the door of the Rydal poet, without seeing his\nhero, like a thing ashamed.\n\nIt was owing to mutual love and admiration for Wordsworth's poetry\nthat he found in a poor Gorton silk-weaver, Thomas Smith by name, so\ncongenial a companion.  The last six years of Pearson's life at\nManchester can chiefly be known from the letters that passed between\nthese two friends, which towards the end seem almost to degenerate\ninto a series of begging letters from a poor weaver out of work and\n'thrice dispirited.'  But this at any rate is seen in their\ncorrespondence, that even in abject poverty high thinking is\npossible, and Wordsworth's poems seem to be medicine for the mind;\nwhile on the other hand there is always the ready and generous\nresponse of the yeoman of Winster Vale, and such delicacy in act of\ngift as makes one feel how finely strung, how nobly sensitive was the\nmind of the benefactor.\n\nPearson sends Thomas Smith a copy of _The Excursion_.  'Your tidings\nabout Wordsworth,' says the poor weaver, under date of April 15,\n{128} 1821, 'I will not call him Mr., he is too great for that, were\ngood tidings indeed; his _Excursion_ I have been longing for ever\nsince it was first published, but the price has been an\nunsurmountable obstacle to a weaver.'\n\nThe two friends unbosom their hearts to one another in these letters,\nand there is seen something of the deep religious side of Pearson's\ncharacter in some of them.  'I cannot,' he writes to Smith in 1831,\n'conclude without a word about what you write of your being unhappy.\nRead your Bible.  Trust in that Good Being who gave you your\nexistence.  Consider the many in your situation who from ignorance\nand want of education have not the arguments of hope that you have;\n... only the wicked need be unhappy; at anyrate do not despair.'  And\nagain in 1838, 'I wish I could console you under your troubles.  Be\nthankful you have not a guilty conscience--the greatest of evils.\nRead your Bible, read Wordsworth, Shakespeare and Milton.  Do you go\nto worship, public, I mean?  You have a chapel at the foot of your\nhill, join yourself to them.'\n\nWhen Smith lay dying, Pearson wrote a letter full of tender sympathy.\n'So long as reason and memory remain, I shall never forget {129} the\nmany delightful hours we have passed together, whether in reading\nsome favourite poet or rambling among the beautiful scenes of\nNature.'  'I believe,' he added, 'that seldom have two persons come\ntogether more in sympathy than we two, and I have often felt that my\nseparation from you was one of my greatest losses in leaving your\npart of the country.'\n\nThose rambles he mentions were walking-tours he took in 1817 through\nDerbyshire, and in 1818 in the Craven country of Yorkshire.  He kept\njournals, and full of delightful observation of men and things they\nare, redolent of real joy in sunshine and cloud.  He writes, 'We\nwalked forward on this delightful morning with vigorous steps.  The\nlark was our constant companion, cheering us overhead with her song,\nthe fresh air of the mountains bathed our cheeks, there was freedom\nfrom care and the feeling of liberty\n\n                  'When the fretful stir\n  Unprofitable, and the fever of the world\n  Hung not upon the beatings of our hearts.'\n\n'We felt something,' he adds, 'of\n\n                  \"That blessed mood\n  In which the burden of the mystery,\n{130}\n  In which the heavy and the weary weight\n  Of all this unintelligible world\n  Is lightened: that serene and blessed mood\n  In which the affections gently lead us on.\"\n\n\nAt the end of his Derbyshire journal he says that 'the remembrance of\nthose happy days in Derbyshire will lie in the landscape of his\nmemory, like spots of stationary sunshine; they will be to him and\nhis friend as wells of pure water amid desert sands to which their\nsouls may fly for refreshment hereafter in hours of weariness amid\nthe din of towns and cities and the many shapes of joyless delight.'\n\nDid ever city man take back to city roar and barrenness more quiet\nand more profit from a country ramble?\n\nIn his last letter to Thomas Smith, he spoke of having left the\nManchester neighbourhood.  In the autumn of 1820 he gave up his work\nin the Manchester Bank.  He never could think of his native vale\nwithout a sense of heartsickness; his work was irksome and city life\nhateful.  In his poem to the river Winster dated 1821, he writes:\n\n      'And in the heavy time of after life,\n  When buried in the midst of toil and strife\n  In trading towns, if intermission sweet\n  I sought from my dull toil, my fancy fleet\n{131}\n  Was straight amid thy vernal meads and flowers,\n  Thy hanging fields, wild woods, and leafy bowers.\n  Nor could I think of beauty on this earth,\n  But still 'twas seen with thee--as if thy birth\n  And mine had been together.  Now at ease\n  And free to wander whereso'er I please,\n  What charms I find along thy simple stream,\n  Beloved Winster!'\n\n\nIt is no wonder that a yeoman farmer's son who could thus write,\nshould have felt irresistibly drawn from exile in Manchester to his\nnative vale, and we find him back at the Yews, in correspondence, now\nwith the editor of a county paper, now with Miss Wordsworth, now\nwriting a ballad or a poem, now a natural history note, now wandering\noff down Duddon Vale, and through the Lake District, and now keenly\ninterested in a little dilapidated estate in the Crosthwaite township\ncalled sometimes Borderside, sometimes Balderside, or perhaps more\naccurately in Viking phrase, Bauta-side, and determining to go into\nthe farming line.\n\nHe became purchaser of the Borderside estate in 1822; at once he\ndetermined to let it for five years, and gave his whole time and the\nrent to boot, to the improvement of it.\n\nIn the summer of the same year that he became an estatesman, he\nplanned a tour into Scotland.  Wordsworth wrote him a full and {132}\nparticular itinerary, and William Pearson followed the footsteps of\nthe bard, and really made the same journey as Wordsworth's first\nexcursion to Scotland.\n\nThere is an interesting note of the peasants recollection of Burns in\nAyrshire, and of the Sabbath manners of certain of the Auchterarder\nfolk, but the journal otherwise is a little tiresome.\n\nThe next ten years were spent in the not very profitable work of\nmending the fences and outbuildings of Borderside, and then of\nattempting to make its crops pay the rent and leave something over.\nBut in 1841 he 'declined' farming, not without the secret joy of\ngetting back to his mother's house at the Yews, where all his books\nwere stored, and where the _EncyclopÃ¦dia_, just bound, was awaiting\nhim.\n\nHe had not been idle, he had made the Corn Laws a study, and had\nconcluded that they were unjust, cruel, and impolitic.  He had done\nwhat he could to get the Kendal folk to abolish the old system of\nselling fruit by baskets, or paniers containing sixteen quarts, and\nhad introduced the better system of selling by weight.\n\nIn the spring of 1842 his mother died, and {133} now, at the age of\nsixty-two, William Pearson felt free to marry.  He married Ann\nGreenhow of Heversham in May.\n\nHe was by instinct a tiller of the ground; he used to say that 'no\none felt more dependence upon God than the farmer in his fields.'  He\nturned his attention to fruit culture, planted a large orchard with\n300 trees and two lesser ones, and felt that he had not lived in\nvain.  It was during this period that he began making notes of the\nhabits of the bird and beast life round about him.  Some observations\non the habits of the hedgehog which he sent in 1836 to Mr. Wordsworth\nwere sent by the poet to the members of the Kendal Natural History\nSociety, of which Pearson had been a member almost from the first.\n\nThe result of this communication evoked, so Cornelius Nicholson, the\nthen secretary, tells us, so much enthusiasm, that a class was\ndetermined on for mutual instruction in the habits and distinctive\nfaculties of birds and beasts.  It was Pearson's habit to attend the\nmonthly discussion meeting of this Society, and he thought nothing of\nsetting off after an early tea and walking in nearly seven miles to\nKendal and walking back by starlight after the lecture.\n\n{134}\n\nIt was to this part of his life between the years 1825 and 1833 that\nbelong the glimpses of his intimacy with the Rydal Mount family, as\nshown by the letters, chiefly from Dorothy Wordsworth, that have been\npreserved to us.  It is clear that William Pearson was a most welcome\nguest at Rydal.  Excursions up Helvellyn are planned with the\nWordsworths, and natural history notes are exchanged.  The letters\nare chiefly interesting as giving us hints of the simplicity of the\nlife there, and are often full of thanks to him for a panier of\napples, or a leash of partridges, they contain a request for straw\nfor the stables, they seek his advice in purchase of a pony, they\nsend requisition for more potatoes and the like.  William Pearson was\nlooked upon as the henchman who could be best trusted to supply the\nRydal Mount with farm produce, and it is clear that to do the bidding\nof the bard and be steward of his stable economics was a real\npleasure to him.\n\nHe also sent to Dorothy Wordsworth's sick-room just those delightful\nlittle nature anecdotes which cheered her in her retirement.  He\nadmired and honoured the poet's sister.  'Never,' says he in one of\nhis letters to Smith in 1832, 'have I known a more {135} amiable\nwoman.  Her understanding and judgment are of the highest order.  I\nhave heard Mr. Wordsworth say that he had been more indebted to her\njudgment than to that of any other person.'\n\nThe correspondence gives little facts and dates of household matters\nthat are interesting to students of the poet's life at Rydal.  For\nexample, we learn on May 5, 1830, that on the next day will be\nfinished the new terrace, to the poet's satisfaction; we learn also\nof Wordsworth's constant trouble from 1833 and onward by reason of\nthe inflammation of his eyes.  We hear incidentally how poor a\nhorseman, but how good a walker the poet is, and the simplicities and\nhospitalities of Rydal Mount are brought before us.\n\nBut it was not only as steward of the farm and orchard that Pearson\nwas so truly honoured by the Wordsworths.  It was because the poet\nfelt that in him he had a real lover of his art, and a real\nunderstander of his poetry and his philosophy.  One is not surprised\nto find that Wordsworth thanked him on the occasion when, in the\nKendal paper, the worthy yeoman took up pen in defence of the poet.\nAnd those who years after honoured the dead poet's memory--his {136}\npersonal friends, Dr. Davy and others--were grateful to William\nPearson when, in 1854, he championed, in a letter full of feeling and\nknowledge, the Protestantism of the bard, which had been called in\nquestion by a lecturer of the Protestant Alliance in Kendal, who had\ndescribed Wordsworth's poetry as being 'one of the principal means of\nthe revival of priestly domination in the Church of England.'\n\nIt is very touching to see how really he valued the friendship of the\npoet he so well understood and so honoured.  'What claim have I,' he\nwrote to Dorothy Wordsworth, 'on the notice of a man like your\nbrother?  My chief obligations to him for conferring on me his\nsociety and hospitable notice I hope I shall feel to the latest hours\nof my life.'  Writing to Wordsworth from Borderside under date 1849,\nhe says, 'I felt very grateful for your letter.  On reading the first\nfew lines I was sorry to think how much Mrs. Wordsworth's handwriting\nhad changed, but when I found it was indeed your own hand the tears\ncame into my eyes.  I shall preserve this kind memorial and shall not\npart with it till I part with everything in life.'  These were the\nwords of a real hero-worshipper, and he had cause for hero-worship.\n\n{137}\n\nWhat Wordsworth's poetry did to inspire and keep pure and true and\nserene the heart of William Pearson, it will still do for men of\nhumble country life in the years that are to be.  We need to-day more\nof soul among our farmer folk, we want a _vade mecum_ for the tiller\nof the soil that shall lift his soul to Heaven.  I cannot doubt that\nif men would study Wordsworth and receive his 'heart into their own,'\nthere would be dignity and happiness added to many a daleside home.\n\nTo return to William Pearson.  He found the farm life on the whole a\nhappy one.  He would not have given it up had he not determined to\nmarry.  His orchards prospered, and his hay grass was generally well\ngot.  His frugal ways ensured him competency, and all day and every\nday he was learning more of Nature's secrets, more of the pleasant\nways of birds and beasts about him.  He was making observations, too,\non the changes that had come over the vale of Lythe and the\nneighbouring fells and common lands, since the packhorse had ceased\nto be, and the common enclosures and the larch planters had come in.\n\nBut his ears were open also to the quaint sayings and superstitions,\nand his eyes were on the quaint ways and customs of the dalesmen\n{138} amongst whom he dwelt and moved, and these observations bore\ngood fruit in the paper written in 1841, the year before his\nmarriage, for the Kendal Natural History Society, entitled 'A Sketch\nof some of the Existing and Recent Superstitions of Westmoreland.'\n\nIt was doubtless a source of gratification to William Pearson that\nthe son of the poet should be the officiating minister in Bowness\nChurch the day he led his wife to the altar, in May of 1842.  And he\nmust needs have been pleased on his return to Low House after a\nwedding jaunt through the lakes, to find that Hartley Coleridge, who\nhad called to congratulate him on his marriage, left behind him an\nimpromptu sonnet.  It had, as most of Hartley's sonnets have, a\nlittle touch of description of the life both of himself and of his\nfriend, the gentle estatesman:\n\n  'A little man of solitary life\n    And half an idiot too--more helpless still--\n  Can wish all joy to thee and to thy wife;\n    Thy love must be as constant as thy will.\n  My gentle friend, how happy mayst thou be!\n  Thou hast a wife to pray--and pray with thee.'\n\n\nDuring the coming June of 1842 Pearson took his wife to the\nContinent.  He had long {139} planned this trip; writing to his\nfriend Thomas Smith in April of 1841, to tell him of his intended\nventure on 'that variety of untried being,' marriage, he says that\nMr. Wordsworth has advised him to make a Swiss and Italian tour\nbefore age renders him unfit for foot-travel, and adds that his\nfuture wife 'is an excellent walker, and is quite willing to share\nthe fatigue, and he is sure she will share the pleasure.'  There is a\nnote of simplicity in this intention to see the Swiss and Italian\nlakes afoot--the bridegroom now more than three score years, but a\n'young heart travels many a mile,' and William Pearson's heart was\nyoung to the last.\n\nWordsworth supplied him with an itinerary which he faithfully\nfollowed.  After the tour they stayed on until the spring at Versoix,\nnear Geneva, and his journal shows that he was busy making naturalist\nnotes all the while.  There is a touching note in his journal of his\ndelight on getting back to his Westmoreland home.  The blue mountains\nand the well-known fells, and the ivy-covered cottage of Low House,\nand the happy greetings from beloved friends.  These deeply moved him.\n\nThere was no suitable house for the happy couple in Crosthwaite, and\nafter staying at {140} Low House for the winter, he went into\nlodgings at High Crag.  Lodgings were not William Pearson's ideal of\nhome life, and though he was a man of sixty-seven he determined in\n1847 to build a house on his own estate.\n\nIt was a glad day for him when, as he tells us, on the last day of\nJuly, 1848, he crept into the bosom of his own cheerful cot 'with\nmeasureless content,' a cottage 'unclothed by rough-cast,' as he told\nWordsworth, 'but exhibiting a goodly row of chimneys with pretty\nround tops on square pedestals, the only specimens yet in Crosthwaite\nof the revived good old fashion.'\n\nWe have a poet's description of this Borderside home from the pen of\nPerceval Graves, who, writing from Dovenest in 1862, thus describes\nit:\n\n  'Red roses flush its native stone,\n    The grassy slope, the rocky mount\n  Are gay with flowers,--a shadowy fount\n    Murmurs with cool delicious tone.\n  Beneath, an orchard far and wide\n    Its blossom on its front displays;\n    Across the valley friendly rays\n  From neighbour houses hail Borderside.'\n\n\nHere for the next eight years dwelt the refined and thoughtful\nyeoman, reading such {141} books as he felt he could afford to buy,\nsuch books as he could borrow from Kendal, or were lent him by\nColeridge or Perceval Graves or Wordsworth; corresponding with such\nnaturalists as Waterton and Gough, such students as Perceval Graves\nand Dr. Davy, keeping up constant communion with the friends at Rydal\nMount; getting hold of the best that could be had of the scientific\ntreatises of the day; dipping here and there into theologic problems;\nstudying his Shakespeare and his Milton, enjoying his Carlyle, his\nBurns, and his Scott, his Reed's _English Literature_, impressing,\nwhen he met him, such a man as Sir William Hamilton, examining the\ntheories of Agazziz and Brewster as to moraine and glacier action,\ncomparing his own natural history observations with those of Waterton\nand White of Selborne; and from time to time, when he had returned\nfrom some ride on 'Nep' or 'Camel,' his favourite ponies, sitting\ndown to chronicle the beauty of the day's outing, or the wild life of\nbird and beast he had observed.  Amongst the latter must be noted his\npapers on the partridge and the squirrel, in 1846; on the woodgrouse,\nthat 'new bird' which appears to have come to Colthouse first in the\nautumn of 1845 (this paper was {142} written in 1850), and again on\nthe hagworm, 1852; 'Notes on Characters and Habits of Domestic\nAnimals, 1854'; and 'A few Recent Notices in Natural History, 1855.'\n\nAll Pearson's prose has a dignity and simplicity and directness that\nmakes one realise he had been a reader of the masters of English\nstyle, but it makes one feel also that he is a poet at heart, as he\nwrites his prose.  Take for example his account of the glede or\nkite--alas! long vanished from our land, though nesting at the ferry\nas late as the beginning of last century;--'I have seen,' says he,\n'the glede and his beautiful flight, no words of mine can adequately\ndescribe it.  It was on a windy day in autumn or winter that he\ngenerally made his appearance.  Imagine a bird measuring five feet\nbetween the tips of his wings.  To glide along it required apparently\nno mechanical effort, no fluttering of the wings, not the tremor of a\nfeather.  It was not flying but sailing on the bosom of the air, as\nif by an effort of the will, such ease, such grace, such dignity.'\n\nThe evenings at Borderside were spent in reading.  A mellow musical\nvoice with much feeling in it, would render a passage from some\nfavourite poet, and as often as not the {143} old man's voice would\nfalter and he would say, 'I cannot go on,' and with tears rolling\ndown his cheeks he would put the book down.  Perceval Graves, his\ngreat friend of the later years, would ofttimes come over for high\ndiscourse and heart communion from Dovenest to Borderside.  He\ndescribed those pleasant visits thus:\n\n  'And when our cheerful meal was o'er,\n    A meal which friendship seemed to bless\n    And elegance and homeliness\n  With charm we scarce had known before.\n\n  How swiftly flew the hours away,\n    As thought and feeling deeply stored\n    By mind and heart all forth were poured\n  In loving faith and lively play!'\n\n\nThe summer of 1856 was memorable for a waterspout that fell in\nhay-time on the 8th of August, upon Carnigill, near Borrow Bridge; we\nwho travel by the L.N.W.R. from Tebay to the south can still see the\nwounds upon the mountain side the fury of the torrent made.  The\nphenomenon was minutely described by the old meteorologist in a\nletter to Mr. Davy.  It was the last August he would see.\n\nThe long walks over fell and moor gave way to pony-back, and\npony-back gave way {144} to a carriage.  It was clear to all who knew\nthat delicately chiselled face and noble brow of the yeoman poet and\nnaturalist, that with all his mental powers clear and his eye\nundimmed, his natural strength was abating.  In the spring of 1856\nthe Winster folk noticed that though he visited, as was his wont, all\nthe orchards for miles round, he visited them in his gig, and men\nknew by his constant cough that his old enemy, bronchitis, was\npressing him sore.  But every sunny day found him sitting with his\nbook under the shadow of the famous ash tree at Borderside, and still\nat night time, if the stars were clear, they saw a tall figure\nwrapped in a plaid, and stick in hand, pacing slowly the garden path,\nbefore the door was shut and lights went out.\n\nAs for his own light, that went out, painlessly almost as it seemed,\non December 16th.  A day or two before, he had gone to the window of\nhis sick room, and said, 'In another month the snowdrops will be\nhere.'  The snowdrops came, but alas! for eyes of others almost too\ndim for tears to see them.  On the day of his death, or more\nproperly, his falling on sleep, the sunset brightened in the west,\nand the dying man with the instinct of an observer keen to the last,\nturned his {145} face to the window to see the glory grow.  Then he\nsighed and passed to other glory beyond all sunsetting.\n\nOf his work that remains, little need be said.  It is always\nthoughtful, accurate of observation, pure in style, refined in\ndiction, and delicate in poetic appreciation.  One much regrets that\nhe who had in 1808 espoused the 'Terza Rima' should have so soon\nquitted the sonnet's scanty plot of ground and left so few examples\nof his work.  Amongst the miscellaneous papers and letters on natural\nhistory that remain are three which we of this county cannot be too\nthankful for.  One is a paper 'On certain changes that have taken\nplace of late years in a part of the Lake District,' with its notes\nof 'pack-horse-routes,' 'implements of primitive husbandry,' 'the\nintroduction of larch planting,' 'commons enclosure,' and with its\ninteresting account of the ancient Lythe Marsh.\n\nAnother is a paper in form of six letters to Thomas Gough containing\n'notes on a few subjects in the natural history of Crosthwaite and\nLythe, and the valley of Winster.'  He prefaced this series of\nletters with an apparent quotation which really was his own saying\nand which, as a lover of St. Francis and of {146} all his true\nfollowers, I dare to repeat.--'These lonely denizens of the earth,\nour fellow pilgrims on the journey of life, have their appointed\ntasks as we have, set out by the great Creator.'  There spoke the\nheart of the wise old Winster estatesman, who long had known the bond\nof love that binds the travailing creation into one, who as he moved\namong his brother birds and flowers, and felt the glory of his\nbrother sun, or of his sister the homeside fire, also then\n\n      'With bliss ineffable\n  Could feel the sentiment of Being spread\n  O'er all that moves and all that seemeth still\n  O'er all that leaps and runs and shouts and sings\n  Or beats the gladsome air, or all that glides\n  Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself\n  And mighty depth of waters.'\n\n\nThe last two papers to be mentioned are 'The Sketches of some of the\nexisting and recent Superstitions of Westmoreland': most valuable\nthese are, as written just in the nick of time.  The two generations\nthat have passed since he collected his material and penned his\nnotes, have ceased to hand on the traditional sayings and become too\nmatter of fact to be 'boddered wid sic things as Charms or Boggles or\nDobbies or Barguests or Wisemen or Witches.'\n\n{147}\n\nThere is no one in the county of Westmoreland to-day who would care\nto take their children when plagued with the kink-cough up to\nCartmel-fell, on chance of clipping a hair from the cross on an ass's\nback and then tying it round the bairn's neck as a sovereign remedy\nfor the troublesome whoop.\n\nBut if it had not been for William Pearson I doubt if we should have\nknown that the Winster dalesfolk, notwithstanding that the Cross was\nset here in the clearing so many centuries ago, were actually\nfire-worshippers and carrying on the rites of Baal with their\nBeltane-fires as late as the year of Our Lord 1840.  Pearson tells us\nhe talked with a farmer who had actually been present at the\nsacrifice by fire of a calf in this neighbourhood, and that there\nwere two places within the memory of men then living, Fell Side in\nCrosthwaite and Hodge Hill on Cartmel-fell, where, to prevent the\ndeath of calves after birth, large fires were kindled in the open air\nnear to the farm house and a living calf laid upon them and burnt to\ndeath.\n\nAs for the reality of this superstitious relic of sun-worship, in the\nyear 1840, William Pearson actually witnessed it here in Crosthwaite,\nand, with a quotation from his paper {148} upon this point, I will\nclose this notice of his life and work:\n\n'The Need Fire has again made its appearance.  There is at present a\nrumour of a dreadful epidemic among cattle, which has shown itself in\ndifferent places in this part of our country, to which it has been\ncoming slowly up from the South, where it prevailed last summer.  On\nSunday afternoon, the 15th of last November, returning from Kendal by\nway of Brigsteer, when I reached the brow of the hill that overlooks\nthat pleasant village, and from whence there is a glorious prospect,\nI was somewhat surprised to see, in Crosthwaite, two or three large\nmasses of white smoke \"rising up like the smoke of a furnace.\"  I\nthought it was lime-burning, from some kilns that are not usually\noccupied.  But when I reached Crosthwaite, I found myself in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of one of these \"smokes,\" which was rising\nvery thickly below the Church Tower.  I enquired of a young woman\nstanding in the road what was the meaning of all this smoke.  \"Oh,\"\nsaid she, \"it is the Need Fire.\"  Well, thought I, much as I have\nheard of it, I have never seen the Need Fire.  I will not miss this\nopportunity of having ocular evidence of all its {149} mysteries.  On\nreaching che spot, I found the fire burning in the narrow lane called\nKirk Lane, within about twenty yards of the Kirk Tower, and about\nhalf a dozen cattle huddled together and kept close to the fire, and\namongst the smoke, by a number of men and boys standing on each side\nof them, in that narrow lane.  Sometimes they drove them through the\nfire, and such was the thickness of the smoke that I could scarcely\nperceive the actors in this strange ceremony--men and cattle.  \"So,\"\nsaid I, \"you are giving them a smoke.\"  \"Yes,\" replied the owner of\nthe cows, \"we wish to be like our neighbours.\"  \"But have you got the\nreal Need Fire?\"  \"Yes, we believe so, it came down Crook yesterday.\"\nNow I had heard that it had been at Low Levens a few days before, so\nthat this superstitious fire was evidently moving about in all\ndirections through the length and breadth of the land: nor do they\nappear to give it any rest, even on Sundays!'\n\n\n\n\n{150}\n\nJOSEPH HAWELL, A SKIDDAW SHEPHERD.\n\nDid you know Joseph Hawell of Lonscale?\n\nNearly everybody within sight of Skiddaw did, and knew him to honour\nhim and to speak well of him.\n\nNot a ram-show nor a Herdwick prize show, not a clipping feast nor\nshepherd's meeting, but 'kenned' Joseph Hawell; and of later years\nmost of the 'Yellow' or Conservative meetings in the district had\nseen his manly form and heard his manly words in what he used to call\n'the national cause.'  For Joseph Hawell was a Conservative and a\nUnionist; 'thoro'-bred' he used to say, for his father and his mother\nhad felt as he did in matters political, and he thought 'they had\nmixed a laal bit yaller wid his poddish' when he was a boy.  At any\nrate he would have liked well enough to have branded his fleecy {151}\nSkiddaw darlings with the words 'For King and Country,' and used a\nyellow 'dip' if such had been in existence.\n\nI knew his old father--him of Longlands in Uldale--later of Lonscale;\nand a better informed man, a man, that is, better read in the news of\nthe day, was hardly to be found in the farm-houses round Keswick.  So\nlike Dean Stanley of Westminster he was in face that I would\nintroduce him to my friends as 'the Dean,' and by his side, as he\n'cracked' on the things of state, sat usually one of the\nsweetest-faced, gentlest-natured of women, his good wife, whose\nmaiden name was Jane Walker, of Stockdale.  They had married in the\n'fifties' of last century, and she had borne him five children--John,\nJane (who died in girlhood), Robert, Joseph, and Ann.\n\nJoseph was a Christmas present to the old oak cradle at Longlands\nFarm, for he was born on the 24th December, 1854; and he grew up,\nwith John and Robert, to be as passionately fond of sheep as his\nfather.  Never a boy for books much at school, he still as a\nyoungster was ever fond of helping on the Fell, and of training the\nshepherd's dogs; and rare training he had himself.\n\n{152}\n\nHis father had, from a present of ten gimmer lambs, given him by his\nfather when he was a young man, reared up quite a fine race of the\nblackfaced Herdwicks, and was, by the time the lads could bear him\ncompany, flockmaster of 500 sheep on Frozen Fell and Wylie Ghyll, and\nof 300 in the Forest, as it is called--the great heathery waste in\nthe basin at the back of Skiddaw.\n\nJoseph grew up strong and lusty as a shepherd should grow, and\ntogether with his brothers, took to wrestling as all shepherds in\nCumberland ought to do; but the lads, as they grew up, became so fond\nof the sheep and so devoted to their father, that as soon as he,\nseeing that they were likely to be drawn into the ring, and to lose\nsome of their interest in the Herdwick sheep, begged them to give up\nthe wrestling, they gave it up; and henceforth these brothers' one\naim in life seemed to be how they could most help their father to\nimprove the Herdwick breed, and maintain his honour as a shepherd.\n\nIn 1869 the family migrated from Uldale to the secluded farm on Col.\nWatson's estate, between Lonscale and Saddleback; and what success\nthe Hawells, father and sons, obtained {153} as breeders of pure\nHerdwicks can be seen by any who will call to-day at the Farm, and\nask to be shown the prizes and cards that literally cover the walls\nfrom floor to ceiling.\n\nThe old man, who had struggled with storm on Skiddaw through his\nlaborious life, failed in health, suffered as shepherds often do from\nterrible rheumatism, and was troubled with asthma.  At last he felt\nobliged to leave the ingle-nook and take to his bed upstairs; but his\nlove of the shepherd's life was still so strong upon him that a few\ndays before he died he insisted on seeing one of the prize Herdwick\nrams, and the sons had a tough job to get it to 'clim' the 'stee' and\nstand in the presence of the dying man.  The old man felt death\ncoming upon him shortly after, but he told those who watched they\nneed not trouble to fetch the doctor, as he knew his hour had come,\nand he was ready to 'gang' home.\n\nI wrote this sonnet at the time of his death:\n\n  The sheep are bleating in the fell-side field,\n    The kine call sadly from the homestead near,\n    But thou art far away, thou dost not hear.\n  A greater Shepherd, for thy feet, doth wield\n{154}\n  The rod that thro' the vale of death can yield\n    Sole comfort.  Round thy bed and round thy bier\n    The trophies of thy hand in letters clear,\n  Speak; but we speak not: grief our lips has sealed.\n\n  Farewell, where Glenderaterra pours apace\n    Rich music from her thousand upland springs!\n    Thy name, old friend, the Lonscale streamlet sings;\n  King-Shepherd thou of Skiddaw's fleecy race;\n  And still in memory we behold thy face,\n    Lined by laborious morns and evenings.\n\nAnd on the headstone in Greystoke churchyard, that records Edward\nHawell's burial, may be seen the following lines:\n\n  Here lies a simple shepherd, one who strove\n    To leave behind a fairer, fuller flock;\n  Lead him, Great Master Shepherd, in thy love,\n    To wells of life from the Eternal Rock!\n\n\nBefore he died he had the comfort of seeing Joseph wedded to as good\na daughter-in-law as ever lived.  It was but in keeping with the\nwhole life of the household that Joseph should have first met\nMargaret Roberts at the Gillbanks' clipping.  The love for all time\nthat first began at the shearing, went on smoothly till that other\nMaster of the Shears, one men call Death, cut so cruelly the knot\nthat Love in this life had tied.  Married in 1886, Joseph was happy\nas man could be; he {155} was blessed with a son John, and a daughter\nSarah Jane.\n\nWith plenty of work on the Fells by day for himself, his brother, and\nhis men to do, he yet found time to study at night.  He took to\npolitics as his father before him had taken to them, and, having\ngained confidence in public speaking, he worked hard at his speeches\nand the preparing of them.\n\nOf books he had not many but good; and he specially delighted in\nbiographies and history.  He never tired of reading of the _Spacious\nTimes of Great Elizabeth_, the _History of Wellingtons Wars_, or of\n_Nelson's Exploits_; and when the Royal Jubilee and Armada\nTercentenary came round, no stronger hand or more willing heart was\nfound in the whole neighbourhood to build up the huge bonfire stack\non Skiddaw top than Joseph Hawell's.  As I write I can see him, the\nperspiration streaming down his honest face, building away with the\npeats, and handing up the paraffin, bucket by bucket; and hoping, as\nhe told us then, there was not a man in canny Cumberland but would\nfeel the fiery glow of a patriot's heart that night.\n\nBut he will never help us on Skiddaw top more; and never, alas, shall\nwe go to the {156} shepherds' meeting in Wylie Ghyll with him again,\nor see him at the ram fair, or hear him at a 'yaller' speech day, or\nsit with him at his own fireside and 'crack' on about the Herdwicks.\n\nIt is thought that influenza laid its deadly hand upon him early in\nthe year 1891, and simultaneously he had some ailment of the\ngums--toothache he called it.  It must have been something more\nserious; he went off to Keswick to see the doctor: the doctor lanced\nthe gum, but the wound took bad ways, and within a day or so the\nstrong man was in bed, weak and delirious.\n\nHe wished to be up and after the sheep.  Must be about his father's\nbusiness!  And, on a cold Spring day, Friday, February 20th, an angel\ncame to the lonely farmstead of Lonscale, to bid the brave man's\nspirit fare the way that all who really wish to do that Heavenly\nFather's business must go uncomplainingly.  And still Joseph Hawell's\nheart was where it had ever been--at home in England.  He thought\nthat some strange hands were taking him away by force to another\nland, and the last words that he spoke were these:\n\n'No! if I must die, I will at least die an {157} Englishman on\nEnglish ground!'  And so he died.\n\nThe strong hand of one stronger than man had taken him; and in a few\ndays more, on February 23rd, hands tender and strong, the hands of an\naffectionate brother and true friends, bore the body of a shepherd,\ndead in his prime--for he was but 36 years old--down through the\ncow-pasture and over the gurgling Glenderaterra, and so through the\nsilent Brundholme woods above the wailing Greta away to its rest in\nEnglish earth beneath the shadow of the old church of St. Kentigern,\nin the Crosthwaite valley, within sight of that horned hill of\nSkiddaw he had loved so well.  The people of Keswick begged that his\nbody might be carried through their sorrowful town that opportunity\nmight be given of showing sympathy and respect.  And many a stalwart\nyeoman came to the Homegoing.  Little they said, but they felt much\nas they moved in their dark market-carts toward the burial.\n\n'Eh, but what! it's a terrible loss for us all!'  'The best man amang\nus gone.'  'We all mun ga when t' time comes, but it's hard bearing\nis this.'  'Niver a handier man wi' {158} t' sheep i' t' whoale\nforest.'  'Niver a better man clim't t' fell; a decent, stiddy man as\niver was; niver heard a wrang word from him.'  'Eh, but! it's past\nfinding out t' way young uns goes, and auld ones stays.'  'Poor lass,\nshe's lost as good a mate as ever woman had.'  'Poor barns, they've\nlost a fadder afore they kent him.'  And so sorrowfully they turned\naway from the grave, whereon flowers had been strewn and wreaths laid\nby hands of men who in their common regret forgot all party\ndifferences and thought only of Joseph Hawell, as a man the 'Blues\nand Yellows' were alike proud of in life, and alike determined to\nhonour in death.\n\nI was a traveller in foreign lands when the news of Joseph Hawell's\ndeath reached me, and I felt for a moment stunned.  As I realised it,\nit seemed to me as if I did not care to see Skiddaw again.  He was a\npiece of it; and Skiddaw without him would be no Skiddaw at all, such\nan ideal yeoman shepherd; so tender-hearted to the yeanlings; so true\nto his mountain flock; such a man among men, honest and upright,\nreliable; one always knew somehow that if Joe was present, men right\nand left of him would {159} behave like gentlemen; so high-minded and\nbent on the 'Just and True'; and, 'as the great ones only are, in his\nsimplicity sublime.'  His influence was wider and deeper than he had\ndreamed of, and I felt that with Joe Hawell a power that had worked\nfor righteousness in a whole fell-side community, had passed as far\nas visible form goes from the earth.\n\nOn reaching home, it was with a sad heart that I neared the solitary\nfell-side farm that had been so darkened with loss.  There was the\nsame kitchen; the fiddle was on the wall; the bacon flitches hung\nfrom the rafter; the stuffed heads of the two old favourite shepherd\ndogs, 'Dainty' and 'Rob,' looked out from under the triumphal arch of\nsickles from the wall; the gun rested close by; the medicine horn and\nlambing bottle were in their places, and the old row of books that\nthe father and he had so often turned to for thought and inspiration,\nwere in their shelf--but there was no Joe!  Robert took me by the\nhand and bade me sit on the settle, and he would tell me all about\nit.  The poor wife said nothing, but just rose quietly and began to\nspread the table and set on tea, and when I urged that I would not\nhave her fash {160} herself so or put herself out of the way for me,\nshe urged that it would have been Joe's wish, and I said no more.\n\nThen the dogs came in.  'Ah,' said Robert, 't' rough un, \"Jess,\" has\nnot forgitten her master yet.  She was sair put out o' t' way when my\nbrother lay ill, whined at nights and would not be comforted; and she\nhas only just now, after ten weeks' coaxing, consented to follow me\nwhen I go to the Fell.'\n\n[Illustration: JOSEPH HAWELL.]\n\n'And did you have no thought of Joseph's worsening,' I said, 'when he\ntook ill?'\n\n'No,' said Robert, 'but rather a strange thing happened just a week\nbefore.  I am not superstitious, and I said little about it.  But I\nwoke early just as it was beginning to be dawn and saw a sad face\nlooking upon me.  I knew the face well, it was Joe's wife's sister,\nand I thought I was dreaming and sat up, and the face still looked\nvery sadly and then faded away, and I felt it must be a vision.  I\nhave wondered since if it was meant as a token to us.  She was the\nfirst person, however, that came to help us when Joe died.  It is\nsingular, is it not?  Eh dear! but it's a sair heart that I have as I\ngo shepherding now; for it's when I'm amang {161} t' sheep I mostly\nwhat seem to miss him.  It comes ower me t' warst when I am looking\nat t' ewes that we used to talk ower together.  You would like to see\nsome of the letters, I daresay, we received when poor Joe went.'  And\nsaying this, the stalwart man, who loved his brother as tenderly as a\nwoman, put a bundle of letters into my hand.\n\n'But,' said I, as I gave back these precious documents to the owner,\n'did he not leave any papers behind him?  He is spoken of in one\nletter as gifted beyond ordinary measure as a public speaker.'\n\n'Well,' replied the brother, 'he left very little in writing; but you\nknow we kept his speeches.  They are scattered up and down the\nnewspapers.'  And following into the Herdwick-prize room, I soon\nfound myself deep in the speeches Joseph Hawell had from time to time\ndelivered in the political cause he championed.\n\nI asked if he took much trouble in the preparing of his speeches, and\nI was told that he did; worked hard for nights beforehand, and\nsometimes, as our greater orators have done, learned a bit of his\nintended speech by heart.  Joseph had as library, up there in the\nrafter-smoke, some old 17th and {162} 18th century tomes, full of the\nbreath of English spoken pure.  English history was his chief study;\nbut 'here,' said the good wife sadly, 'is a book he oft read in,\nparticularly on Sunday afternoons.'  It was a magnificent folio copy\nof _The Whole Duty of Man_, _The Gentleman's Calling_, _The Art of\nContentment_, and _The Christian Birthright_, printed by Norton, at\nOxford, in 1695.  As I turned over its well-thumbed pages I thought\nthat Joseph Hawell had gone to good models for his masterful English,\nand had drunk wholesome draughts of goodly thought and wisdom as he\nstudied.\n\n'Did he leave no other written papers?'\n\n'Yes, he left a few songs he wrote from time to time.'\n\nI asked to see them.  'God Save Ireland from Disunion,' was the title\nof one; another, in rough copy, was a sheep-shearing song.\n\nHad Joseph written anything else?  Yes; there was just one letter or\ntwo he had left behind him in rough copy, and I was welcome to see\nthem if I cared.  I did care; and was rewarded.\n\nHe had latterly been a bit troubled in his mind by a friend who had\nwhat are called 'free-thinking notions.'  And Joe, who was {163} as\ndead against that kind of cant as any religious cant--and he was, as\nI can testify, hard upon this latter--had delivered his soul.\n\nThe letter was written on February 9th, 1891, and the hand that wrote\nit was cold and stiff on February 20th.  I dare to look upon this\nletter as the yeoman shepherd's last will and testament.  It runs as\nfollows:\n\n'DEAR FRIEND,--I have received your books, and am much obliged.  I\nhave not yet got them read thoroughly, but so far they have but\ncaused a reaction in my mind in favour of the Christian religion, and\nled me to have recourse to some fine old books written more than a\nhundred years ago, in a bold and intelligent hand, proving that\nastronomy and science are a powerful proof of the might and majesty\nof an Almighty Creator.\n\n'Could you follow up your science by winging your way to the highest\nstar of observation, you would there see other skies expanded and\nother planets and systems established, each giving harmony and\nperfection of attention to time by the nicest rule.  Then wend your\nway past other ten thousand worlds, and at the end of this vast tour\nyou would still be muddling in the suburbs of creation, only to find\nthat no imagination can {164} fix the limits of His creating hand,\nand that conceited, ignorant, and insignificant man is absolutely\nunable to comprehend the grandeur and correctness of His magnificent\nworkmanship.  Then am I to be told that the builder of this\nstupendous structure is incapable of such a paltry performance as\ntaking possession of our souls and restoring our lifeless bodies at\nHis own good will and pleasure?\n\n'I find,' he adds, 'Carlyle's work very instructive, and many of the\npassages furnish evidence of the existence of the great Disposer of\nall events.'\n\nI said this should stand as Joseph Hawell's last will and testament.\nNo; there was another letter, written evidently just at the end of\nlast year, in which he begs of a neighbour the loan of a horse and\ngear to enable him to bring down on a sledge from Lonscale Crag one\nof the finest single stones there.  He wishes to set it up in some\nfield on the farm, and have his father's name upon it and his\nfather's deeds and prowess as a breeder of Herdwick sheep, with a\nsingle verse of descriptive poetry beneath, and he feels sure that\nhis friend will lend a hand 'to erect a monument to at least one\nmember of the Hawell family whose stainless, honourable, {165} and\nstraightforward life will always be pointed to with pride by his\ndescendants.'\n\nJoseph Hawell! the horses have gone, and the sledge has brought its\nheavy burden to the home-farm; and on it are engraved two names\ninstead of one, for there are those who honour the son who would so\nhave honoured his sire.  There by that mountain path they both of\nthem knew so well of old is the grey memorial cross set, and on it is\ncarved, in symbol of eternity, the endless knot their Norse\nforefathers used.  A simple verse is engraved at the base.\n\nThose who pass the 'gale' for the meadows of Lonscale, to breast the\nback of Blencathra, or to climb the slopes of Skiddaw, shall surely\nlearn that our Cumberland mountains still as of old breed men of high\npurpose and noble endeavour; and that still, from following the\nsheep, God calls His chosen ones by lives of kindliness, simplicity,\nand straightforward goodness, to guide their brothers in the path of\nduty, righteousness, and truth.\n\n\n\n\n{166}\n\nA FAMOUS YEW-TREE.\n\nThere is a passage in George Fox's _Journal_ that brings one face to\nface with a brave man of God, reveals the spirit of true martyrdom,\nand makes one envious of his dazzling courage:\n\n'Now were great threatenings given forth in Cumberland that if ever I\ncame there again they would take away my life.  When I heard it, I\nwas drawn to go to Cumberland, and went to the same parish whence\nthese threatenings came, but they had not power to touch me.'\n\nIt is a passage that attracts one to the apostle of the\nleathern-apron, and makes one desire to know the scenes of his life's\ntravail.  It was not to be wondered at, therefore, that when one\nfound oneself at Keswick in a neighbouring valley to Lorton, one\nshould wish to visit one of the places ever associated with his\nmemory, and see the spot whence {167} the echoes of the preacher's\nvoice have never died.\n\nAssociated with this wish to follow the footsteps of George Fox, was\nthe desire to see the Yew-tree, 'Pride of Lorton Vale,' which, on the\nday of Fox's sermon, provided seats for the listeners.  For the\nfamous yew-trees in the Lake District are becoming each year fewer.\nIt is true that the great yew in Tilberthwaite is still standing, but\nthat famous hollow trunk that kept alive the name of the mission\npreacher St. Patrick, in Patrick's Dale or Patterdale, has fallen;\nand the great winter storm of 1883 worked havoc upon Seathwaite's\nsacred brotherhood:\n\n        'Those fraternal four of Borrowdale,\n  Joined in one solemn and capacious grove;\n  Huge trunks!--and each particular trunk a growth\n  Of intertwisted fibres serpentine\n  Up-coiling and inveterately convolved--\n\nare now a wreck,--one fell, the others were riven to pieces.\n\nHere in the Lake District, by command of bluff King Hal, each\nestatesman was obliged to plant a yew-tree by his homestead, in order\nthat he might never lack of wood for his bow when he was called--as\nhe not unfrequently was called--to the Marches, in defence of the\n{168} Border.  And in many places, long after the homestead has\npassed away, the solitary yew survives to tell us of the troublous\ntimes of old.  It was not long since an estatesman sent down to the\nlocal museum of Keswick the old oaken bow-chest of his fathers,\nwhich, though it has been long used as a meal-ark, by its carving\nclearly shows it was intended for other use.  The family name of\nBowman is a common one in Cumberland, and still in our neighbourhood\nthe field-names preserve a memory of the village bowman's prowess,\nand the 'butts' field is a word of common parlance.\n\nBut it is George Fox, the man of peace, that we were most interested\nin, as we crossed the Keswick Valley and climbed the long slope of\nWhinlatter to pay a visit to the brave man's preaching place, and it\nwas mere coincidence that that preaching place should be associated\nwith weapons of war.\n\n[Illustration: THE LORTON YEW.]\n\nPeople do not realise how fair a view of the whole Skiddaw range is\npresented to them as they climb that pass, or they would climb it\noftener.  The higher one climbs, the higher does Skiddaw appear, and\ndeep-bosomed mountain-side in all its massy grandeur of emerald green\nand lilac shade in spring, of puce and burnished bronze in autumn,\n{169} impresses one with its calm and restfulness.  The cloud, sure\nsign of fine weather, rests upon its utmost peak to-day, and\nirresistibly recalls the lines of Wordsworth's sonnet:\n\n  'Veiling itself in mid-Atlantic clouds\n  To pour forth streams more sweet than Castaly,'\n\nwhile the pleasant farms with the far-off interchange of happy\ncock-crowing, glitter at our feet, and, like an arm of some great\nocean-loch, the white waters of Bassenthwaite come round the\nprecipice of Barf, and sweep out of the shadow of Wythop woods into\nthe September sunshine.  On our left rises Grasmoor, haunt of the\ndottrel, and Hobcarton Crag, beloved of rare mountain flowers.  So we\ncrest the long slope and drop down into Lorton, with the hill-sides\non our right, golden with gorse against the westering sun.  Turning\nsharply to the left as soon as the village is reached, we pass a kind\nof pleasant rural street, if that may be called a street which has\nhouses only on the one side of it, and just as we emerge into the\ncountry again, find ourself at a spot where the road forks, a portion\nof it going over a beck bridge into a farm enclosure by a picturesque\nold water-mill and byre, and a portion of it,--the main road {170} to\nLoweswater,--bending sharply to the right to go across the valley by\nthe north side of the stream, which is here hidden from view by a\nlong barn building.  If we pause at this point we cannot help being\nstruck by the sombre mass of a great yew-tree standing in a pleasant\nmeadow close to the beck, where at one time there was doubtless a\nford.  This is what Wordsworth described as\n\n        'A yew-tree, Pride of Lorton Vale,\n  Which to this day stands single, in the midst\n  Of its own darkness, as it stood of yore,\n  Not loth to furnish weapons for the bands\n  Of Umfraville or Percy ere they marched\n  To Scotland's heaths; or those that crossed the sea\n  And drew their sounding bows at Azincour,\n  Perhaps at earlier Crecy, or Poictiers.\n  Of vast circumference and gloom profound\n  This solitary tree!--a living thing\n  Produced too slowly ever to decay;\n  Of form and aspect too magnificent\n  To be destroyed.'\n\n\nIt is not to-day the noble tree it was when Fox was here, and the\nprophecy of the poet was only a few years since like to have been\nmade utterly vain.  For its form and aspect was so magnificent that\nits owner sold it to a Lorton wood merchant, and it was just about to\nbe cut down when some memory of Fox's {171} sermon awoke in the\nbreast of a faithful member of the Society of Friends in the\nneighbourhood, and the wood merchant good-naturedly went off his\nbargain.\n\nIt is true that it shows no signs of decay, but it has suffered loss.\nTwo of its main stems were shattered years ago by a hurricane, and\nwere sawn off at the bole.  Let us go along the road to the farm\nbuildings, and turn back down to what now serves for a watering-place\nfor horses.  It is thus we shall best get an idea of how 'it stands\nsingle, in the midst of its own darkness.'\n\nThe branches stretch their shadow over the stream, and the ripple of\nthe sunny talkative beck contrasts strangely with the deep silence of\nthe solemn tree.  If we go up to Whinfell Hall and ask a keen\nobserver of nature and plant life about this famous yew, Mr. Wilson\nRobinson will tell us that he once measured the trunk at its least\ncircumference and found it 23 feet 10 inches, and that, about thirty\nyears ago, a strong south-east gale came with hurricane force down\nHope Ghyll, wrenched off one of the side limbs and carried away a\nthird of the tree.  Another limb has fallen since then, and yet,\nshattered and torn, what a magnificent ruin it {172} is, how well\nworth climbing over Whinlatter Pass to visit.\n\nAfter gazing up the beck towards the picturesque bridge from which we\nfirst surveyed the yew, towards the grand old farmstead and its\ncluster of sycamores as a background for the bridge, let us go back\nto the bridge and across into the meadow wherein the 'Pride of Lorton\nVale' stands, and, gazing from under the tree towards the west and\nsouth, let us wonder at the beauty of faintly bronzed fern on\nWhiteside, the amethystine lilac of the Grasmoor mass, the far-off\ncones of Red Pike and High Stile blue above Mellbreak, and far to the\nwest, Herdhouse ghostly grey; all seeming to join in shutting out the\nworld and making the quiet emerald meadow in which we stand a\nsanctuary for thought and restfulness.\n\nThen let us go back to that day in the year 1653 when George Fox,\nhaving narrowly escaped death by a boy's rapier thrust, and with his\nhand and wrist still smarting from the cruel blow of a rough fellow\ndown at Bootle, where they mobbed him on the previous Sunday, pale\nand worn came hither to the ford and found already James Lancaster,\none of his disciples, who had gone forward {173} as an avant-courier\non the way to Cockermouth, busy haranguing the people.\n\nThe quiet meadow of to-day was on that day full of armed men.  A\ndetachment of Cromwell's soldiers had been told off from Cockermouth\nto keep the peace--it being known that Fox was on his way to Lorton;\nand Mr. Larkham, the Congregationalist minister of Cockermouth, and\nPriest Wilkinson, the Vicar of Brigham-cum-Mosser-cum-Lorton, were\nprobably among the crowd that covered the field and stood by the\nbanks of the stream.  'The people,' we read in Fox's _Journal_, 'lay\nup and down in the open, like people at a leaguer.'  Fox had seen\nsomething of camp life during the late civil war, and he doubtless\nfelt that day that, man of peace though he was, the field of the\nLorton yew would be indeed a field of battle for him.\n\nBut what interests us most as we gaze upon this venerable tree to-day\nin these pleasant pastures beside the waters of peace, is not so much\nthe memory of the crowd of Cromwellian soldiers and members of the\nChurch militant who came out that day to 'sorely withstand' George\nFox, as the vision of the boughs of this sable and majestic yew-tree\n{174} filled with the listening ears and eager eyes of those who\nheard that day the weary and way-worn prophet of the Lord, 'largely\ndeclare the word of Life' as he knew it, and 'open the everlasting\nGospel to them.'  Fox tells us that 'this tree was so full of people\nthat I feared they would break it down.'\n\nLook at it now, and think of it no longer as a broken yew-tree, sown\nhere perchance by some far wandering bird centuries ago, but as a\nliving witness to the power of men who have a living Gospel to\ndeclare to win the souls of their fellows, and lead them into\ncommunion with God who is a spirit.  Men once heard the voice of Fox\nsound out here, above the babble of the beck and the hum of the\nmultitude and the protests of the Lorton minister, and those who\ncrowded on the yew-tree boughs felt light instead of darkness--sun\ninstead of shadow, was their portion, and we read, 'Many hundreds\nwere convinced that day, and received the Lord Jesus Christ and His\nfree teaching with gladness.'\n\nWe are not Quakers, but at least our hearts beat in unison with the\nearnest teacher of the Truth he knew, to an age that {175} was helped\nand is still helped by that Truth; and as we leave the field of the\ntree,\n\n  'Not loth to furnish weapons for the bands\n  Of Umfraville or Percy ere they marched\n  To Scotland's heaths; or those that crossed the sea\n  And drew their sounding bows at Azincour,'\n\nwe rejoice to think that beneath its sable boughs, the preacher of\nthe way of peace as better than war, once preached a sermon; and we\ntrust, that for many a long year still, 'single in the midst of its\nown darkness as it stood of yore,' may stand the Lorton Yew.\n\n\n\n\n{176}\n\nLODORE AFTER STORM.\n\nFive days of continual tempest and five nights of storm-wind from the\nAtlantic had tried the nerves and tempers and tested the sleeping\npowers of all in the Keswick Vale.  Nothing like wind to set folks\n'fratching'; and that anybody was still on speaking terms with his\nneighbour argued well for the kindliness of the townsmen and\nvillagers.\n\nAt last it would seem as if the wind had blown itself out, and at six\no'clock of a grey February evening silence and calm fell upon the\nsodden, weary vale.  But an ominous cloud-pack boiled up over the\nwestern hills, and the barometer went down two inches.  The cattle\nwere scarcely 'suppered up' for the night in the farmsteads and the\nshopmen had scarcely clanged down their last shutter, when the wind\nagain awoke, and the hills thundered and the trees groaned, and we\n{177} knew that America had sent us another cyclone.  The\nhail-showers thrashed the panes, the windows rattled, the chimneys\nmoaned and sighed, and though tired men and women went to bed, it was\nonly to feel their house-walls shake as if an earthquake shock were\npassing underneath, and only to wonder which would be the first\nchimney-stack to fall.  The wind grew to a hurricane, and people as\nthey lay in sleepless fear upon their beds heard strange voices in\nthe storm--cries of sailors in agony upon a bitter shore or perishing\nin the deep.  Then the wind would be heard to try all round the house\nand see if perchance a window-frame would give an entrance and indoor\nhavoc be possible; or a slate would whirl up with a crack and come\ndown clattering on the roof and spin off into the darkness.\n\nThe dawn broke dimly, and the pastures of the middle vale lay like a\nwan sea with isles of emerald.  Broken boughs hung gaunt and creaking\nupon the nearest trees, and the Irish yews curtsied and danced and\nsplit themselves into a hundred spires of nodding darkness against\nthe angry sky.  But the hurricane, however much it might make man\ncower and fear, had no power upon the thrush, {178} who saw, behind\nthe hurricane light of cheerless morn, the dawn of springtide and\nlove and calm.  No storm could\n\n  'Quell or disconcert her golden tongue,'\n\nand there, while the wind fluffed her breast to twice its size, she\nfluted from the swaying holly tree her old familiar call to the slow\nto 'be quick! be quick!' to the drowsy, to 'pray, get up! get up!'\nand then to the sad to 'cheer up now! cheer up! cheer up!'\n\nI answered her challenge and arose.  The lake from end to end was\nridded with foam, and great clouds of water, torn from the surface,\nwere marching from west to east.  Borrodale was black with storm.\nThere was no snow on Skiddaw, though the sleet had in a night turned\nits fine old head grizzled grey, but over Grasmoor and over Grisedale\nit seemed as if some huge ocean wave had broken and left its froth\nbehind it.\n\nNearer, however, than on Grasmoor and on Grisedale there was snow.\nFar down beyond the purpling 'Walla' woodland, lay, in a crevice of\nthe hills between Gowder Crag and Shepherd's Crag, a mighty drift of\nseeming winter whiteness.  That was no gift of winter; it was the\ngift of the past night's {179} rain.  Gazing at it through a good\nfield-glass one could see that the white drift was a falling torrent,\nand as one gazed one almost, in fancy, heard\n\n                          'the roar\n  That stuns the tremulous cliffs of high Lodore.'\n\nI knew that they only can see Lodore aright who will brave storm and\ntempest, for so swiftly does this splendid cataract pour itself away\nthat an hour after the rains have ceased upon the Watendlath fells it\ndwindles to its natural size, loses its milk-white charm, and ceases\nto summon the wanderer to its presence.  But this morning its spell\nwas potent to touch all hearts, and that white winter wreath of snow\nand sound called us from far away.  Down by the old monks' path we\nwent, that the hoofs of sumpter-mules in the Middle Ages had worn\ndeep into the soft soil;--it was to-day a torrent-bed of bubbling\nwater.  On by the village school, where, instead of the pattering of\nchildren's clogs upon the doorstep, to-day the Greta's water gushed\nand fell in miniature cascade.  Over the bridge beneath Greta Hall,\non which the pencil-makers hung in enforced idleness, for there was\ntoo much water to allow the use of the millwheel.  'Brig is pinched\nto be {180} large eneuf for t' watter to-day,' they cried; and so to\nthe town.  'Dar bon! but thoo bed better keep to lee-side oop\nstreet---slates is fleein' same as leaves i' winter,' said an old\nfriend as he passed me.  'Well, Betty, what such a night have you\nhad?' I said to another old friend at the street corner.  'Loavins\nme!' she answered, 'but it's been a capper.  Cwoal cart was lifted up\nand clean turned ower befoar my eyes in oor back yard; and I've been\nup and dressed sin five this morn.  What I thowt wi' mysel if\nanything's goin' to happen, it 'ull not dea fur us _all_ to be naked,\nand sea I got intil my cleas!'\n\nSo up the main street--powdered with broken slates and plaster from\nthe house fronts, and out into the Borrodale road we went.  Trees\nwere laid by their heels at the church gate, the holly berries\ngleamed in thousands by the roadside; the wind had done what in this\nopen winter the birds had failed to do.  Thence on to the Great Wood.\nFine spruces lay across the road, and the roadmen and woodcutters\nwere busy making passage possible for the cart traffic.  Such a scent\nof Christmas trees they made as they hewed away at the spruce\nbranches {181} one felt oneself a child again, and so with a child's\nheart forward.  All through the purple woodland were white patches in\ntop-most boughs, the wounds that the fierce wind had given them.\nOnly one thing the tempest had been powerless to touch; these were\nthe tender lichens and the velvet mosses on trunk and wall.  How they\ngleamed and shone in the forest twilight!  And whilst the boughs\nclashed and the wood was filled with groans and shrieks and cries,\nthere, by the wall and on the ground and on the tree-stems, in quiet\nrestfulness and silent beauty the fearless mosses grew.\n\nBut this was not all the gentle life that seemed to fear no storm,\nfor quavering along from bough to bough a school of long-tailed\ntitmice went in unalarmed pleasure.  The wind that shook the oak\nseemed unable to touch them, and down beside me the tiny wren played\nhis old happy game of hide-and-seek, as if, instead of being lashed\nby a cyclone, the woods were still as eventide in June.\n\nCat Ghyll, beloved of Southey, roared at us as we passed, and one\nheard the wind like a trumpet blowing from the steep of Falcon Crag.\n\nNow clear view was gained of Derwentwater, and one noted that the\nlake lay in long {182} patches of many colours, here bright green,\nthere slate blue, there brown, here white and wan, but ridged\nthroughout with foam; and suddenly, as if it sprang upward from\nhidden depths, a water wraith would leap to sight and other spirits\nwould join it, and the whole silver company of ghostlike vaporous\nforms would come dancing across from the further shore and lose\nthemselves in cloud-like dust upon the land.  Or here again would\nrise a tiny waterspout and spin and spin the water up into mid-air,\nthen march and counter-march, lie down, and rise again.  While all\nthe time upon the shore beneath the roadway, waves broke and surge\ntumbled, with moaning of a troubled sea that might not rest.  It was\nsomething in such a whirl of sound and hissing of such restless\nwaters to feel far up on the other hand, above the russet grey-green\ndraperies and the lilac shales, the calm of the storm-proof citadel\nof Falcon Crag.  We gained Barrow, and heard the waterfall bellowing\nin the wood; but it was Lodore that we had set out to see, and Lodore\nshone white and clear upon its steep only half-a-mile away.\n\nFull sight of Lodore had now been gained, but not before two other\ncataracts flashing to one channel from Gowder Crag had claimed {183}\nour wonder, while we watched the water fall, as it seemed, out of\nheaven, down by the silver birches, down by the silver shale, and\nturn both to darkness by its white contrast.  But what a magnificent\nrose-red glow those birch trees showed, and how with auburn glory the\nlarches gleamed! how too in silken grey and delicate yellow the ash\ntrees climbed the crags!  We went forward, but not till we had noted\nthat, while all the world towards Grange seemed one great grey\nwater-flood, here right in front of the purple-brown cliff in whose\ncleft lay the white Lodore, stood up a little meadowy hill of verdure\ngreen as May--the first home-field of the wandering Viking who pushed\nhis long ship ashore at Ravenglass and made his way over the Styhead\nPass to ancient Borrodale.  For in this green field still flows the\nspring where Ketel the Viking, who afterwards gave his name to the\nWyke which we call Keswick to-day, drank in the olden time.  Ketel's\nWell, as we gaze upon that emerald mound, takes us back to the ninth\ncentury and the first coming of the Norsemen to our dales; and what\nwas it that bade the hardy Norse rover choose to pitch his camp by\nthe spring on yonder hill but that same glorious cataract of Lodore,\nwhose {184} gleaming waters and whose voice of thunder speaks to our\nheart as it one time spoke to his.  Nay, for that weary wanderer over\nsea, Lodore spoke sweeter things.  As he listened to the torrent's\nvoice, there came back memories of his own home-land and all the\nsound and sight of those fair 'fosses' and those shining 'ghylls'\nfrom which he was an outlawed exile.\n\n[Illustration: LODORE AFTER A STORM.]\n\nWe pass on beyond the hollies, beyond the amber reed-bed, beyond the\ngrey copse, and gain the gate to the Fall.  We cross the meadow and\nenter the wood and stand upon the little platform whence the Fall in\nits fulness may be seen.  What strikes one at once is the majesty of\nthe high-towering crag of Gowder to the left of Lodore.  What strikes\none next, is the feeling of a certain lack of height in the fall.  It\ndoes not come rushing over a sheer precipice; it is not cloud-born;\none seems to know that somewhere not far off a valley stream is\npassing along through quiet meadows and woodland, and something of\nthe fierce wildness of its fall is curbed and tamed by the thought.\nYet as we gaze to-day so white is the heaven in the rift between the\ncliffs whence it surges into sight, that a very little imagination\nenables us to feel as if the whole of that white interspace were\nfoam, and {185} one's heart is stirred.  Not in a rift, but from the\ntopmost height we think we see and hear a visionary cataract fall and\nfall.\n\nUp now through broken boulders, wet with perpetual mist, slippery\nwith sodden leaf of russet gold, up till a double wych elm, or two\nelms bound in sisterly embrace--as if they had in fear clutched one\nanother as they stood in awe upon the torrent's brink, is gained;\nthere in shelter of a huge rock, emerald-coated, silver-shining with\nthe spray, we shelter from the drenching water-dust and see another\nview of glorious Lodore.  See and hear, for while the milk-white\nwaters flash and swirl around the ebon boulders in mid-fall, we hear\nthe tall upstanding cliffs make echo to their voice--such sound as he\nwho hears can never quite forget.  We climb again up by a slippery\npath only fit for a goat's foot, helped by impending branches, helped\nmore by the thought that yonder one will gain not only the noblest\nview of the waterfall, but a far outlook over the wide-watered vale\nto grey-blue western hills, beyond which booms the sea that gave us,\non the wings of the wind, all this majesty of sound and motion.\n\nIn this hurricane, the salt of that ocean is on one's lips, and if\nits actual murmurs and {186} the 'scents of the infinite sea' are\ndenied us, at least by proxy they are ours.  For as we slowly win our\nway upward the scent of Lodore fills the air, even as its sound fills\nour ears.  Not the kind of paper-mill scent one knows so well within\nthe locks or by the backwaters of the Thames, but scent born of\nmountain springs and fellside tarns and peaty meadows--scents as\ndelicate as they are subtle.\n\nWe have gained our vantage point for sight and sound.  The huge rocks\nappear like leviathans bobbing their noses through the foam.  A tree\ntrunk has fallen, and seems to have been caught and held by the mouth\nof some vast hippopotamus, who rejoices as the torrent dashes over\nhis vast back.  And the sound is not of bellowing behemoth or\nsnorting river-horse.  No; but such sound as seems to bring all\nworlds to unison.  Shut your eyes, lean, and listen; you may hear a\nmighty army tramping by, you may hear the clashing of innumerable\nbells, you may hear the blare of trumpets, you may hear the shouting\nof a festal multitude, and ever beneath the deepest harmonies the\ntattoo of the thundering river-god, the drum-drum-drumming of Lodore.\n\nOne cannot wonder that hither in 1802 {187} came Charles Lamb, the\nlover of the city's roar, to listen and rejoice.  Keats, too, in 1816\ncame hither and went, as Lamb went back, a sadder and a wetter man;\nbut it is of Southey and his two children, his Edith May and his\ndarling Herbert, we think to-day--he who in the autumn of 1809 heard\nthe same stream saying the same things it says to us to-day, and who\nwriting to his brother Tom on board the _Dreadnought_ under date\nOctober 18, 1809, said:\n\n'I hope you will approve of a description of the water of Lodore made\noriginally for Edith and greatly admired by Herbert.  In my mind it\nsurpasses any that the tourists have yet printed.  Thus it runs:\n\"Tell the people how the water comes down at Lodore?  Why, it comes\nthundering and floundering, and thumping and bumping, and jumping,\nand hissing and whizzing, and dripping and skipping, and grumbling\nand rumbling and tumbling and falling and brawling, and dashing and\nclashing and splashing and pouring and roaring, and whirling and\ncurling, and leaping and creeping, and sounding and bounding, and\nchattering and clattering with a dreadful uproar--and that way the\nwater comes down at Lodore.\"'\n\n{188}\n\nWe turned for home; a patch of blue sky shone momentarily above the\npurple hollow of sound and foam.  And though still 'the forest\ncracked, the waters curled,' a sunbeam showered radiance as it flew\nby moaning woodland and by silent crag.  In the Great Wood all\ncolours of purple, amber, rose, and amethyst leapt out at the passing\nof that gleam.  One could not but compare the marvellous and\nchangeful effects of light and colour to those that, in some\nenchanted land of mystery, the coloured fires of the wizard of the\npantomime call forth, for our children's amazement.\n\nNow all near was dark, while far ahead the witchery of the golden\nwoodland grew.  Now Walla Crag stood purple grey, now shone in lucent\nsilver powdered with larch-tree gold, whilst ever on beyond the woody\nlane, Skiddaw, as blue as solid cobalt, rose calmly up into a\nwandering storm-white sky.  And yet for all this witchery of colour,\nfor all this magic transformation scene, one vision stayed--that\nfar-off wreath of quiet snow,--snow that had turned on nearer view to\nscent and sound, to life and light and laughter, to power and\nimpassioned loveliness, there in the resonant chasm of Lodore.\n\n\n\n\n{189}\n\nA NORTH COUNTRY NIMROD.\n\n        We shall never hear again\n        On the fell or in the plain\n          John Crozier's 'Tally-ho!'\n        Never see him through the rain\n        And the sun, with might and main\n  Follow on from crag to crag, while the hounds give tongue below.\n\n        Dark the valley east and west,\n        Clouds are on Blencathra's crest.\n          The hunter home has gone:\n        And the Squire they loved the best\n        Now is carried to his rest--\n  Eighty years has Death the huntsman followed hard--the\n      chase is done.\n\n        But I think I see him stand--\n        Rough mountain-staff in hand,\n          Fur cap and coat of grey--\n        With a smile for all the hand\n        Of the sportsmen in the land,\n  And a word for all the merry men who loved his 'Hark-away!'\n\n{190}\n\n        Last hunter of your race!\n        As we bear you to your place,\n          We forget the hounds and horn,\n        But the tears are on our face,\n        For we mind your deeds of grace,\n  Loving-kindness late and early shown to all the village-born.\n\n\n'It's a dark daay for Threlkett is this un, hooiver!

It's a dark day fer Threlkett, I'se telling ye, and dogs\nhes lost best friend and t' foxes t' warst enemy they've ivver hed\nhere-aboot.'\n\n{191}\n\nWe were standing by the Druid's Circle on Castrigg Fell, and as the\nold yeoman spoke to me I looked across the valley to the great\nbuttressed height of Blencathra--blacker to-day beneath, by reason of\nthe slight snow covering on its summit, and saw in its grove of\nlarches the white house, half-farm, half-mansion, whence the oldest\nMaster of the Hunt, in Britain, had gone for his far journey.  Never\nagain would the men who follow the hounds pass through the gate of\nthe Riddings, with the fox and the hound carved in stone on either\nside of them, to be met and to be greeted by the cheery old Squire on\nhunting days; never again, after a long day's hunt, would they repair\nto the Farrier Inn or to the Salutation Inn, mid-village, to wait the\ncoming of the Master 'ere they all 'howked in' to the 'tatie-pot' he\nhad provided them.\n\nThere was a time when all the farmhouses for miles round, and every\ncottage home, was glad, because a Threlkeld man had come to his own\nagain, and I could not help contrasting the gladness of that day, as\ntold us by Wordsworth in his _Feast of Brougham Castle_, and _Song of\nthe Shepherd Lord_, with the sadness of this day for all the country\nside, {192} now that another shepherd-lord had gone unto his own.\nThat shepherd-lord we read\n\n        'Was honoured more and more,\n  And ages after he was laid in earth\n  \"The good Lord Clifford\" was the name he bore.'\n\nThey were very different men, that shepherd-lord and this our friend,\nthe Master of the Blencathra Hunt, John Crozier: but both of them had\nbeen reared in the same quiet pastoral scene, and among the same fine\nrace of shepherd gentlemen.  Both had learned the lesson of this\nmountain side,--\n\n  'Love had they found in huts where poor men lie,\n    Their daily teachers had been woods and hills,\n  The silence that is in the starry sky,\n    The sleep that is among the lonely hills.'\n\nBoth men had won the hearts of the simple people far and near, and\nages after he is laid in earth, as he will be laid by the side of his\nbeloved wife, in the Threlkeld Churchyard, men will speak of 't'ald\nSquire,' and enthusiastically tell of his hunting feats, and remember\nhow he loved his native village.\n\nThe love of hunting which John Crozier inherited from his father, who\nlived at Gate Ghyll Farm on Blencathra's side, and who {193} turned\nover to his son the mastership of what were then spoken of as 'the\nThrelkeld dogs' in the year 1840, is a passion with our dales' folk\nwhich only those who live amongst them can understand.\n\nThe 'varmint' is the natural enemy of the shepherd, and this adds\nzest to the day's sport.  In our churchwardens' accounts of old time\nthere appears the item 'A fox head, 21s.,' and though in other\nchapelries 3s. 4d. appears to have been the price paid, such a\nscourge must Reynard have become that the churchwardens felt they\nwere justified in giving a whole week's wage for the destruction of\none fox.  Down at Shoulthwaite and, for aught I know, in other dales\na fox trap of masonry existed till of late years, built beehive\nfashion with a hole in the top.  If Reynard ventured in to the bait,\nwhich was a fine fat hen, he was a prisoner; try to scale the walls\nhow he might the artful one was foiled; but to trap a fox goes\nagainst the grain.  There are certain things in which our hunt\ndiffers from others.  Class distinctions are unknown in the field.\nThe Master of the Hunt knows all by their Christian name.  It is a\nsocial gathering from daylight to dark.  The luxury of horses, too,\nis unknown.  The {194} field are all running huntsmen of the type of\nold Timothy, of whom Wordsworth wrote, in the year 1800--the\nchildless Timothy who took up his staff, and with the thought of his\nlast child's death heavy upon him could nevertheless not refuse the\ninvitation of 'the horn and the hark! hark-away,' and 'went to the\nchase with a tear on his cheek.'\n\nOn that day when 'Skiddaw was glad with the cry of the hounds,' old\nTimothy's daughter Ellen had been dead five months or more, or he\nprobably would not have followed the hunt, for there is a kind of\netiquette that the hunters in the dales observe, and they would no\nmore go a-hunting within a month after the death of their beloved,\nthan they would miss going to church on the Sunday following the\nfuneral.  I remember once being asked by a widower, who was in great\nsorrow and could not get away from his thoughts, whether he should\ntake what he knew to be the best physic--a day with the dogs.  I\nasked, 'What would your wife have said?'  His answer came quite\nstraight: 'She wad hev clapped a bit o' lunch in my pocket, gi'en me\nma staff, shut door upon me, and telt me not to show my feace until\nsupper time.'  I answered, 'That's enough,' and the man was a new\n{195} being when he returned from the hunt, more able to wrestle with\nhis sorrows.\n\nThe women folk are as keen as their husbands.  They tell of a 'woman\nbody' at Wythburn who, joining the hounds in full cry, and finding\nher skirts in the way, stopped, took a knife out of her pocket, and\nslit her petticoat in order that with a 'divided skirt' she might the\nsurer be in at the kill.  How keen the men are, is shown by the fact\nthat beginning as youngsters to follow the drag, and carrying on a\nlove of the sport through the prime of manhood, they may be still\nfound from 75 to 80 and over, out with the hounds at the call of the\nhorn.  Nay, even when their sight fails them, they will follow, and\nit is on record that a veteran whose eyes were failing him and who\nhad the rare good luck of a vantage ground to see the finish of the\nhunt, and was so maddened by the hurried and eager account from his\ncompanions of how the hunt was going, that he cried out 'Hang thur\naid een o' mine!  I wish that they wer nobbut out all togidder; I\nbelieve I wad see better through t' hooals!'\n\nFox hunting in the Lake Country tests the sportsman.  None but a true\nlover of the chase would be content to breakfast and get {196} away\nwith the stars (as in winter he oft-times has to do that he may get\nto the heights before the hounds are loosed)--and, facing all\nweathers, come back with the stars.  He has to battle with storm and\ntempest.  It may be fine in one valley and a roaring blizzard on the\nother side of the mountain.  The old veteran, John Crozier, himself\nwould tell of how he had to lie down on Skiddaw summit in a sudden\nand blinding snowstorm, and on more than one occasion he and all the\nhunt have suddenly been enveloped in a thick mist, which made\nmovement almost impossible.  And hunting not only tries the heart, it\ntries the head.  A fox gets 'binked,' as they call it, or banked, and\nsome one must go up on an almost inaccessible crag to put in the\nterrier; and a man must know the country, and the probable run of\nevery fox that gets up in front of the hounds.  There is no earth\nstopping; only the bields are known, and the cunning of Reynard is a\nsecret, to be learnt not only by the huntsman and whip but by every\nsingle man in the field.  As for the foxes, though the old greyhound\nbreed that John Peel knew--20 lbs. to 29 lbs. in weight--have passed\naway, the little black-legged Irish fox can give a good account {197}\nof himself, and from three to five hours and from 25 to 40 miles have\nnot been an uncommon experience of a run.\n\nAt the beginning of last century it was not an unusual thing for the\nhounds to be running 'on the tops' through the night, and the legends\nof the 'whish-hounds,' or 'spirit-packs' of Cornwall and Devon might\nvery well have been reborn in Borrowdale.\n\nIn 1858 took place one of the record runs of the Blencathra pack.\nThe dogs had had already a good morning's work when at noon a big\nSkiddaw fox jumped up in front of them.  He tried to shake off his\npursuers by the ordinary hill tactics, but, failing, took to the\nvalley, went by Crosthwaite Church, through Portinscale and\nBrandelhow, right up Borrowdale, and over the Styhead into\nWestmoreland.  The night fell, but the dogs were heard at Black Hill,\nmarking the fox at an earth.  Thence Reynard escaped in the direction\nof Lancashire, and next day the hounds and the fox were found, the\nlatter dead and the former fast asleep under a crag in Coniston.\nThey must have travelled not far short of sixty miles over the very\nroughest part of the Lake Country.\n\nThe hounds are trained carefully not to break up their foxes, just as\nthey are trained {198} as carefully not to worry sheep; and this\nlatter is done by the farmers walking the dogs in the summer time and\ntaking them, along with their collies, when they go shepherding on\nthe fells.\n\nThe packs are small, but every hound is true as steel.  The\nBlencathra huntsman generally unkennels about 11 couples, and so keen\nare they at their work that three years ago they gave an account of\n76 foxes, last year of 46, and this year, up to date, of 43.  But the\ncost of keeping the pack is very small.  Â£200 clears all expenses,\nand this is partly accounted for by the kindly interest farmers, who\nare all members of the hunt, take in it, for they walk the dogs free\nof charge, and some of them are, in addition, subscribers.  Very\nanxious are these men, too, to do their best by the dogs.  The hounds\nare made members of the family, and their tempers and individualities\nare studied.  A farmer would take it very ill if he did not have the\nsame hound sent him at the end of the hunting season.  This reacts by\nmaking a bond of enthusiastic interest for members of the field in\nthe running of every dog.\n\nNor can we omit to mention the sense of brotherhood which binds the\nhunt together.  {199} As there is no separation of class, so there is\nno separation of dress; no buttonholes and fine leather boots.  The\nhunting kit is but a flannel shirt, a pair of trousers rolled up to\nthe knee, over a pair of stout woollen hose, a Tam o' Shanter, and a\nrough alpenstock.  The poorest can afford that, and the richest know\nno better.\n\nAnother bond that unites the members of the Blencathra Hunt is the\nhome-made hunting songs which are sung at the end of the day.  There\nis one written by a Patterdale yeoman, which has a good ring in it:\n\n  'Now who could help but follow when notes as sweet as these\n  Are sounding through the valley and borne upon the breeze?\n  Of all the recreations by which our lives are blest,\n  The chase among the mountains is the purest and the best.'\n\nAnd there is another favourite written by Harper, one of the roadmen\nin the neighbourhood; while Woodcock Graves' immortal ditty, 'D'ye\nken John Peel?' is never better sung than at the annual dinner of the\nBlencathra Hunt.\n\nI am standing at the Druids' Circle and looking across at Naddle.  In\nthe hollow of {200} the ridge is the school of S. John's-in-the-Vale.\nI remember that the old Squire, John Crozier, got his first learning\nat that school; and that some years after a poet of more than local\nfame, John Richardson, became its schoolmaster.  He, too,\nimmortalised the Blencathra Hunt, and one of his best songs will, for\nmany years to come, echo the 'tally-ho!' of the late Master of the\nHunt:\n\n  'The hunt is up, the hunt is up;\n    Auld Tolly's in the drag;\n  Hark to him, beauties, git away,\n    He's gone for Skiddaw Crag.\n      Rise fra ye'r beds, ye sleepy-heads,\n        If ye wad plesser know;\n      Ye'r hearts 't will cheer, if ye bit hear\n        John Crozier's \"Tally-ho!\"'\n\nThat last line calls us back to the man who has carried on, to a\ncentury's ending, the Mastership of the pack his father gave him in\ncharge.\n\n[Illustration: A NORTH COUNTRY NIMROD.]\n\nAs a lad of 18, John Crozier was already well known as a keen\nsportsman, as good with his rod in the becks and rivers here about,\nas he was with his father's hounds, and fond of wrestling as he was\nof hunting.  At that day the pack numbered only six couples.  They\nwere kept at the farms all through the {201} year, and were trained\nto meet at the sound of the Master's horn.  The old Squire would\noften tell how he would stand on Kiln Hill, blow a blast, and watch\nthe beauties racing across the meadows to his call.  John Peel, in\nthose days, was still hunting on the other side of Skiddaw, and John\nCrozier remembered the last time he saw him was under Wanthwaite\nCrags, where, after a long day's run, he invited the old veteran, who\nwas on his white pony, to come home to supper.  'Nay, nay, John,'\nsaid Peel, 'I'se freetened o' gettin' neeted (benighted),' and so\nwent back on his way to Ruthwaite supperless.  'But I'll see thee\nagain,' he added--who knows they may again have met.\n\nThe first thing the young Master did was to improve the breed of his\nhounds, and this he accomplished by getting a strain from John Peel's\nkennels.  How much of Ruby, 'Ranter, Royal, and Bellman, so true,'\nspoken of in the song, still runs in the blood of the Blencathra\npack, I know not.  Other strains since then have been introduced, but\na hardier pack never breasted a mountain side, and there is not one\nof them who would not carry on the line himself, if his fellows\nfailed, to the death.\n\n{202}\n\nJohn Crozier once received the following note: 'To J. Crozier, Esq.,\nM.F.H., from Isaac and Edward Brownrigg, of Brownrigg.  This hound\n(Darling) brought a splendid dog-fox, and after a very exciting hunt\nultimately caught it in our house field.  About an hour afterwards\nother five dogs came.  After being fed they left, but this one would\nnot leave.  We intend having the fox preserved.'  After carrying on\nthe hounds at his own cost for 30 years, 'the Squire,' as he was\nalways called, at the request of his neighbours, allowed them to\nbecome a subscription pack, in the year 1870.  There was a general\nfeeling in the dales that it was not fair to allow all the burden to\nbe upon one man, and on the conditions that he would remain Master,\nand in case of the hunt ceasing, the hounds should be returned to\nhim.  A treasurer and secretary were appointed, and the Blencathra\nHunt went on merrily as before.\n\nThe Master was fortunate in his huntsmen.  Joseph Fearon, of honoured\nmemory, was succeeded by Isaac Todhunter, who carried the horn for 25\nyears.  Isaac Todhunter handed it on to John Porter, who for a like\ntime kept up the best traditions of the pack, which Jem Dalton\ncarries on to-day.  The names of {203} these past huntsmen, with\nother members of the hunt, are inscribed on the stone of memorial\nraised in the Threlkeld Churchyard at the charges of the Squire and a\nfew friends; and that pillar in the King's dale--for of this dale\nJohn Crozier was truly king--if it does nothing else, goes to prove\nthat the following of the foxes in the Lake District adds years, even\nas it adds cheer, to the lives of the dalesmen.  Thus, for example,\none sees that many of the hunters were fourscore years before they\nwere run to earth; one was 89, another 91, another 95, and a fourth\n98.\n\nUp till the past two years the old Master of the hunt presided at the\nannual hunt dinner, but it was known that his health was failing, and\nthough each week up to the end he kept in touch with all the doings\nof his pack, he did not leave his house.  Still week by week members\nof the hunt would go up and have a 'crack' with him--always to be\nreceived with the same courteous inquiry, 'Well, how about your wives\nand families, are they well?  That's right.  Is any news stirring?\nWhat about the House last night?'  He took the keenest interest in\npolitics up to the end, and that came, not unexpectedly, at two\no'clock on a quiet starlit morning, Thursday, 5th March, 1903.\n\n{204}\n\nI could not wonder that my old friend the yeoman had said it was a\ndark day for Threlkeld, for he had lived among his own people, and\nloved them to the end.  How they loved him may be gathered from the\nfact that two days before he died, a casket containing a book in\nwhich every householder in the parish had entered his name, with an\nilluminated address, full of affection and gratitude, for the\nfriendship towards them of a long life, was brought to the house.\n'Ya kna,' said my friend, 'they knew t' aid Squire was house-fast,\nand they likely thowt 't wad cheer 'im up a laal bit.'  He never saw\nit, for it was thought he was too ill to be 'fashed' with it, and he\nis beyond all earthly cheering now; 'the Hunter is home from the\nHill.'\n\nOn the following Monday there was such a gathering together of the\ndalesmen from far and near as had never been seen in Threlkeld\nChurch, or Threlkeld Churchyard.  They sang one of the old Squire's\nfavourite hymns.  They bore the coffin to the grave with the\nveteran's hunting cap and crop and the brush of the last fox killed\nby his pack upon it, and before and after the service they talked of\nhim kindly, as Cumberland folk ever do of the dead; they spoke of\nhim, not only as the {205} oldest Master of Foxhounds in the land,\nbut as a man who entered into all the social enjoyments of the\ncountry-side, and whilst on terms of close intimacy, almost\nfamiliarity, with the companions, retained their regard, and in some\nthings set them a good example.\n\nFor in an age when the gambling spirit was abroad, it will be\nremembered that John Crozier never bet a penny in his life.  'I did\nyance think o' betting a hawpeth o' snaps,' he once said in the\nvernacular; 'but I kind of considered it ower, and I didn't.'  It\nwill be remembered of him, too, that he was against the use of bad\nlanguage in the field, and that he never would allow, if he could\nhelp it, a bit of scandal or 'ill gien gossip.'  If he heard one man\nrunning down another or passing an unkind judgment, or setting an\nunkind tale 'agate,' he would jerk out, 'There, noo, thoo mun let\nthat hare sit'--and it sat.  'Ay, ay,' said an old friend as he\nturned away from the graveyard, 'tho' he said nowt about it, he was a\nkind o' a religious man, was varra partial to certain hymns, and had\nhis favourite psalms, that he wad gang off quietly to his bit\nsummerhoose most mornings, and tek his prayer book with him.  They\nsay t' housekeeper, after her master's death, found t' aid {206} beuk\nlaid open on summerhoose taable, I suppose.'\n\nBut as they left the churchyard they all in memory saw the old Master\nin his sealskin cap, with the lappets about his ears--squarely built\nand strong, with his alpenstock in hand, as the prefatory verse tells:\n\n      But I think I see him stand,\n      Rough mountain staff in hand,\n          Fur cap and coat of grey,\n      With a smile for all the band\n      Of the sportsmen in the land,\n  And a word for all the merry men who loved his 'Hark away!'\n\nAnd as they thought of what he has been to them for the last 65 years\nin the Threlkeld vale, they admitted the truth of the following words:\n\n      Last hunter of your race!\n      As we bear you to your place,\n          We forget the hounds and horn,\n      But the tears are on our face,\n      For we mind your deeds of grace,\n  Loving-kindness, late and early, unto all the village-born.\n\n\n\n\n{207}\n\nA WINTER-DAY ON DERWENTWATER.\n\nIf November is the month for cloud effect, December certainly is the\nmonth for marvellous dawns and eventides.  Then it would appear as if\nby some generous intent to give the minds of men unwonted\ntranquillity and to impress all the dwellers in the vales with the\nthought of perfect restfulness, the sun seems to prepare for his\nrising a heaven of cloudless silver washed with faintest gold.  All\nthe heavy ragged companies of the night-wrack seem withdrawn, and\nvery slowly, while Helvellyn stands lilac-grey against the silver\ndawn, the sun rolls into sight, kindles the cones of Grisedale and\nGrasmoor, and bids the heavy dew upon the valley meadows rise up in\nfinest lines of delicate gossamer lawn.\n\nYesterday, though we had little wind in the valley, one could hear\nthe humming and the {208} roaring of what seemed a tempest in middle\nheaven, but at night-time heaven and earth were still, and the seven\nstars in Orion and the Pleiads, 'like fireflies tangled in a silver\nbraid,' shone clear, and we felt that the Frost King had come in\nearnest.  There was no snow on the hills this morning; the leaves at\none's feet tinkled as though they were made of iron; I met schoolboys\nwith rosy faces and skates upon their shoulders going off to Tewfit\nTarn--the little tarn upon the ridge dividing Naddle from St. John's\nin the Vale, that always gives our skaters in the Keswick\nneighbourhood their first winter happiness.  Down to the lake I went,\nand standing at Friar's Crag, saw that part of it was burnished steel\nand part black ebon water.  It was incredible that one night's frost\nshould thus have partly sealed the lake from sight.\n\n[Illustration: A WINTER'S DAY ON DERWENTWATER.]\n\nI was bound for Brandelhow to meet the woodman to discuss the felling\nof certain timber, and through the ice pack, if it were possible, I\nmust needs go.  Coasting along round the island, I soon found myself\nin a narrow inlet of water that stretched half across the lake; tiny\nspikules of ice that seemed like floating straws were right and left\nof me in the still water; here and there little delicate {209} fans\nof ice were passed.  These miniature ice-islands were the nuclei\nround which the freezing mixture would crystallise.  Forward across\ntowards Lingholme I steered, and suddenly should have been brought up\nsharp had not the boat, with good way upon it, crashed right into the\nice-floe and shown me how unsubstantial a thing this first\nice-covering of the lake was.  With every stroke of the oar the boat\nforged its way with marvellous sound of crash and gride, and one\nremembered how the Ancient Mariner had heard those 'noises in a\nswound,' and was able to summon up something of the roar with which\nthe great ice-breakers or steam rams on the Neva crash their way up\nand down the river to keep the waterway clear for the Baltic\nshipping.  But in a short time the difficulty of rowing became\ndoubled, and if it had not been that one saw clear water ahead one\nwould hardly have ventured forward.  Meanwhile in the wake of one's\nboat one saw how swiftly the little ice-elves repaired the damage one\nhad done by bringing back to its own place and rest each fragment one\nhad displaced, and piecing over with exquisite exactness the breach\nthat one had made.\n\nNow the way was clear, for by some {210} mysterious reason, known\nonly to the water-gods, the shallower the water became as one went\nshoreward the freer it was of ice.  It may have been mere fantasy,\nbut it seemed as if the water so near to freezing was semi-fluid,\nviscous; always right and left of one swam by the little ice\nspikules, and the ice fans, with irridescent beauty, floated and\nshone hard by.  Presently another crash was heard, and an ice-belt,\nonly a yard wide, but stretching fifty or sixty yards along, was\ncrashed through, another and another, and so, with alternate noise\nand silence, one made one's way to Victoria Point, and ran the boat\nashore at Brandelhow.\n\nBeautiful as that woodland is in early spring, it seemed that to-day\nthere were more beauties still.  The bracken was silver-dusted with\nfrost and shone gold in the sunshine, and the green velvet of the\nmosses upon tree-trunk and ground only heightened by contrast the\nrich russet of the fern.  I climbed to the russet seat on the rocky\nknoll above; there, sitting, I watched the gambolling of five\nsquirrels and listened to the crackling as their sharp teeth made\nshort work of the cones and fir-tufts.  All these little merry\nfeasters had put on their winter coats, and were much less {211} red\nof hue than when I watched them last in August.  They had put on\ntheir winter tails also.  I saw none of that curious white flaxen\ncolour which the squirrel in September seems so proud of, as, with a\nwave of his brush, he dashes out of sight.  There, as I watched these\nmiracles of motion and alertness, I thought of Ruskin--how lovingly\nhe had described them.  Here was one leaping on to a twig that bent\nwith just enough of swing in it to allow the little fellow to fly\nthrough the air to the next bough.  Here was another, now running\nalong the sturdier bough that bent not, now dropping five or six feet\ninto a dark-green tuft, now sitting cosily in a forked branch to\nmunch his midday meal, now racing for pure joy and mischief after his\nbrother up a long tree-trunk, the tail sometimes bent in an arch\nabove the tufted ears, again thrown out straight, and now bent and\nundulating--truly a balancing-pole, if ever one was needed by such\nexpert gymnasts.  Children of perfect knowledge of the woodland\nboughs, fearless as birds and swift as monkeys, the happy family\nrejoiced in the winter sunshine, as free of care as the cloudless sky\nabove their heads.  I moved, and the jay clanged and screamed from\namong {212} the alders below me, and in a moment the happy family had\nvanished out of sight, and one saw what an intercommunion of alarm\nagainst strange comers birds and beasts must surely have.  Dropping\ndown from this happy mount--and truly it has been called Mons\nBeata--I made my way through crackling fern across the chattering\nlittle brooklet to the second rocky height further to the southward.\nBlencathra lilac-grey and Walla Wood purple-brown and High Seat tawny\nyellow were reflected with such fidelity in the flood below one that\nthe beauty of two worlds seemed to be given me.  The tranquillity of\nthe far-away fells was brought right across the flood to one's feet,\na couple of wild duck dashed into the water, and with the ripplings\nof their sudden descent they set the whole fellside trembling.\nLooking now towards Cat Bels, one marvelled at the extraordinary\nbeauty of the colour.  Never was such bronze and gold seen to make\nthe sky so blue, as one gazed up to the hummock of Cat Bels; whilst,\nbetween our rustic seat and the high road, the woodland hollow was\nfilled with colour of gradation from silver-grey to purple-brown, and\nhere and there a beech tree full of leaf or a Scotch fir green and\nblue gave {213} emphasis to the general tone of softest harmony.\nPassing on through the larches upon the little height, I gained a\nthird seat, and here the chief charm was the outlook up Borrodale.\nImmediately in the foreground were young Scotch fir; beyond them the\nlake glinted in silver through leafless birches.  Away up Borrodale,\nwith every variety of lilac melting into purple-grey, ridge beyond\nridge, one saw the bossy outliers of the Borrodale ranges stand up in\nsunny calm; one felt the deep tranquillity of Glaramara and of nearer\nHonister, the only sound a distant cockcrow from the far-off Ashness\nfarm and the quiet inland murmur of Lodore.  The glory of the vale\nwas the wonderful Castle Hill, with its echo of old Rome upon its\nhead, that stood black-purple against the further lilac haze.  But as\none sat there in silent content a school of long-tailed tits came\nquavering by.  They found abundant food, it would seem, in the Scotch\nfirs close beside me, and what the squirrels had done before to open\none's eyes to their miracle of movement these long-tailed titmice did\nagain, for one here, as I sat and watched their happy quest for food.\nSuch balancing, such joyousness, such fiery energy, such swiftness of\n{214} sight, such whispering of heart's content would have made the\nsaddest man glad and the dullest marvel.  As I rose from that seat,\nwith a long look up Borrodale, I could not wonder that our Viking\nforefathers had called it the Vale of the Borg or Castle, for that\nCastle Hill in Borrodale must surely have seemed to them a giant's\nhold, the fittest place for some high fortress-camp, as it had seemed\nto the Romans of an older day.\n\nIf the first height one had ascended was rightly called 'Mons Beata,'\nand the seat one had last left was placed on a hill that might be\ncalled Mons Blencathrae, which gave such fair prospect of Blencathra,\nsurely this fair mount might be called 'Mons Borgadalis,' or the\nMount of Borrodale.\n\nI heard a whistle, and to my answering hulloa came a shout.  The\nforester was waiting for me away up there on the highest point of the\nwoodland, not far from the main road and above the Brandelhow mines.\nDescending swiftly and making my way through the frosty undergrowth,\nwith rabbits scuttling here and there and a soft-winged owl lazily\nfluttering from a bough above my head, I was suddenly aware by the\nscent that hung upon the fern that a fox had passed that {215} way.\nBut it must have been in the early morning or 'Brer Rabbit' would not\nhave been about and the jay would have been screaming, and, making\nthe best of my way up to the forester, we soon forgot all about bird\nand beast in our honest efforts to let in light and give fair outlook\nto the wanderers who should hither come for rest and thought in\nsucceeding summers.\n\nIt is not an easy matter to open up a woodland view--the branch of\nevery tree must be questioned, the joy of 'part seen, imagined part'\nmust be had in mind,--but the work was done at last.  We sat down for\nrest on the woodland seat on the fourth rocky eminence on Brandelhow.\nIt is a seat within only a few yards of the high road, yet so\nscreened from it that it is hardly seen; but it is a hill with so\nfair a prospect that indeed I think angels might pass the little\nwicket in the wall and visit those who rest here unawares.  There is\nno better name imaginable for this high resting-place than 'Mons\nAngelorum.'  As I thought thus the great sun rolled beyond the hills\nand all the vale lay darkened.  Cat Bels and Brandelhow went black\nand grey, while still across the lake Walla and Blencathra lay in\nfull {216} sunshine; but at that moment, unthought of before, there\nrose a band of angels all along the riverside, and tiny cloudlets\nswam up into shadow, and again from shadow into sun.  The Mount of\nthe Angels was this height rightly called.\n\n'It is likely getting late,' said the forester, 'and if you do not\nstart soon you'll happen hardly get through the ice to-night.'\n\nDown to the boat landing in Victoria Bay I went, and as I went the\nwoodland filled with a mysterious light.  I thought of St. Francis\nand the visions he had seen at Al Verna; the sun was beyond the\nhills, it had faded now even from Walla Crag, but the light from\nBrandelhow seemed to leap up from the ground, the larches so dim and\ndead before gleamed into gold; the red bracken at my feet burned like\nfire; it was an enchanted woodland; the magic after-glow was the\nenchanter.\n\n[Illustration: MONS BEATA, BRANDELHOW.]\n\nI pushed off from the shore, gained the ice-pack, crashed through it\nbut not without difficulty, and won the dark, clear water beyond.\nThe sun had sunk between Robinson and Grisedale, a dark cloud-bar had\nfilled the heavenly interspace, but there in the gap it seemed as if\nbeneath its heavy eyebrow the {217} eye of God was keeping watch and\nward above the quiet land.  One had often seen at the seaside the sun\nsink and the slender pillar of golden light reach downward to the\nshore, but never had I seen such a magnificent golden roadway laid\nupon shining water for happy dreams of tired men to follow the flying\nday, as I saw that eventide upon the silver ice and the darkling\nflood of tranquil Derwentwater.\n\n\n\n\n{218}\n\nWORDSWORTH AT COCKERMOUTH.\n\nIt was a difference that arose on the American question, between Sir\nJames Lowther and his law agent and steward, a certain John Robinson,\nin the year 1766, that was the prime cause of the fact that\nWordsworth, the poet, was born here.  For John Robinson resigned his\nstewardship, and young John Wordsworth, then only 24 years of age, 'a\nman of great force of character and real human capacity,' was\nappointed in his place to be 'law agent and steward of the manor of\nEnnerdale.'  To that post, which he occupied for the next 18 years,\nthe young man came from the Penrith neighbourhood, bringing with him\nas his girl wife a certain Ann Cookson, a mercer's daughter, who\ncould boast, through her descent on her mother's side from the\nCrackanthorpes, of Newbiggin {219} Hall, an ancestry that flowed from\nas far back as the time of Edward III.  She was thus well suited to\nmarry the son of the land agent of Sockbridge, near Penistone, who\ntraced his descent through a long unbroken line of sturdy Yorkshire\nyeomen away in the Penistone neighbourhood, as far as to the time of\nthe Norman Conqueror.  They took up their abode in the substantial\nhouse now occupied by Mr. Robinson Mitchell, then lately builded by\none Sheriff Luckock.  It bears date 1745-46, and is to-day unmarred\nand unmodernised, remaining much as it was when John Wordsworth\nbecame its tenant.  We know little of this young John Wordsworth, but\nhe must have been a man 'tender and deep in his excess of love,' for\nwhen, after twelve years of happy married life here in the old manor\nhouse beside the Derwent, his wife died from consumption, caught, as\nwe are told, by being put into a damp bed in the 'best room' when on\na visit to friends in London, he never seemed to recover his spirits,\nand he himself died six years after her, in the year 1783, on the\n30th December, and lies buried at the east end of the All Saints'\nChurch.  He lost his way on the fells when {220} returning from some\nbusiness engagement at Broughton-in-Furness, and was obliged to stay\nout all night; the chill from exposure brought on inflammation of the\nlungs, and his strength, sapped by deep domestic sorrow, could not\nbear up against it.  The orphans whom he left, Richard, William,\nDorothy, John, and Christopher, four of whom were remarkable in after\nlife, were then removed to the care of their uncle Cookson at\nPenrith, and Cockermouth knew them no more.  We have been allowed,\nfrom William Wordsworth's autobiographical notes and his poems, to\nglean something of those early days.  The poet tells us:\n\n            Early died\n  My honoured mother, she who was the heart\n  And hinge of all our learnings and our loves,\n  Nor would I praise her, but in perfect love!\n\nWe can in fancy see her in earnest converse with Mr. Ellbanks, the\nteacher of the school by the churchyard, talking about William's\n'moody and stiff temper'; we can hear her say 'that the only one of\nthe children about whom she has fears is William; and he will be\nremarkable for good or evil.'  We may note her pinning on the child's\nbreast the Easter nosegay, for the young lad is to go {221} up to the\nchurch, to say his catechism.  Daffodils I expect the flowers were:\nyears after, in the ecclesiastical sonnets Words worth, speaking of\nthis act of his mother's, writes:\n\n  Sweet flowers at whose inaudible command\n  Her countenance phantom-like doth reappear.\n\nOr we can see the father, book in hand, hearing the lad recite the\nlong passages of Shakespeare, and Milton, and Spenser which were\ninsensibly to mould his ear to music, fire his imagination, and make\na poet of him.\n\nBut when I think of Wordsworth in those childish days I do not go off\nto the ancient school by the church to hear him stumble through Latin\nverbs.  He was not as happy there as he was at Mrs. Birkett's, the\ndame's school at Penrith; there was no Mary Hutchinson to keep him\ncompany; and he learned, he tells us, when he went to Hawkshead at\nthe age of ten, more Latin in a fortnight than he had learned the two\nprevious years at Cockermouth.  No, rather when I want to see the\nlittle William Wordsworth at his happiest, I go with him into the old\nManor House Terrace garden {222} by the Derwent's side, and see him\nwith his sister, that sister 'Emmeline,' as he called her, chasing\nthe butterfly, or hand in hand peering through the rose and privet\nhedge at the sparrow's nest, 'wishing yet fearing to be near it.'\n\nOr, follow him with his nurse, he a child of only five years of age,\nbathing and basking alternate, all the hot August day in the shallows\nof the mill pool, and leaping naked as an Indian through the tall\ngarden ragwort on the sands, and clapping his hands to see the\nrainbow spring from middle air.  Or I go with him by the river,\n'winding among its grassy holmes,' whose voice flowed along his\nearliest dreams--that Derwent he could never forget--away to the\nCastle-hold of the barons of old time, Waldeof, Umfraville, Multon,\nLucies, and Nevilles, and watch him peering with look of awe into the\ndark cellar and dungeons, watch him chase the butterfly through the\ngrim courts or climb after the tufts of golden wallflower upon its\nbroken battlements.\n\nBut happiest of all was he when with his story book he lay full\nstretched, as he describes in the _Prelude_, upon the sun-warmed\nstones and sandy banks 'beside the {223} bright blue river,' and\nthere feasted his little heart on fairy tale and filled his soul with\nscenes from wonderland.\n\nWordsworth was never unmindful of the home of his birth.  He left\nCockermouth for schooldays at Hawkshead when he was a boy of nine,\nand though in the holidays, for the next five years, he paid an\noccasional visit to the place, his chief vacation associations were\nwith Penrith.  The Poet's connection with this town ceased at his\nfather's death in 1784, when he was a lad of fourteen; but he never\nforgot it.  From nature and her overflowing soul here in his\nchildhood days he had received so much that all his thoughts were\nsteeped in a feeling of grateful remembrance of it.  He visited the\nhome of his childhood occasionally to refresh his heart with a cup of\nremembrance, and we find a note of a certain visit in Dorothy's\nletter to Mrs. Marshall.  Writing in September, 1807, she says:--'W.\nand M. have just returned.  They were at Cockermouth, our native\nplace you know, and the Terrace Walk--that you have heard me speak of\nmany a time--with the privet hedge, is still full of roses as it was\nthirty years ago.  Yes, I remember it for more than thirty years.'\n\n{224}\n\nIn 1836 he interests himself in a scheme for building a new church.\nHe writes to his friend Poole, of Nether Stowey, for assistance to\nthis object.  He tells him that Cockermouth is in a state of much\nspiritual destitution, nearly 6000 souls and only 300 sittings for\nthe poor.  Wordsworth cared for the poor.  'I have been the means,'\nhe says, 'of setting on foot the project of erecting a new church\nthere, and the inhabitants look to me for much more assistance than I\ncan possibly afford them, through any influence that I possess.'\n\nAs a Keswick parson, I gather with pride further on in that letter,\nthat it was the fact of the new church of St. John's having been\nbuilt there that spurred him on; and that he hopes Cockermouth will\ndo as Keswick has done, and thus excite other towns to follow so good\nan example.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Cockermouthians of that day were\nnot of one mind in the matter, or the Poet had been misled as to\nnative church feeling; for the inhabitants having a windfall of Â£2000\ngiven them by the Lord of Egremont that year, to spend as they\npleased, preferred a new market place to a new church, and the old\nPoet {225} writes:--'This was wanted, so we cannot complain.'\n\nBut Wordsworth was disappointed and grieved too at the spirit of\nunkindness shown by some of the people of his native town to his good\nLord Lonsdale.  I have had access to a MS. letter of Wordsworth's,\nwhich shows that the Church-building project fell through, as far as\nhe was concerned, by reason of what he considered the unfair\ntreatment of an offer of help, made by the then Lord Lonsdale to the\ntown, in connection with the church accommodation needed.\n\nSo far as I know this was the last public work he attempted to do for\nthe place that gave him birth.  But at least we cannot regret that\nhis last effort was in a cause near to his heart, the cause of the\nreligious interests and life of his fellow Cumbrians, the cause of\nreverence, worship, and godly fear, of 'pure religion breathing\nhousehold laws,' the cause of the worship and praise of Almighty God,\nhere in his native place.\n\nThe seed he sowed, though it lay dormant, did not fall on barren\nground; and in a real sense the present All Saints' Parish Church may\nstand as a monument to the immortal Poet, who then, as ever, {226}\nchampioned 'in perilous times the cause of the poor and simple,' and\ndid what he might in his day for church life and piety in the place\nof his nativity, Cockermouth.\n\n\n\n\n{227}\n\nMOUNTAIN SILENCE AND VALLEY SONG.\n\n  Once more the Heavenly power makes all things new.\n\nThis was the line from Tennyson's poem that kept ringing in my ears,\nas on the mid-most day of April I wandered out and away across the\nvale to the skirts of Skiddaw.\n\n  Opens a door in Heaven;\n    From skies of glass\n  A Jacob's ladder falls\n    On greening grass,\n  And o'er the mountain walls\n    Young angels pass.\n\n  Before them fleets the shower\n    And burst the buds,\n  And shine the level lands,\n    And flash the floods,\n  The stars are from their hands\n    Flung thro' the woods.\n\nNo, no! this last couplet was untrue; the anemones had not yet opened\ntheir delicate {228} shells, and the blackthorn buds were only\ndimmest seed-pearls of yellowish lustre.  But as I gazed from the\nfence halfway up Latrigg and watched the Greta flashing, and the\ngreat plain fresh-enamelled with the first faint green of spring, a\nJacob's ladder was let down from above Scafell and Glaramara, and all\nthe angels that ever came on earth to fill men's hearts with April\njollity came trooping downwards.  They took on various forms.  Some\nof them became tortoise-shell butterflies that lay in sunny content\nupon the moist woodland path.  Others sailed out of blue air and\nbecame glorious peacock butterflies upon whose underwings in blue and\nblack one clearly saw the head and face of human kind sketched in\nwith lustrous powdery pencillings.  Other angels ministered to the\npink coral glumes of the sycamore; others, again, daintily untwisted\nthe leafage of the wild rose in the hedge; others delighted to unfold\nthe tufts upon the elder.  But the angels that seemed to be busiest\nwere those that made the vivid emerald of the 'dog's mercury'\ncontrast with the faded red of the bracken in the woods, and where\nthe purple birches showed against the flowering larches {229} added\nmoment by moment a deeper, ruddier purple to the trees' beauty and a\nfiner flash of green to the surrounding wood to set the purple off.\n\nBut all the gifts of the angels of that April morning seemed as\nnothing when compared with the joy of the sight of one single angel\nof the spring--he a lustrous-backed swallow who flashed from\nsteel-purple into black and from black to steel-purple, and\ndisappeared from sight behind the larches.  I had known of his\ncoming, for a swift-eyed shepherd had seen one of his kind in the\nvalley as early as April 1, but April 13 to the 15th was marked in my\ncalendar as swallowtide, and I had not expected sight of him till\nthis week.  Here he was, glossy with African sun, and full of silent\nmessage that summer was sure.  The chiffchaff would be a-trill and\nthe cuckoo would be calling for a mate within the week.  Ah, swallow!\nswallow! flying north!  How much of hope and happiness you bring.\nThen as I moved through the larchen grove, I heard the titmice\nwhispering that they too were glad, they too felt reassured by sight\nof the swallow, and one walked on in a kind of consciousness that man\nand {230} swallow and budding larches were more akin than one had\nbelieved, until the joyousness of spring found the selfsame echo in\nsuch divers hearts, and that indeed the over-soul was one, the music\nand the melody one voice.  Yes, Wordsworth sang truly when he wrote:\n\n  One impulse from a vernal wood\n    May teach us more of man,\n  Of moral evil and of good,\n    Than all the sages can.\n\n\nI met a child halfway up Latrigg braiding her hat with larch flower.\nTruly no rubies ever seemed so rich and rare as these which the\nsimple village child had twisted in her hat; her sister had a handful\nof primroses she was taking to her father in the neighbouring\ncottage, for he was but slowly recovering from pneumonia, and the\nchild knew by instinct that a breath from a primrose posy would do\nmore for him than all the 'doctors' bottles' in the world.\n\n'You have been up Skiddaw betimes,' I said.\n\n'Ay, ay, sir; you see they've gone to \"laate\" Herdwicks to-day for\nlambing-time, and I went up to the Gale with the dogs.'\n\nHerdwicks!  Lambing!  What did it all {231} mean?  Only that those\ngreat brown slopes of Skiddaw which till this day have been vocal\nwith flocks and alive with sheep, will by this eventide be as silent\nas the grave.  For between April 10 and April 20 the shepherds know\nthat the Herdwicks will become mothers of their springtide young, and\nso they will go forth to the fells and upland pastures, to bring\ntheir woolly charges down from the mountain heights to the safety and\nthe food and care of the dale-farm enclosures.  I overtook the\nshepherds at the 'Gale,' and went with them.  Soon the dogs were seen\nscouring the fell-side, now disappearing from sight, now coming back\nto get a signal from their master.  A wave of the hand to left or\nright was all that was needed, and away they went, and slowly and\nsurely they seemed to be able to search out and bring into a close\ncompany the Herdwicks from all the heathery waste and grey-bleached\nmountain hollows.\n\nThen began the home-bringing.  Very tenderly and gently did the dogs\nurge the sheep, heavy with young, down the fell-side slopes.  Now and\nagain the shepherd cried, 'Hey, Jack!' and away the collies flew back\ntowards him.  'Ga away by!' {232} and away again the collies flew in\na great circle out beyond and behind the sheep.  The sheep were a\nlittle hustled and came on too fast.  Then the shepherd whistled and\nheld up his hand, and the dogs sat like stones till he whistled and\nwaved his hand again.  So down from Lonscale and across the gulfy\nWhitbeck the sheep came.  The dogs dashed off to where, through a\ngreat carpet of ever-lucent moss, the main fountains break from the\nhill.  They slaked their thirst, then came back slowly to urge the\nflocks homeward and downward toward the Shepherd's Cross, and so over\nthe Gale to the Lonscale Farm.  We stopped at the Cross, and a tall,\n'leish,' handsome man, with fair hair and the grey Viking eye, said\nin solemn undertone, 'Fadder and brudder cud hev been weal content to\nbe wid us on sic a day as this, I'se thinking.'  And the mist\ngathered in his eyes, and he said no more, but just went homeward\nwith the sheep.  Ah, yes, that Shepherd's Cross tells of men--father\nand son--who spent their whole lives in following the Herdwicks on\nthe sides of Skiddaw and Lonscale Fell; wrought for their sheep,\nthought of them by day {233} and dreamed of them by night, and were\nas proud, as ever David was, of what they looked upon as the finest\nlife a man need care to live, the mountain shepherd's round of love\nand toil.\n\nI waved adieu, and up beyond the huts to 'Jenkin' I went.  The red\nfern had been washed into faintest ochre, the heather had grown grey\nwith winter storm, but everywhere beneath the blanched grass one felt\nnew life and tenderest first flush of April green was astir; and as\none looked down from 'Jenkin' into the circle of the deep blue hills\nand the Derwent's perfect mirror, one saw that though the larches\nwere still brown there was an undertone of something, neither brown\nnor green, that flooded not only the larch woods but the great\nLatrigg pastures also, and betokened that the spring was even at\ntheir doors, and that the fells would soon rejoice with the emerald\nvalley below.  Gazing at the vale of Crosthwaite, where still all the\ntrees seem winter white, one was astonished at the darkness of the\nhedgerows that divided the meadows, and one saw the new fallows shine\nand swim like purple enamel upon the green flood of the springtide\ngrass.  'Jenkin' was reached, {234} but not until many swathes of\nlingering snow, black with the smoke of the blast furnaces of the\ncoast and of Lancashire and Yorkshire mills, had been passed.  Here\nat 'Jenkin top' we found two men hard at work 'graaving' peats for\nthe Coronation bonfires on June 26.\n\n'Well, how goes the peat-graving?' said I, and a ruddy-faced Norseman\nfrom a Threlkeld farm said, 'Aw, gaily weel, sir; but I'm thinking we\nmud hev nae mair kings upo' the throane, for this job will finish t'\npeat moss, and peats are hard to finnd within reach o' Skiddaw top.\nYou see,' said he, 'it's lost its wire, and peat widout wire in it is\nnae use for makking a \"low\" wid.'\n\nI saw that what he called 'wire' were the rootlets of the ancient\nundergrowth of years gone by, the matted texture of primeval\nspringtides, and, stooping down, he broke a peat across and showed me\nthe wire.  'You kna,' he continued, 'we shall just leave peats\nligging here, and thoo mun send up scheul-lads to spreead them in a\nforthnet's time.  Then they mud coom oop a week laater and shift 'em\nand turn them, and then a week laater they mud coom and foot 'em.\n{235} That is if thoo want 'em in fettle by Coronation-daay, for they\nare ter'ble watter-sick noo.'\n\n'Foot them?' I said.  'What do you mean?'  And the shepherd took a\ncouple and leaned them one against another, and showed me how thus a\ndraught of air passed between the peats and ensured their drying.\n'Well, good-daay, good-daay.  But we mud hev nae mair kings to be\ncrooned,' said he; 'for peat moss ull nobbut howd oot for this un,\nI'm thinking.'\n\nI bade farewell, and down to the valley I went, noting how doubly\nnear and blue the hills and vales all seemed to grow, as one passed\ndown beneath the veils of haze which had lent both greyness and\ndistance to the view.  Again I saw the swallow skim; again I watched\nthe gorgeous butterflies, and, with a wand of palm-flower that had\njust lost its gold, and the rosy plumelets of the larch in my hand, I\nmade the best of my way homeward, through air that throbbed and\nthrilled with the voice of thrush and blackbird, and felt the deep\ncontrast between these silent flockless slopes of Skiddaw, and the\nringing singing valley at his feet.\n\n\n\n\n{236}\n\nINDEX\n\nNDX A\n\nAdelaide, Queen, 46.\n\nAmbleside, 18, 22, 44, 53.\n\n_Angler, Complete_, 120.\n\nApril song, 81.\n\nArnold, Dr., 19, 50.\n\nAveling's town, King, 59.\n\n\n\nB\n\nBallads, Lyrical, by Wordsworth, 125.\n\nBarf, 169.\n\nBassenthwaite, 97, 102, 105, 107, 169.\n\nBeltane fire, 147.\n\n_Birthright, The Christian_, 162.\n\nBlack Hill, 197.\n\nBlencathra, 113, 165, 192, 212, 214, 215.\n\nBoon Beck, 30.\n\nBootle, 172.\n\nBorderside, 131, 132, 140, 143, 144.\n\nBorrodale, 52, 180, 183, 197, 213, 214.\n\nBorrow Bridge, 143.\n\nBowness Church, 138.\n\nBrandelhow, 197, 208, 210, 214, 215, 216.\n\nBrankers, 49.\n\nBrigham-cum-Mosser-cum-Lorton, 173.\n\n_Brougham Castle, Feast of_, by Wordsworth, 191.\n\nBroughton-in-Furness, 220.\n\nBrowne, William George, 98.\n\nBrowning, Robert, note, 5.\n\nBrownrigg of Brownrigg, 202.\n\nBrundholme, 157.\n\nButcher lad's reminiscences of Wordsworth, 8.\n\nBurns, 141.\n\n\n\nC\n\nCaermote, 104, 106.\n\n_Calling, The Gentleman's_, 162.\n\nCarlisle, City arms of, 96.\n\nCarlyle, 96, 141, 164.\n\nCarnigill, 143.\n\nCartmell Fell, 121, 125, 147.\n\nCastle Hill, 213, 214.\n\nCastrigg Fell, 191.\n\nCat Bels, 212, 215.\n\nCat Ghyll, 181.\n\nCausey Pike, 109.\n\n_Cavalier, Memoirs of a_, 120.\n\nChartres Cathedral, 90.\n\nChestnut Hill, 110.\n\nChristmas season in Grasmere, 71.\n\nClappersgate, 49.\n\n\"Clock, The Village,\" 30.\n\nCockermouth, 173, 218, 220, 221, 223, 224, 226.\n\nColeridge, Hartley, 12, 19, 23, 24, 25, 31, 36, 38, 43, 44, 50, 58,\n138.\n\nColthouse, 141.\n\nConiston, 2;

'so long reason memory remain, never forget {129} many delightful hours have passed together, whether reading some favourite poet rambling among beautiful scenes nature.' 'i believe,' added, 'that seldom have two persons come together more sympathy than two, have often felt my separation was one my greatest losses leaving part country.' those rambles mentions walking-tours took 1817 through derbyshire, 1818 the craven country yorkshire. kept journals, full delightful observation men things are, redolent real joy sunshine cloud. writes, 'we walked forward delightful morning vigorous steps. the lark was our constant companion, cheering overhead her song, the fresh air the mountains bathed our cheeks, there was freedom care the feeling liberty 'when the fretful stir unprofitable, the fever the world hung not upon the beatings our hearts.' 'we felt something,' adds, 'of \"that blessed mood which the burden the mystery, {130} which the heavy the weary weight all unintelligible world lightened: serene blessed mood which the affections gently lead on.\" the end his derbyshire journal says 'the remembrance those happy days derbyshire lie the landscape his memory, like spots stationary sunshine; be him his friend wells pure water amid desert sands which their souls fly refreshment hereafter hours weariness amid the din towns cities the many shapes joyless delight.' did ever city man take back city roar barrenness more quiet more profit country ramble? his last letter thomas smith, spoke left the manchester neighbourhood. the autumn 1820 gave up his work the manchester bank. never think his native vale without sense heartsickness; his work was irksome city life hateful. his poem the river winster dated 1821, writes: 'and the heavy time after life, buried the midst toil strife trading towns, intermission sweet sought my dull toil, my fancy fleet {131} was straight amid thy vernal meads flowers, thy hanging fields, wild woods, leafy bowers. nor think beauty earth, still 'twas seen thee--as thy birth mine been together. now ease free wander whereso'er please, what charms find along thy simple stream, beloved winster!' wonder yeoman farmer's son who thus write, have felt irresistibly drawn exile manchester his native vale, find him back the yews, correspondence, now the editor county paper, now miss wordsworth, now writing ballad poem, now natural history note, now wandering off down duddon vale, through the lake district, now keenly interested little dilapidated estate the crosthwaite township called sometimes borderside, sometimes balderside, perhaps more accurately viking phrase, bauta-side, determining go into the farming line. he became purchaser the borderside estate 1822; once he determined let five years, gave his whole time the rent boot, the improvement it. the summer the same year he became an estatesman, he planned tour into scotland. wordsworth wrote him full {132} particular itinerary, william pearson followed the footsteps the bard, really made the same journey wordsworth's first excursion scotland. there an interesting note the peasants recollection burns ayrshire, the sabbath manners certain the auchterarder folk, the journal otherwise a little tiresome. the next ten years spent the not very profitable work mending the fences outbuildings borderside, then attempting make crops pay the rent leave something over. 1841 he 'declined' farming, not without the secret joy getting back his mother's house the yews, all his books stored, the _encyclopÃ¦dia_, just bound, was awaiting him. he not been idle, he made the corn laws a study, concluded unjust, cruel, impolitic. he done what he get the kendal folk abolish the old system selling fruit baskets, paniers containing sixteen quarts, introduced the better system selling weight. the spring 1842 his mother died, {133} now, the age sixty-two, william pearson felt free marry. he married ann greenhow heversham may. he was instinct a tiller the ground; he used say 'no one felt more dependence upon god than the farmer his fields.' he turned his attention fruit culture, planted a large orchard 300 trees two lesser ones, felt he not lived vain. was during period he began making notes the habits the bird beast life round about him. some observations the habits the hedgehog which he sent 1836 mr. wordsworth sent the poet the members the kendal natural history society, which pearson been a member almost the first. the result communication evoked, cornelius nicholson, the then secretary, tells us, much enthusiasm, a class was determined mutual instruction the habits distinctive faculties birds beasts. was pearson's habit attend the monthly discussion meeting society, he thought nothing setting off after an early tea walking nearly seven miles kendal walking back starlight after the lecture. {134} was part his life between the years 1825 1833 belong the glimpses his intimacy the rydal mount family, shown the letters, chiefly dorothy wordsworth, have been preserved us. clear william pearson was a most welcome guest rydal. excursions up helvellyn planned the wordsworths, natural history notes exchanged. the letters chiefly interesting giving hints the simplicity the life there, often full thanks him a panier apples, a leash partridges, contain a request straw the stables, seek his advice purchase a pony, send requisition more potatoes the like. william pearson was looked upon the henchman who be best trusted supply the rydal mount farm produce, clear the bidding the bard be steward his stable economics was a real pleasure him. he also sent dorothy wordsworth's sick-room just those delightful little nature anecdotes which cheered her her retirement. he admired honoured the poet's sister. 'never,' says he one his letters smith 1832, 'have known a more {135} amiable woman. her understanding judgment the highest order. have heard mr. wordsworth say he been more indebted her judgment than any other person.' the correspondence gives little facts dates household matters interesting students the poet's life rydal. example, learn may 5, 1830, the next day be finished the new terrace, the poet's satisfaction; learn also wordsworth's constant trouble 1833 onward reason the inflammation his eyes. hear incidentally poor a horseman, good a walker the poet is, the simplicities hospitalities rydal mount brought before us. was not only steward the farm orchard pearson was truly honoured the wordsworths. was because the poet felt him he a real lover his art, a real understander his poetry his philosophy. one not surprised find wordsworth thanked him the occasion when, the kendal paper, the worthy yeoman took up pen defence the poet. those who years after honoured the dead poet's memory--his {136} personal friends, dr. davy others--were grateful william pearson when, 1854, he championed, a letter full feeling knowledge, the protestantism the bard, which been called question a lecturer the protestant alliance kendal, who described wordsworth's poetry being 'one the principal means the revival priestly domination the church england.' very touching see really he valued the friendship the poet he well understood honoured. 'what claim have i,' he wrote dorothy wordsworth, 'on the notice a man like brother? my chief obligations him conferring his society hospitable notice hope shall feel the latest hours my life.' writing wordsworth borderside under date 1849, he says, 'i felt very grateful letter. reading the first few lines was sorry think much mrs. wordsworth's handwriting changed, found was indeed own hand the tears came into my eyes. shall preserve kind memorial shall not part till part everything life.' these the words a real hero-worshipper, he cause hero-worship. {137} what wordsworth's poetry did inspire keep pure true serene the heart william pearson, still men humble country life the years be. to-day more soul among our farmer folk, want a _vade mecum_ the tiller the soil shall lift his soul heaven. cannot doubt men study wordsworth receive his 'heart into their own,' there be dignity happiness added many a daleside home. return william pearson. he found the farm life the whole a happy one. he not have given up he not determined marry. his orchards prospered, his hay grass was generally well got. his frugal ways ensured him competency, all day every day he was learning more nature's secrets, more the pleasant ways birds beasts about him. he was making observations, too, the changes come over the vale lythe the neighbouring fells common lands, since the packhorse ceased be, the common enclosures the larch planters come in. his ears open also the quaint sayings superstitions, his eyes the quaint ways customs the dalesmen {138} amongst whom he dwelt moved, these observations bore good fruit the paper written 1841, the year before his marriage, the kendal natural history society, entitled 'a sketch some the existing recent superstitions westmoreland.' was doubtless a source gratification william pearson the son the poet be the officiating minister bowness church the day he led his wife the altar, may 1842. he needs have been pleased his return low house after a wedding jaunt through the lakes, find hartley coleridge, who called congratulate him his marriage, left behind him an impromptu sonnet. had, most hartley's sonnets have, a little touch description the life both himself his friend, the gentle estatesman: 'a little man solitary life half an idiot too--more helpless still-- wish all joy thee thy wife; thy love be constant thy will. my gentle friend, happy mayst thou be! thou hast a wife pray--and pray thee.' during the coming june 1842 pearson took his wife the continent. he long {139} planned trip; writing his friend thomas smith april 1841, tell him his intended venture 'that variety untried being,' marriage, he says mr. wordsworth advised him make a swiss italian tour before age renders him unfit foot-travel, adds his future wife 'is an excellent walker, quite willing share the fatigue, he sure she share the pleasure.' there a note simplicity intention see the swiss italian lakes afoot--the bridegroom now more than three score years, a 'young heart travels many a mile,' william pearson's heart was young the last. wordsworth supplied him an itinerary which he faithfully followed. after the tour stayed until the spring versoix, near geneva, his journal shows he was busy making naturalist notes all the while. there a touching note his journal his delight getting back his westmoreland home. the blue mountains the well-known fells, the ivy-covered cottage low house, the happy greetings beloved friends. these deeply moved him. there was suitable house the happy couple crosthwaite, after staying {140} low house the winter, he went into lodgings high crag. lodgings not william pearson's ideal home life, though he was a man sixty-seven he determined 1847 build a house his own estate. was a glad day him when, he tells us, the last day july, 1848, he crept into the bosom his own cheerful cot 'with measureless content,' a cottage 'unclothed rough-cast,' he told wordsworth, 'but exhibiting a goodly row chimneys pretty round tops square pedestals, the only specimens yet crosthwaite the revived good old fashion.' have a poet's description borderside home the pen perceval graves, who, writing dovenest 1862, thus describes it: 'red roses flush native stone, the grassy slope, the rocky mount gay flowers,--a shadowy fount murmurs cool delicious tone. beneath, an orchard far wide its blossom its front displays; across the valley friendly rays neighbour houses hail borderside.' here the next eight years dwelt the refined thoughtful yeoman, reading such {141} books he felt he could afford buy, such books he could borrow kendal, lent him coleridge perceval graves wordsworth; corresponding such naturalists waterton gough, such students perceval graves dr. davy, keeping up constant communion the friends rydal mount; getting hold the best could be the scientific treatises the day; dipping here there into theologic problems; studying his shakespeare his milton, enjoying his carlyle, his burns, his scott, his reed's _english literature_, impressing, he met him, such a man sir william hamilton, examining the theories agazziz brewster moraine glacier action, comparing his own natural history observations those waterton white selborne; time time, he returned some ride 'nep' 'camel,' his favourite ponies, sitting down chronicle the beauty the day's outing, the wild life bird beast he observed. amongst the latter be noted his papers the partridge the squirrel, 1846; the woodgrouse, 'new bird' which appears have come colthouse first the autumn 1845 (this paper was {142} written 1850), again the hagworm, 1852; 'notes characters habits domestic animals, 1854'; 'a few recent notices natural history, 1855.' all pearson's prose a dignity simplicity directness makes one realise he been a reader the masters english style, makes one feel also he a poet heart, he writes his prose. take example his account the glede kite--alas! long vanished our land, though nesting the ferry late the beginning last century;--'i have seen,' says he, 'the glede his beautiful flight, words mine adequately describe it. was a windy day autumn winter he generally made his appearance. imagine a bird measuring five feet between the tips his wings. glide along required apparently mechanical effort, no fluttering the wings, not the tremor a feather. was not flying sailing the bosom the air, an effort the will, such ease, such grace, such dignity.' the evenings borderside spent reading. a mellow musical voice much feeling it, render a passage some favourite poet, often not the {143} old man's voice falter he say, 'i cannot go on,' tears rolling down his cheeks he put the book down. perceval graves, his great friend the later years, ofttimes come over high discourse heart communion dovenest borderside. he described those pleasant visits thus: 'and our cheerful meal was o'er, a meal which friendship seemed bless elegance homeliness charm scarce known before. swiftly flew the hours away, thought feeling deeply stored mind heart all forth poured loving faith lively play!' the summer 1856 was memorable a waterspout fell hay-time the 8th august, upon carnigill, near borrow bridge; who travel the l.n.w.r. tebay the south still see the wounds upon the mountain side the fury the torrent made. the phenomenon was minutely described the old meteorologist a letter mr. davy. was the last august he see. the long walks over fell moor gave way pony-back, pony-back gave way {144} a carriage. was clear all who knew delicately chiselled face noble brow the yeoman poet naturalist, all his mental powers clear his eye undimmed, his natural strength was abating. the spring 1856 the winster folk noticed though he visited, was his wont, all the orchards miles round, he visited his gig, men knew his constant cough his old enemy, bronchitis, was pressing him sore. every sunny day found him sitting his book under the shadow the famous ash tree borderside, still night time, the stars clear, saw a tall figure wrapped a plaid, stick hand, pacing slowly the garden path, before the door was shut lights went out. his own light, went out, painlessly almost seemed, december 16th. a day two before, he gone the window his sick room, said, 'in another month the snowdrops be here.' the snowdrops came, alas! eyes others almost too dim tears see them. the day his death, more properly, his falling sleep, the sunset brightened the west, the dying man the instinct an observer keen the last, turned his {145} face the window see the glory grow. then he sighed passed other glory beyond all sunsetting. his work remains, little need be said. always thoughtful, accurate observation, pure style, refined diction, delicate poetic appreciation. one much regrets he who 1808 espoused the 'terza rima' have soon quitted the sonnet's scanty plot ground left few examples his work. amongst the miscellaneous papers letters natural history remain three which county cannot be too thankful for. one a paper 'on certain changes have taken place late years a part the lake district,' its notes 'pack-horse-routes,' 'implements primitive husbandry,' 'the introduction larch planting,' 'commons enclosure,' its interesting account the ancient lythe marsh. another a paper form six letters thomas gough containing 'notes a few subjects the natural history crosthwaite lythe, the valley winster.' he prefaced series letters an apparent quotation which really was his own saying which, a lover st. francis {146} all his true followers, dare repeat.--'these lonely denizens the earth, our fellow pilgrims the journey life, have their appointed tasks have, set out the great creator.' there spoke the heart the wise old winster estatesman, who long known the bond love binds the travailing creation into one, who he moved among his brother birds flowers, felt the glory his brother sun, his sister the homeside fire, also then 'with bliss ineffable could feel the sentiment being spread o'er all moves all seemeth still o'er all leaps runs shouts sings beats the gladsome air, all glides beneath the wave, yea, the wave itself mighty depth waters.' the last two papers be mentioned 'the sketches some the existing recent superstitions westmoreland': most valuable these are, written just the nick time. the two generations have passed since he collected his material penned his notes, have ceased hand the traditional sayings become too matter fact be 'boddered wid sic things charms boggles dobbies barguests wisemen witches.' {147} there no one the county westmoreland to-day who care take their children plagued the kink-cough up cartmel-fell, chance clipping a hair the cross an ass's back then tying round the bairn's neck a sovereign remedy the troublesome whoop. not been william pearson doubt have known the winster dalesfolk, notwithstanding the cross was set here the clearing many centuries ago, actually fire-worshippers carrying the rites baal their beltane-fires

crosthwaite hodge hill cartmel-fell, where, prevent the death calves after birth, large fires kindled the open air near the farm house a living calf laid upon burnt death. the reality this superstitious relic sun-worship, the year 1840, william pearson actually witnessed here crosthwaite, and, a quotation his paper {148} upon this point, close this notice his life work: 'the need fire again made its appearance. there present a rumour a dreadful epidemic among cattle, which shown itself different places this part our country, which been coming slowly up the south, prevailed last summer. sunday afternoon, the 15th last november, returning kendal way brigsteer, reached the brow the hill overlooks pleasant village, whence there a glorious prospect, was somewhat surprised see, crosthwaite, two three large masses white smoke \"rising up like the smoke a furnace.\" thought was lime-burning, some kilns not usually occupied. reached crosthwaite, found myself the immediate neighbourhood one these \"smokes,\" which was rising very thickly below the church tower. enquired a young woman standing the road what was the meaning all this smoke. \"oh,\" said she, \"it the need fire.\" well, thought i, much have heard it, have never seen the need fire. not miss this opportunity having ocular evidence all its {149} mysteries. reaching che spot, found the fire burning the narrow lane called kirk lane, within about twenty yards the kirk tower, about half a dozen cattle huddled together kept close the fire, amongst the smoke, a number men boys standing each side them, narrow lane. sometimes drove through the fire, such was the thickness the smoke could scarcely perceive the actors this strange ceremony--men cattle. \"so,\" said i, \"you giving a smoke.\" \"yes,\" replied the owner the cows, \"we wish be like our neighbours.\" \"but have got the real need fire?\" \"yes, believe so, came down crook yesterday.\" now heard been low levens a few days before, this

hawell; later years most the 'yellow' conservative meetings the district seen his manly form heard his manly words what he used call 'the national cause.' joseph hawell was a conservative a unionist; 'thoro'-bred' he used say, his father his mother felt he did matters political, he thought 'they mixed a laal bit yaller wid his poddish' he was a boy. any rate he have liked well enough have branded

henceforth these brothers' one aim life seemed be could most help their father improve the herdwick breed, maintain his honour a shepherd. 1869 the family migrated uldale the secluded farm col.

do, he yet found time study night. he took politics his father before him had taken them, and, having gained confidence public speaking, he worked hard his speeches the preparing them. books he had not many good; he specially delighted biographies history. he never tired reading the _spacious times great elizabeth_, the _history wellingtons wars_, _nelson's exploits_; the royal jubilee armada tercentenary came round, no stronger hand more willing heart was found the whole neighbourhood build up the huge bonfire stack skiddaw top than joseph hawell's. write see him, the perspiration streaming down his honest face, building away the peats, handing up the paraffin, bucket bucket; hoping, he told then, there was not a man canny cumberland feel the fiery glow a patriot's heart night. he never help skiddaw top more; never, alas, shall go the {156} shepherds' meeting wylie ghyll him again, see him the ram fair, hear him a 'yaller' speech day, sit him his own fireside 'crack' about the herdwicks. thought influenza laid its deadly hand upon him early the year 1891, simultaneously he had some ailment the gums--toothache he called it. have been something more serious; he went off keswick see the doctor: the doctor lanced the gum, the wound took bad ways, within a day so the strong man was bed, weak delirious. he wished be up after the sheep. be about his father's business! and, a cold spring day, friday, february 20th, an angel came the lonely farmstead lonscale, bid the brave man's spirit fare the way all who really wish heavenly father's business go uncomplainingly. still joseph hawell's heart was had ever been--at home england. he thought some strange hands taking him away force another land, the last words he spoke these: 'no! die, least die an {157} englishman english ground!' so he died. the strong hand one stronger than man had taken him; a few days more, february 23rd, hands tender strong, the hands an affectionate brother true friends, bore the body a shepherd, dead his prime--for he was 36 years old--down through the cow-pasture over the gurgling glenderaterra, so through the silent brundholme woods above the wailing greta away its rest english earth beneath the shadow the old church st. kentigern, the crosthwaite valley, within sight horned hill skiddaw he had loved so well. the people keswick begged his body be carried through their sorrowful town opportunity be given showing sympathy respect. many a stalwart yeoman came the homegoing. little said, felt much moved their dark market-carts toward the burial. 'eh, what! it's a terrible loss all!' 'the best man amang gone.' 'we all mun ga t' time comes, it's hard bearing this.' 'niver a handier man wi' {158} t' sheep i' t' whoale forest.' 'niver a better man clim't t' fell; a decent, stiddy man iver was; niver heard a wrang word him.' 'eh, but! it's past finding out t' way young uns goes, auld ones stays.' 'poor lass, she's lost good a mate ever woman had.' 'poor barns, they've lost a fadder afore kent him.' so sorrowfully turned away the grave, whereon flowers had been strewn wreaths laid hands men who their common regret forgot all party differences thought only joseph hawell, a man the 'blues yellows' alike proud life, alike determined honour death. was a traveller foreign lands the news joseph hawell's death reached me, felt a moment stunned. realised it, seemed did not care see skiddaw again. he was a piece it; skiddaw without him be no skiddaw all, such an ideal yeoman shepherd; so tender-hearted the yeanlings; so true his mountain flock; such a man among men, honest upright, reliable; one always knew somehow joe was present, men right left him {159} behave like gentlemen; so high-minded bent the 'just true'; and, 'as the great ones only are, his simplicity sublime.' his influence was wider deeper than he had dreamed of, felt joe hawell a power had worked righteousness a whole fell-side community, had passed far visible form goes the earth. reaching home, was a sad heart neared the solitary fell-side farm had been so darkened loss. there was the same kitchen; the fiddle was the wall; the bacon flitches hung the rafter; the stuffed heads the two old favourite shepherd dogs, 'dainty' 'rob,' looked out under the triumphal arch sickles the wall; the gun rested close by; the medicine horn lambing bottle their places, the old row books the father he had so often turned thought inspiration, their shelf--but there was no joe! robert took the hand bade sit the settle, he tell all about it. the poor wife said nothing, just rose quietly began spread the table set tea, urged not have her fash {160} herself so put herself out the way me, she urged have been joe's wish, said no more. then the dogs came in. 'ah,' said robert, 't' rough un, \"jess,\" not forgitten her master yet. she was sair put out o' t' way my brother lay ill, whined nights not be comforted; she only just now, after ten weeks' coaxing, consented follow go the fell.' [illustration: joseph hawell.] 'and did have no thought joseph's worsening,' said, 'when he took ill?' 'no,' said robert, 'but rather a strange thing happened just a week before. i not superstitious, i said little about it. i woke early just was beginning be dawn saw a sad face looking upon me. i knew the face well, was joe's wife's sister, i thought i was dreaming sat up, the face still looked very sadly then faded away, i felt be a vision. i have wondered since was meant a token us. she was the first person, however, came help joe died. singular, not? eh dear! it's a sair heart i have i go shepherding now; it's i'm amang {161} t' sheep i mostly what seem miss him. comes ower t' warst i am looking t' ewes used talk ower together. like see some the letters, i daresay, received poor joe went.' saying this, the stalwart man, who loved his brother tenderly a woman, put a bundle letters into my hand. 'but,' said i, i gave back these precious documents the owner, 'did he not leave any papers behind him? he spoken one letter gifted beyond ordinary measure a public speaker.' 'well,' replied the brother, 'he left very little writing; know kept his speeches. scattered up down the newspapers.' following into the herdwick-prize room, i soon found myself deep the speeches joseph hawell had time time delivered the political cause he championed. i asked he took much trouble the preparing his speeches, i was told he did; worked hard nights beforehand, sometimes, our greater orators have done, learned a bit his intended speech heart. joseph had library, up there the rafter-smoke, some old 17th {162} 18th century tomes, full the breath english spoken pure. english history was his chief study; 'here,' said the good wife sadly, 'is a book he oft read in, particularly sunday afternoons.' was a magnificent folio copy _the whole duty man_, _the gentleman's calling_, _the art contentment_, _the christian birthright_, printed norton, oxford, 1695. i turned over its well-thumbed pages i thought joseph hawell had gone good models his masterful english, had drunk wholesome draughts goodly thought wisdom he studied. 'did he leave no other written papers?' 'yes, he left a few songs he wrote time time.' i asked see them. 'god save ireland disunion,' was the title one; another, rough copy, was a sheep-shearing song. had joseph written anything else? yes; there was just one letter two he had left behind him rough copy, i was welcome see i cared. i did care; was rewarded. he had latterly been a bit troubled his mind a friend who had what called 'free-thinking notions.' joe, who was {163} dead against kind cant any religious cant--and he was, i testify, hard upon this latter--had delivered his soul. the letter was written february 9th, 1891, the hand wrote was cold stiff february 20th. i dare look upon this letter the yeoman shepherd's last testament. runs follows: 'dear friend,--i have received books, am much obliged. i have not yet got them read thoroughly, so far have caused a reaction my mind favour the christian religion, led have recourse some fine old books written more than a hundred years ago, a bold intelligent hand, proving astronomy science a powerful proof the majesty an almighty creator. 'could follow up science winging way the highest star observation, there see other skies expanded other planets systems established, each giving harmony perfection attention time the nicest rule. then wend way past other ten thousand worlds, the end this vast tour still be muddling the suburbs creation, only find no imagination {164} fix the limits his creating hand, conceited, ignorant, insignificant man absolutely unable comprehend the grandeur correctness his magnificent workmanship. then am i be told the builder this stupendous structure incapable such a paltry performance taking possession our souls restoring our lifeless bodies his own good pleasure? 'i find,' he adds, 'carlyle's work very instructive, many the passages furnish evidence the existence the great disposer all events.' i said this stand joseph hawell's last testament. no; there was another letter, written evidently just the end last year, which he begs a neighbour the loan a horse gear enable him bring down a sledge lonscale crag one the finest single stones there. he wishes set up some field the farm, have his father's name upon his father's deeds prowess a breeder herdwick sheep, a single verse descriptive poetry beneath, he feels sure his friend will lend a hand 'to erect a monument least one member the hawell family whose stainless, honourable, {165} straightforward life will always be pointed pride his descendants.' joseph hawell! the horses have gone, the sledge brought its heavy burden the home-farm; engraved two names instead one, there those who honour the son who so have honoured his sire. there mountain path both them knew so well old the grey memorial cross set, carved, symbol eternity, the endless knot their norse forefathers used. a simple verse engraved the base. those who pass the 'gale' the meadows lonscale, breast the back blencathra, climb the slopes skiddaw, shall surely learn our cumberland mountains still old breed men high purpose noble endeavour; still, following the sheep, god calls his chosen ones lives kindliness, simplicity, straightforward goodness, guide their brothers the path duty, righteousness, truth. {166} a famous yew-tree. there a passage george fox's _journal_ brings one face face a brave man god, reveals the spirit true martyrdom, makes one envious his dazzling courage: 'now great threatenings given forth cumberland ever i came there again take away my life. i heard it, i was drawn go cumberland, went the same parish whence these threatenings came, had not power touch me.' a passage attracts one the apostle the leathern-apron, makes one desire know the scenes his life's travail. was not be wondered at, therefore, one found oneself keswick a neighbouring valley lorton, one wish visit one the places ever associated his memory, see the spot whence {167} the echoes the preacher's voice have never died. associated this wish follow the footsteps george fox, was the desire see the yew-tree, 'pride lorton vale,' which, the day fox's sermon, provided seats the listeners. the famous yew-trees the lake district becoming each year fewer. true the great yew tilberthwaite still standing, famous hollow trunk kept alive the name the mission preacher st. patrick, patrick's dale patterdale, fallen; the great winter storm 1883 worked havoc upon seathwaite's sacred brotherhood: 'those fraternal four borrowdale, joined one solemn capacious grove; huge trunks!--and each particular trunk a growth intertwisted fibres serpentine up-coiling inveterately convolved-- now a wreck,--one fell, the others riven pieces. here the lake district, command bluff king hal, each estatesman was obliged plant a yew-tree his homestead, order he never lack wood his bow he was called--as he not unfrequently was called--to the marches, defence the {168} border. many places, long after the homestead passed away, the solitary yew survives tell the troublous times old. was not long since an estatesman sent down the local museum keswick the old oaken bow-chest his fathers, which, though it been long used a meal-ark, its carving clearly shows it was intended other use. the family name bowman a common one cumberland, still our neighbourhood the field-names preserve a memory the village bowman's prowess, the 'butts' field a word common parlance. it george fox, the man peace, most interested in, crossed the keswick valley climbed the long slope whinlatter pay a visit the brave man's preaching place, it was mere coincidence preaching place be associated weapons war. [illustration: the lorton yew.] people not realise fair a view the whole skiddaw range presented them they climb pass, they climb it oftener. the higher one climbs, the higher skiddaw appear, deep-bosomed mountain-side all its massy grandeur emerald green lilac shade spring, puce burnished bronze autumn, {169} impresses one its calm restfulness. the cloud, sure sign fine weather, rests upon its utmost peak to-day, irresistibly recalls the lines wordsworth's sonnet: 'veiling itself mid-atlantic clouds pour forth streams more sweet than castaly,' while the pleasant farms the far-off interchange happy cock-crowing, glitter our feet, and, like an arm some great ocean-loch, the white waters bassenthwaite come round the precipice barf, sweep out the shadow wythop woods into the september sunshine. our left rises grasmoor, haunt the dottrel, hobcarton crag, beloved rare mountain flowers. so crest the long slope drop down into lorton, the hill-sides our right, golden gorse against the westering sun. turning sharply the left soon the village reached, pass a kind pleasant rural street, may be called a street which houses only the one side it, just emerge into the country again, find ourself a spot the road forks, a portion it going over a beck bridge into a farm enclosure a picturesque old water-mill byre, a portion it,--the main road {170} loweswater,--bending sharply the right go across the valley the north side the stream, which here hidden view a long barn building. pause this point cannot help being struck the sombre mass a great yew-tree standing a pleasant meadow close the beck, one time there was doubtless a ford. this what wordsworth described 'a yew-tree, pride lorton vale, which this day stands single, the midst its own darkness, it stood yore, not loth furnish weapons the bands umfraville percy ere they marched scotland's heaths; those crossed the sea drew their sounding bows azincour, perhaps earlier crecy, poictiers. vast circumference gloom profound this solitary tree!--a living thing produced too slowly ever decay; form aspect too magnificent be destroyed.' it not to-day the noble tree it was fox was here, the prophecy the poet was only a few years since like have been made utterly vain. its form aspect was so magnificent its owner sold it a lorton wood merchant, it was just about be cut down some memory fox's {171} sermon awoke the breast a faithful member the society friends the neighbourhood, the wood merchant good-naturedly went off his bargain. it true it shows no signs decay, it suffered loss. two its main stems shattered years ago a hurricane, sawn off the bole. let go along the road the farm buildings, turn back down what now serves a watering-place horses. it thus shall best get an idea 'it stands single, the midst its own darkness.' the branches stretch their shadow over the stream, the ripple the sunny talkative beck contrasts strangely the deep silence the solemn tree. we go up whinfell hall ask a keen observer nature plant life about this famous yew, mr. wilson robinson will tell he once measured the trunk its least circumference found it 23 feet 10 inches, that, about thirty years ago, a strong south-east gale came hurricane force down hope ghyll, wrenched off one the side limbs carried away a third the tree. another limb fallen since then, yet, shattered torn, what a magnificent ruin it {172} is, well worth climbing over whinlatter pass visit. after gazing up the beck towards the picturesque bridge which we first surveyed the yew, towards the grand old farmstead its cluster sycamores a background the bridge, let go back the bridge across into the meadow wherein the 'pride lorton vale' stands, and, gazing under the tree towards the west south, let wonder the beauty faintly bronzed fern whiteside, the amethystine lilac the grasmoor mass, the far-off cones red pike high stile blue above mellbreak, far the west, herdhouse ghostly grey; all seeming join shutting out the world making the quiet emerald meadow which we stand a sanctuary thought restfulness. then let go back day the year 1653 george fox, having narrowly escaped death a boy's rapier thrust, his hand wrist still smarting the cruel blow a rough fellow down bootle, they mobbed him the previous sunday, pale worn came hither the ford found already james lancaster, one his disciples, who had gone forward {173} an avant-courier the way cockermouth, busy haranguing the people. the quiet meadow to-day was day full armed men. a detachment cromwell's soldiers had been told off cockermouth keep the peace--it being known fox was his way lorton; mr. larkham, the congregationalist minister cockermouth, priest wilkinson, the vicar brigham-cum-mosser-cum-lorton, probably among the crowd covered the field stood the banks the stream. 'the people,' we read fox's _journal_, 'lay up down the open, like people a leaguer.' fox had seen something camp life during the late civil war, he doubtless felt day that, man peace though he was, the field the lorton yew be indeed a field battle him. what interests most we gaze upon this venerable tree to-day these pleasant pastures beside the waters peace, not so much the memory the crowd cromwellian soldiers members the church militant who came out day 'sorely withstand' george fox, the vision the boughs this sable majestic yew-tree {174} filled the listening ears eager eyes those who heard day the weary way-worn prophet the lord, 'largely declare the word life' he knew it, 'open the everlasting gospel them.' fox tells 'this tree was so full people i feared they break it down.' look it now, think it no longer a broken yew-tree, sown here perchance some far wandering bird centuries ago, a living witness the power men who have a living gospel declare win the souls their fellows, lead them into communion god who a spirit. men once heard the voice fox sound out here, above the babble the beck the hum the multitude the protests the lorton minister, those who crowded the yew-tree boughs felt light instead darkness--sun instead shadow, was their portion, we read, 'many hundreds convinced day, received the lord jesus christ his free teaching gladness.' we not quakers, least our hearts beat unison the earnest teacher the truth he knew, an age {175} was helped still helped truth; we leave the field the tree, 'not loth furnish weapons the bands umfraville percy ere they marched scotland's heaths; those crossed the sea drew their sounding bows azincour,' we rejoice think beneath its sable boughs, the preacher the way peace better than war, once preached a sermon; we trust, many a long year still, 'single the midst its own darkness it stood yore,' may stand the lorton yew. {176} lodore after storm. five days continual tempest five nights storm-wind the atlantic had tried the nerves tempers tested the sleeping powers all the keswick vale. nothing like wind set folks 'fratching'; anybody was still speaking terms his neighbour argued well the kindliness the townsmen villagers. last it seem the wind had blown itself out, six o'clock a grey february evening silence calm fell upon the sodden, weary vale. an ominous cloud-pack boiled up over the western hills, the barometer went down two inches. the cattle scarcely 'suppered up' the night the farmsteads the shopmen had scarcely clanged down their last shutter, the wind again awoke, the hills thundered the trees groaned, we {177} knew america had sent another cyclone. the hail-showers thrashed the panes, the windows rattled, the chimneys moaned sighed, though tired men women went bed, it was only feel their house-walls shake an earthquake shock passing underneath, only wonder which be the first chimney-stack fall. the wind grew a hurricane, people they lay sleepless fear upon their beds heard strange voices the storm--cries sailors agony upon a bitter shore perishing the deep. then the wind would be heard try all round the house see perchance a window-frame would give an entrance indoor havoc be possible; a slate would whirl up a crack come down clattering the roof spin off into the darkness. the dawn broke dimly, the pastures the middle vale lay like a wan sea isles emerald. broken boughs hung gaunt creaking upon the nearest trees, the irish yews curtsied danced split themselves into a hundred spires nodding darkness against the angry sky. the hurricane, however much it make man cower fear, had no power upon the thrush, {178} who saw, behind the hurricane light cheerless morn, the dawn springtide love calm. no storm could 'quell disconcert her golden tongue,' there, while the wind fluffed her breast twice its size, she fluted the swaying holly tree her old familiar call the slow 'be quick! be quick!' the drowsy, 'pray, get up! get up!' then the sad 'cheer up now! cheer up! cheer up!' i answered her challenge arose. the lake end end was ridded foam, great clouds water, torn the surface, marching west east. borrodale was black storm. there was no snow skiddaw, though the sleet had a night turned its fine old head grizzled grey, over grasmoor over grisedale it seemed if some huge ocean wave had broken left its froth behind it. nearer, however, than grasmoor grisedale there was snow. far down beyond the purpling 'walla' woodland, lay, a crevice the hills between gowder crag shepherd's crag, a mighty drift seeming winter whiteness. was no gift winter; it was the gift the past night's {179} rain. gazing it through a good field-glass one could see the white drift was a falling torrent, one gazed one almost, fancy, heard 'the roar stuns the tremulous cliffs high lodore.' i knew they only see lodore aright who will brave storm tempest, so swiftly this splendid cataract pour itself away an hour after the rains have ceased upon the watendlath fells it dwindles its natural size, loses its milk-white charm, ceases summon the wanderer its presence. this morning its spell was potent touch all hearts, white winter wreath snow sound called far away. down the old monks' path we went, the hoofs sumpter-mules the middle ages had worn deep into the soft soil;--it was to-day a torrent-bed bubbling water. the village school, where, instead the pattering children's clogs upon the doorstep, to-day the greta's water gushed fell miniature cascade. over the bridge beneath greta hall, which the pencil-makers hung enforced idleness, there was too much water allow the use the millwheel. 'brig pinched be {180} large eneuf t' watter to-day,' they cried; so the town. 'dar bon! thoo bed better keep lee-side oop street---slates fleein' same leaves i' winter,' said an old friend he passed me. 'well, betty, what such a night have had?' i said another old friend the street corner. 'loavins me!' she answered, 'but it's been a capper. cwoal cart was lifted up clean turned ower befoar my eyes oor back yard; i've been up dressed sin five this morn. what i thowt wi' mysel if anything's goin' happen, it 'ull not dea fur _all_ be naked, sea i got intil my cleas!' so up the main street--powdered broken slates plaster the house fronts, out into the borrodale road we went. trees laid their heels the church gate, the holly berries gleamed thousands the roadside; the wind had done what this open winter the birds had failed do. thence the great wood. fine spruces lay across the road, the roadmen woodcutters busy making passage possible the cart traffic. such a scent christmas trees they made they hewed away the spruce branches {181} one felt oneself a child again, so a child's heart forward. all through the purple woodland white patches top-most boughs, the wounds the fierce wind had given them. only one thing the tempest had been powerless touch; these the tender lichens the velvet mosses trunk wall. how they gleamed shone the forest twilight! whilst the boughs clashed the wood was filled groans shrieks cries, there, the wall the ground the tree-stems, quiet restfulness silent beauty the fearless mosses grew. this was not all the gentle life seemed fear no storm, quavering along bough bough a school long-tailed titmice went unalarmed pleasure. the wind shook the oak seemed unable touch them, down beside me the tiny wren played his old happy game hide-and-seek, if, instead being lashed a cyclone, the woods still eventide june. cat ghyll, beloved southey, roared we passed, one heard the wind like a trumpet blowing the steep falcon crag. now clear view was gained derwentwater, one noted the lake lay long {182} patches many colours, here bright green, there slate blue, there brown, here white wan, ridged throughout foam; suddenly, if it sprang upward hidden depths, a water wraith would leap sight other spirits would join it, the whole silver company ghostlike vaporous forms would come dancing across the further shore lose themselves cloud-like dust upon the land. here again would rise a tiny waterspout spin spin the water up into mid-air, then march counter-march, lie down, rise again. while all the time upon the shore beneath the roadway, waves broke surge tumbled, moaning a troubled sea might not rest. it was something such a whirl sound hissing such restless waters feel far up the other hand, above the russet grey-green draperies the lilac shales, the calm the storm-proof citadel falcon crag. we gained barrow, heard the waterfall bellowing the wood; it was lodore we had set out see, lodore shone white clear upon its steep only half-a-mile away. full sight lodore had now been gained, not before two other cataracts flashing one channel gowder crag had claimed {183} our wonder, while we watched the water fall, it seemed, out heaven, down the silver birches, down the silver shale, turn both darkness its white contrast. what a magnificent rose-red glow those birch trees showed, how auburn glory the larches gleamed! how too silken grey delicate yellow the ash trees climbed the crags! we went forward, not till we had noted that, while all the world towards grange seemed one great grey water-flood, here right front the purple-brown cliff whose cleft lay the white lodore, stood up a little meadowy hill verdure green may--the first home-field the wandering viking who pushed his long ship ashore ravenglass made his way over the styhead pass ancient borrodale. this green field still flows the spring ketel the viking, who afterwards gave his name the wyke which we call keswick to-day, drank the olden time. ketel's well, we gaze upon emerald mound, takes back the ninth century the first coming the norsemen our dales; what was it bade the hardy norse rover choose pitch his camp the spring yonder hill same glorious cataract lodore, whose {184} gleaming waters whose voice thunder speaks our heart it one time spoke his. nay, weary wanderer over sea, lodore spoke sweeter things. he listened the torrent's voice, there came back memories his own home-land all the sound sight those fair 'fosses' those shining 'ghylls' which he was an outlawed exile. [illustration: lodore after a storm.] we pass beyond the hollies, beyond the amber reed-bed, beyond the grey copse, gain the gate the fall. we cross the meadow enter the wood stand upon the little platform whence the fall its fulness may be seen. what strikes one once the majesty the high-towering crag gowder the left lodore. what strikes one next, the feeling a certain lack height the fall. it does not come rushing over a sheer precipice; it not cloud-born; one seems know somewhere not far off a valley stream passing along through quiet meadows woodland, something the fierce wildness its fall curbed tamed the thought. yet we gaze to-day so white the heaven the rift between the cliffs whence it surges into sight, a very little imagination enables us feel if the whole white interspace foam, {185} one's heart stirred. not a rift, the topmost height we think we see hear a visionary cataract fall fall. up now through broken boulders, wet perpetual mist, slippery sodden leaf russet gold, up till a double wych elm, two elms bound sisterly embrace--as if they had fear clutched one another they stood awe upon the torrent's brink, gained; there shelter a huge rock, emerald-coated, silver-shining the spray, we shelter the drenching water-dust see another view glorious lodore. see hear, while the milk-white waters flash swirl around the ebon boulders mid-fall, we hear the tall upstanding cliffs make echo their voice--such sound he who hears can never quite forget. we climb again up a slippery path only fit a goat's foot, helped impending branches, helped more the thought yonder one will gain not only the noblest view the waterfall, a far outlook over the wide-watered vale grey-blue western hills, beyond which booms the sea gave us, the wings the wind, all this majesty sound motion. this hurricane, the salt ocean one's lips, if its actual murmurs {186} the 'scents the infinite sea' denied us, least proxy they ours. we slowly win our way upward the scent lodore fills the air, even its sound fills our ears. not the kind paper-mill scent one knows so well within the locks the backwaters the thames, scent born mountain springs fellside tarns peaty meadows--scents delicate they subtle. we have gained our vantage point sight sound. the huge rocks appear like leviathans bobbing their noses through the foam. a tree trunk fallen, seems have been caught held the mouth some vast hippopotamus, who rejoices the torrent dashes over his vast back. the sound not bellowing behemoth snorting river-horse. no; such sound seems bring all worlds unison. shut eyes, lean, listen; may hear a mighty army tramping by, may hear the clashing innumerable bells, may hear the blare trumpets, may hear the shouting a festal multitude, ever beneath the deepest harmonies the tattoo the thundering river-god, the drum-drum-drumming lodore. one cannot wonder hither 1802 {187} came charles lamb, the lover the city's roar, listen rejoice. keats, too, 1816 came hither went, lamb went back, a sadder a wetter man; it southey his two children, his edith may his darling herbert, we think to-day--he who the autumn 1809 heard the same stream saying the same things it says us to-day, who writing his brother tom board the _dreadnought_ under date october 18, 1809, said: 'i hope will approve a description the water lodore made originally edith greatly admired herbert. my mind it surpasses any the tourists have yet printed. thus it runs: \"tell the people how the water comes down lodore?

hark-away,' 'went the chase a tear his cheek.' day 'skiddaw was glad the cry the hounds,' old timothy's daughter ellen had been dead five months more, he probably would not have followed the hunt, there is a kind etiquette the hunters the dales observe, they would no more go a-hunting within a month after the death their beloved, than they would miss going church the sunday following the funeral. i remember once being asked a widower, who was great sorrow could not get away his thoughts, whether he take what he knew be the best physic--a day the dogs. i asked, 'what would wife have said?' his answer came quite straight: 'she wad hev clapped a bit o' lunch my pocket, gi'en me ma staff, shut door upon me, telt me not show my feace until supper time.' i answered, 'that's enough,' the man was a new {195} being he returned the hunt, more able wrestle his sorrows. the women folk keen their husbands. they tell a 'woman body' wythburn who, joining the hounds full cry, finding her skirts the way, stopped, took a knife out her pocket, slit her petticoat order a 'divided skirt' she might the surer be the kill. how keen the men are, is shown the fact beginning youngsters follow the drag, carrying a love the sport through the prime manhood, they may be still found 75 80 over, out the hounds the call the horn. nay, even their sight fails them, they will follow, it is record a veteran whose eyes failing him who had the rare good luck a vantage ground see the finish the hunt, was so maddened the hurried eager account his companions how the hunt was going, he cried out 'hang thur aid een o' mine! i wish they wer nobbut out all togidder; i believe i wad see better through t' hooals!' fox hunting the lake country tests the sportsman. none a true lover the chase would be content breakfast get {196} away the stars (as winter he oft-times has he may get the heights before the hounds loosed)--and, facing all weathers, come back the stars. he has battle storm tempest. it may be fine one valley a roaring blizzard the other side the mountain. the old veteran, john crozier, himself would tell how he had lie down skiddaw summit a sudden blinding snowstorm, more than one occasion he all the hunt have suddenly been enveloped a thick mist, which made movement almost impossible. hunting not only tries the heart, it tries the head. a fox gets 'binked,' they call it, banked, some one go up an almost inaccessible crag put the terrier; a man know the country, the probable run every fox gets up front the hounds. there is no earth stopping; only the bields known, the cunning reynard is a secret, be learnt not only the huntsman whip every single man the field. the foxes, though the old greyhound breed john peel knew--20 lbs. 29 lbs. weight--have passed away, the little black-legged irish fox can give a good account {197} himself, three five hours 25 40 miles have not been an uncommon experience a run. the beginning last century it was not an unusual thing the hounds be running 'on the tops' through the night, the legends the 'whish-hounds,' 'spirit-packs' cornwall devon might very well have been reborn borrowdale. 1858 took place one the record runs the blencathra pack. the dogs had had already a good morning's work when noon a big skiddaw fox jumped up front them. he tried shake off his pursuers the ordinary hill tactics, but, failing, took the valley, went crosthwaite church, through portinscale brandelhow, right up borrowdale, over the styhead into westmoreland. the night fell, the dogs were heard black hill, marking the fox an earth. thence reynard escaped the direction lancashire, next day the hounds the fox were found, the latter dead the former fast asleep under a crag coniston. they must have travelled not far short sixty miles over the very roughest part the lake country. the hounds trained carefully not break up their foxes, just they trained {198} carefully not worry sheep; this latter is done the farmers walking the dogs the summer time taking them, along their collies, when they go shepherding the fells. the packs small, every hound is true steel. the blencathra huntsman generally unkennels about 11 couples, so keen they their work three years ago they gave an account 76 foxes, last year 46, this year, up date, 43. the cost keeping the pack is very small. Â£200 clears all expenses, this is partly accounted the kindly interest farmers, who all members the hunt, take it, they walk the dogs free charge, some them are, addition, subscribers. very anxious these men, too, their best the dogs. the hounds made members the family, their tempers individualities studied. a farmer would take it very ill if he did not have the same hound sent him the end the hunting season. this reacts making a bond enthusiastic interest members the field the running every dog. nor can we omit mention the sense brotherhood which binds the hunt together. {199} there is no separation class, so there is no separation dress; no buttonholes fine leather boots. the hunting kit is a flannel shirt, a pair trousers rolled up the knee, over a pair stout woollen hose, a tam o' shanter, a rough alpenstock. the poorest can afford that, the richest know no better. another bond unites the members the blencathra hunt is the home-made hunting songs which sung the end the day. there is one written a patterdale yeoman, which has a good ring it: 'now who could help follow when notes sweet these sounding through the valley borne upon the breeze? all the recreations which our lives blest, the chase among the mountains is the purest the best.' there is another favourite written harper, one the roadmen the neighbourhood; while woodcock graves' immortal ditty, 'd'ye ken john peel?' is never better sung than the annual dinner the blencathra hunt. i am standing the druids' circle looking across naddle. the hollow {200} the ridge is the school s. john's-in-the-vale. i remember the old squire, john crozier, got his first learning that school; that some years after a poet more than local fame, john richardson, became its schoolmaster. he, too, immortalised the blencathra hunt, one his best songs will, many years come, echo the 'tally-ho!' the late master the hunt: 'the hunt is up, the hunt is up; auld tolly's the drag; hark him, beauties, git away, he's gone skiddaw crag. rise fra ye'r beds, ye sleepy-heads, if ye wad plesser know; ye'r hearts 't will cheer, if ye bit hear john crozier's \"tally-ho!\"' that last line calls us back the man who has carried on, a century's ending, the mastership the pack his father gave him charge. [illustration: a north country nimrod.] a lad 18, john crozier was already well known a keen sportsman, good his rod the becks rivers here about, he was his father's hounds, fond wrestling he was hunting. that day the pack numbered only six couples. they were kept the farms all through the {201} year, were trained meet the sound the master's horn. the old squire would often tell how he would stand kiln hill, blow a blast, watch the beauties racing across the meadows his call. john peel, those days, was still hunting the other side skiddaw, john crozier remembered the last time he saw him was under wanthwaite crags, where, after a long day's run, he invited the old veteran, who was his white pony, come home supper. 'nay, nay, john,' said peel, 'i'se freetened o' gettin' neeted (benighted),' so went back his way ruthwaite supperless. 'but i'll see thee again,' he added--who knows they may again have met. the first thing the young master did was improve the breed his hounds, this he accomplished getting a strain john peel's kennels. how much ruby, 'ranter, royal, bellman, so true,' spoken the song, still runs the blood the blencathra pack, i know not. other strains since then have been introduced, a hardier pack never breasted a mountain side, there is not one them who would not carry the line himself, if his fellows failed, the death. {202} john crozier once received the following note: 'to j. crozier, esq., m.f.h., isaac edward brownrigg, brownrigg. this hound (darling) brought a splendid dog-fox, after a very exciting hunt ultimately caught it our house field. about an hour afterwards other five dogs came. after being fed they left, this one would not leave. we intend having the fox preserved.' after carrying the hounds his own cost 30 years, 'the squire,' he was always called, the request his neighbours, allowed them become a subscription pack, the year 1870. there was a general feeling the dales that it was not fair allow all the burden be upon one man, the conditions that he would remain master, case the hunt ceasing, the hounds be returned him. a treasurer secretary were appointed, the blencathra hunt went merrily before. the master was fortunate his huntsmen. joseph fearon, honoured memory, was succeeded isaac todhunter, who carried the horn 25 years. isaac todhunter handed it john porter, who a like time kept up the best traditions the pack, which jem dalton carries to-day. the names {203} these past huntsmen, other members the hunt, inscribed the stone memorial raised the threlkeld churchyard the charges the squire a few friends; that pillar the king's dale--for this dale john crozier was truly king--if it does nothing else, goes prove that the following the foxes the lake district adds years, even it adds cheer, the lives the dalesmen. thus, example, one sees that many the hunters were fourscore years before they were run earth; one was 89, another 91, another 95, a fourth 98. up till the past two years the old master the hunt presided the annual hunt dinner, it was known that his health was failing, though each week up the end he kept touch all the doings his pack, he did not leave his house. still week week members the hunt would go up have a 'crack' him--always be received the same courteous inquiry, 'well, how about your wives families, they well? that's right. is any news stirring? what about the house last night?' he took the keenest interest politics up the end, that came, not unexpectedly, two o'clock a quiet starlit morning, thursday, 5th march, 1903. {204} i could not wonder that my old friend the yeoman had said it was a dark day threlkeld, he had lived among his own people, loved them the end. how they loved him may be gathered the fact that two days before he died, a casket containing a book which every householder the parish had entered his name, an illuminated address, full affection gratitude, the friendship towards them a long life, was brought the house. 'ya kna,' said my friend, 'they knew t' aid squire was house-fast, they likely thowt 't wad cheer 'im up a laal bit.' he never saw it, it was thought he was too ill be 'fashed' it, he is beyond all earthly cheering now; 'the hunter is home the hill.' the following monday there was such a gathering together the dalesmen far near had never been seen threlkeld church, threlkeld churchyard. they sang one the old squire's favourite hymns. they bore the coffin the grave the veteran's hunting cap crop the brush the last fox killed his pack upon it, before after the service they talked him kindly, cumberland folk ever do the dead; they spoke him, not only the {205} oldest master foxhounds the land, a man who entered into all the social enjoyments the country-side, whilst terms close intimacy, almost familiarity, the companions, retained their regard, some things set them a good example. an age when the gambling spirit was abroad, it will be remembered that john crozier never bet a penny his life. 'i did yance think o' betting a hawpeth o' snaps,' he once said the vernacular; 'but i kind considered it ower, i didn't.' it will be remembered him, too, that he was against the use bad language the field, that he never would allow, if he could help it, a bit scandal 'ill gien gossip.' if he heard one man running down another passing an unkind judgment, setting an unkind tale 'agate,' he would jerk out, 'there, noo, thoo mun let that hare sit'--and it sat. 'ay, ay,' said an old friend he turned away the graveyard, 'tho' he said nowt about it, he was a kind o' a religious man, was varra partial certain hymns, had his favourite psalms, that he wad gang off quietly his bit summerhoose most mornings, tek his prayer book him. they say t' housekeeper, after her master's death, found t' aid {206} beuk laid open summerhoose taable, i suppose.' they left the churchyard they all memory saw the old master his sealskin cap, the lappets about his ears--squarely built strong, his alpenstock hand, the prefatory verse tells: i think i see him stand, rough mountain staff hand, fur cap coat grey, a smile all the band the sportsmen the land, a word all the merry men who loved his 'hark away!' they thought what he has been them the last 65 years the threlkeld vale, they admitted the truth the following words: last hunter your race! we bear your place, we forget the hounds horn, the tears our face, we mind your deeds grace, loving-kindness, late early, unto all the village-born. {207} a winter-day derwentwater. if november is the month cloud effect, december certainly is the month marvellous dawns eventides. then it would appear if some generous intent give the minds men unwonted tranquillity impress all the dwellers the vales the thought perfect restfulness, the sun seems prepare his rising a heaven cloudless silver washed faintest gold. all the heavy ragged companies the night-wrack seem withdrawn, very slowly, while helvellyn stands lilac-grey against the silver dawn, the sun rolls into sight, kindles the cones grisedale grasmoor, bids the heavy dew upon the valley meadows rise up finest lines delicate gossamer lawn. yesterday, though we had little wind the valley, one could hear the humming the {208} roaring what seemed a tempest middle heaven, night-time heaven earth were still, the seven stars orion the pleiads, 'like fireflies tangled a silver braid,' shone clear, we felt that the frost king had come earnest. there was no snow the hills this morning; the leaves one's feet tinkled though they were made iron; i met schoolboys rosy faces skates upon their shoulders going off tewfit tarn--the little tarn upon the ridge dividing naddle st. john's the vale, that always gives our skaters the keswick neighbourhood their first winter happiness. down the lake i went, standing friar's crag, saw that part it was burnished steel part black ebon water. it was incredible that one night's frost thus have partly sealed the lake sight. [illustration: a winter's day derwentwater.] i was bound brandelhow meet the woodman discuss the felling certain timber, through the ice pack, if it were possible, i must needs go. coasting along round the island, i soon found myself a narrow inlet water that stretched half across the lake; tiny spikules ice that seemed like floating straws were right left me the still water; here there little delicate {209} fans ice were passed. these miniature ice-islands were the nuclei round which the freezing mixture would crystallise. forward across towards lingholme i steered, suddenly should have been brought up sharp had not the boat, good way upon it, crashed right into the ice-floe shown me how unsubstantial a thing this first ice-covering the lake was. every stroke the oar the boat forged its way marvellous sound crash gride, one remembered how the ancient mariner had heard those 'noises a swound,' was able summon up something the roar which the great ice-breakers steam rams the neva crash their way up down the river keep the waterway clear the baltic shipping. a short time the difficulty rowing became doubled, if it had not been that one saw clear water ahead one would hardly have ventured forward. meanwhile the wake one's boat one saw how swiftly the little ice-elves repaired the damage one had done bringing back its own place rest each fragment one had displaced, piecing over exquisite exactness the breach that one had made. now the way was clear, some {210} mysterious reason, known only the water-gods, the shallower the water became one went shoreward the freer it was ice. it may have been mere fantasy, it seemed if the water so near freezing was semi-fluid, viscous; always right left one swam the little ice spikules, the ice fans, irridescent beauty, floated shone hard by. presently another crash was heard, an ice-belt, only a yard wide, stretching fifty sixty yards along, was crashed through, another another, so, alternate noise silence, one made one's way victoria point, ran the boat ashore brandelhow. beautiful that woodland is early spring, it seemed that to-day there were more beauties still. the bracken was silver-dusted frost shone gold the sunshine, the green velvet the mosses upon tree-trunk ground only heightened contrast the rich russet the fern. i climbed the russet seat the rocky knoll above; there, sitting, i watched the gambolling five squirrels listened the crackling their sharp teeth made short work the cones fir-tufts. all these little merry feasters had put their winter coats, were much less {211} red hue than when i watched them last august. they had put their winter tails also. i saw none that curious white flaxen colour which the squirrel september seems so proud of, as, a wave his brush, he dashes out sight. there, i watched these miracles motion alertness, i thought ruskin--how lovingly he had described them. here was one leaping a twig that bent just enough swing it allow the little fellow fly through the air the next bough. here was another, now running along the sturdier bough that bent not, now dropping five six feet into a dark-green tuft, now sitting cosily a forked branch munch his midday meal, now racing pure joy mischief after his brother up a long tree-trunk, the tail sometimes bent an arch above the tufted ears, again thrown out straight, now bent undulating--truly a balancing-pole, if ever one was needed such expert gymnasts. children perfect knowledge the woodland boughs, fearless birds swift monkeys, the happy family rejoiced the winter sunshine, free care the cloudless sky above their heads. i moved, the jay clanged screamed among {212} the alders below me, a moment the happy family had vanished out sight, one saw what an intercommunion alarm against strange comers birds beasts must surely have. dropping down this happy mount--and truly it has been called mons beata--i made my way through crackling fern across the chattering little brooklet the second rocky height further the southward. blencathra lilac-grey walla wood purple-brown high seat tawny yellow were reflected such fidelity the flood below one that the beauty two worlds seemed be given me. the tranquillity the far-away fells was brought right across the flood one's feet, a couple wild duck dashed into the water, the ripplings their sudden descent they set the whole fellside trembling. looking now towards cat bels, one marvelled the extraordinary beauty the colour. never was such bronze gold seen make the sky so blue, one gazed up the hummock cat bels; whilst, between our rustic seat the high road, the woodland hollow was filled colour gradation silver-grey purple-brown, here there a beech tree full leaf a scotch fir green blue gave {213} emphasis the general tone softest harmony. passing through the larches upon the little height, i gained a third seat, here the chief charm was the outlook up borrodale. immediately the foreground were young scotch fir; beyond them the lake glinted silver through leafless birches. away up borrodale, every variety lilac melting into purple-grey, ridge beyond ridge, one saw the bossy outliers the borrodale ranges stand up sunny calm; one felt the deep tranquillity glaramara nearer honister, the only sound a distant cockcrow the far-off ashness farm the quiet inland murmur lodore. the glory the vale was the wonderful castle hill, its echo old rome upon its head, that stood black-purple against the further lilac haze. one sat there silent content a school long-tailed tits came quavering by. they found abundant food, it would seem, the scotch firs close beside me, what the squirrels had done before open one's eyes their miracle movement these long-tailed titmice did again, one here, i sat watched their happy quest food. such balancing, such joyousness, such fiery energy, such swiftness {214} sight, such whispering heart's content would have made the saddest man glad the dullest marvel. i rose that seat, a long look up borrodale, i could not wonder that our viking forefathers had called it the vale the borg castle, that castle hill borrodale must surely have seemed them a giant's hold, the fittest place some high fortress-camp, it had seemed the romans an older day. if the first height one had ascended was rightly called 'mons beata,' the seat one had last left was placed a hill that might be called mons blencathrae, which gave such fair prospect blencathra, surely this fair mount might be called 'mons borgadalis,' the mount borrodale. i heard a whistle, my answering hulloa came a shout. the forester was waiting me away up there the highest point the woodland, not far the main road above the brandelhow mines. descending swiftly making my way through the frosty undergrowth, rabbits scuttling here there a soft-winged owl lazily fluttering a bough above my head, i was suddenly aware the scent that hung upon the fern that a fox had passed that {215} way. it must have been the early morning 'brer rabbit' would not have been about the jay would have been screaming, and, making the best my way up the forester, we soon forgot all about bird beast our honest efforts let light give fair outlook the wanderers who should hither come rest thought succeeding summers. it is not an easy matter open up a woodland view--the branch every tree must be questioned, the joy 'part seen, imagined part' must be had mind,--but the work was done last. we sat down rest the woodland seat the fourth rocky eminence brandelhow. it is a seat within only a few yards the high road, yet so screened it that it is hardly seen; it is a hill so fair a prospect that indeed i think angels might pass the little wicket the wall visit those who rest here unawares. there is no better name imaginable this high resting-place than 'mons angelorum.' i thought thus the great sun rolled beyond the hills all the vale lay darkened. cat bels brandelhow went black grey, while still across the lake walla blencathra lay full {216} sunshine; that moment, unthought before, there rose a band angels all along the riverside, tiny cloudlets swam up into shadow, again shadow into sun. the mount the angels was this height rightly called. 'it is likely getting late,' said the forester, 'and if do not start soon you'll happen hardly get through the ice to-night.' down the boat landing victoria bay i went, i went the woodland filled a mysterious light. i thought st. francis the visions he had seen al verna; the sun was beyond the hills, it had faded now even walla crag, the light brandelhow seemed leap up the ground, the larches so dim dead before gleamed into gold; the red bracken my feet burned like fire; it was an enchanted woodland; the magic after-glow was the enchanter. [illustration: mons beata, brandelhow.] i pushed off the shore, gained the ice-pack, crashed through it not without difficulty, won the dark, clear water beyond. the sun had sunk between robinson grisedale, a dark cloud-bar had filled the heavenly interspace, there the gap it seemed if beneath its heavy eyebrow the {217} eye god was keeping watch ward above the quiet land. one had often seen the seaside the sun sink the slender pillar golden light reach downward the shore, never had i seen such a magnificent golden roadway laid upon shining water happy dreams tired men follow the flying day, as i saw that eventide upon the silver ice the darkling flood tranquil derwentwater. {218} wordsworth cockermouth. it was a difference that arose the american question, between sir james lowther his law agent steward, a certain john robinson, the year 1766, that was the prime cause the fact that wordsworth, the poet, was born here. john robinson resigned his stewardship, young john wordsworth, then only 24 years age, 'a man great force character real human capacity,' was appointed his place be 'law agent steward the manor ennerdale.' that post, which he occupied the next 18 years, the young man came the penrith neighbourhood, bringing him as his girl wife a certain ann cookson, a mercer's daughter, who could boast, through her descent her mother's side the crackanthorpes, newbiggin {219} hall, an ancestry that flowed as far back as the time edward iii. she was thus well suited marry the son the land agent sockbridge, near penistone, who traced his descent through a long unbroken line sturdy yorkshire yeomen away the penistone neighbourhood, as far as the time the norman conqueror. they took up their abode the substantial house now occupied mr. robinson mitchell, then lately builded one sheriff luckock. it bears date 1745-46, is to-day unmarred unmodernised, remaining much as it was when john wordsworth became its tenant. we know little this young john wordsworth, he must have been a man 'tender deep his excess love,' when, after twelve years happy married life here the old manor house beside the derwent, his wife died consumption, caught, as we told, being put into a damp bed the 'best room' when a visit friends london, he never seemed recover his spirits, he himself died six years after her, the year 1783, on the 30th december, lies buried the east end the all saints' church. he lost his way on the fells when {220} returning some business engagement broughton-in-furness, was obliged stay out all night; the chill exposure brought on inflammation the lungs, his strength, sapped deep domestic sorrow, could not bear up against it. the orphans whom he left, richard, william, dorothy, john, christopher, four whom were remarkable after life, were then removed the care their uncle cookson penrith, cockermouth knew them no more. we have been allowed, william wordsworth's autobiographical notes his poems, glean something those early days. the poet tells us: early died my honoured mother, she who was the heart hinge all our learnings our loves, nor would i praise her, perfect love! we can fancy see her earnest converse mr. ellbanks, the teacher the school the churchyard, talking about william's 'moody stiff temper'; we can hear her say 'that the only one the children about whom she has fears is william; he will be remarkable good evil.' we may note her pinning on the child's breast the easter nosegay, the young lad is go {221} up the church, say his catechism. daffodils i expect the flowers were: years after, the ecclesiastical sonnets words worth, speaking this act his mother's, writes: sweet flowers whose inaudible command her countenance phantom-like doth reappear. we can see the father, book hand, hearing the lad recite the long passages shakespeare, milton, spenser which were insensibly mould his ear music, fire his imagination, make a poet him. when i think wordsworth those childish days i do not go off the ancient school the church hear him stumble through latin verbs. he was not as happy there as he was mrs. birkett's, the dame's school penrith; there was no mary hutchinson keep him company; he learned, he tells us, when he went hawkshead the age ten, more latin a fortnight than he had learned the two previous years cockermouth. no, rather when i want see the little william wordsworth at his happiest, i go him into the old manor house terrace garden {222} the derwent's side, see him his sister, that sister 'emmeline,' as he called her, chasing the butterfly, hand hand peering through the rose privet hedge at the sparrow's nest, 'wishing yet fearing be near it.' or, follow him his nurse, he a child only five years age, bathing basking alternate, all the hot august day the shallows the mill pool, leaping naked as an indian through the tall garden ragwort on the sands, clapping his hands see the rainbow spring middle air. i go him the river, 'winding among its grassy holmes,' whose voice flowed along his earliest dreams--that derwent he could never forget--away the castle-hold the barons old time, waldeof, umfraville, multon, lucies, nevilles, watch him peering look awe into the dark cellar dungeons, watch him chase the butterfly through the grim courts climb after the tufts golden wallflower upon its broken battlements. happiest all was he when his story book he lay full stretched, as he describes the _prelude_, upon the sun-warmed stones sandy banks 'beside the {223} bright blue river,' there feasted his little heart on fairy tale filled his soul scenes wonderland. wordsworth was never unmindful the home his birth. he left cockermouth schooldays at hawkshead when he was a boy nine, though the holidays, the next five years, he paid an occasional visit the place, his chief vacation associations were penrith. the poet's connection this town ceased at his father's death 1784, when he was a lad fourteen; he never forgot it. nature her overflowing soul here his childhood days he had received so much that all his thoughts were steeped a feeling grateful remembrance it. he visited the home his childhood occasionally refresh his heart a cup remembrance, we find a note a certain visit dorothy's letter mrs. marshall. writing september, 1807, she says:--'w. m. have just returned. they were at cockermouth, our native place know, the terrace walk--that have heard me speak many a time--with the privet hedge, is still full roses as it was thirty years ago. yes, i remember it more than thirty years.' {224} in 1836 he interests himself in a scheme building a new church. he writes his friend poole, nether stowey, assistance this object. he tells him that cockermouth is in a state much spiritual destitution, nearly 6000 souls only 300 sittings the poor. wordsworth cared the poor. 'i have been the means,' he says, 'of setting on foot the project erecting a new church there, the inhabitants look me much more assistance than i can possibly afford them, through any influence that i possess.' as a keswick parson, i gather pride further on in that letter, that it was the fact the new church st. john's having been built there that spurred him on; that he hopes cockermouth will do as keswick has done, thus excite other towns follow so good an example. it is interesting note that the cockermouthians that day were not one mind in the matter, the poet had been misled as native church feeling; the inhabitants having a windfall Â£2000 given them the lord egremont that year, spend as they pleased, preferred a new market place a new church, the old poet {225} writes:--'this was wanted, so we cannot complain.' wordsworth was disappointed grieved too at the spirit unkindness shown some the people his native town his good lord lonsdale. i have had access a ms. letter wordsworth's, which shows that the church-building project fell through, as far as he was concerned, reason what he considered the unfair treatment an offer help, made the then lord lonsdale the town, in connection the church accommodation needed. so far as i know this was the last public work he attempted do the place that gave him birth. at least we cannot regret that his last effort was in a cause near his heart, the cause the religious interests life his fellow cumbrians, the cause reverence, worship, godly fear, 'pure religion breathing household laws,' the cause the worship praise almighty god, here in his native place. the seed he sowed, though it lay dormant, did not fall on barren ground; in a real sense the present all saints' parish church may stand as a monument the immortal poet, who then, as ever, {226} championed 'in perilous times the cause the poor simple,' did what he might in his day church life piety in the place his nativity, cockermouth. {227} mountain silence valley song. once more the heavenly power makes all things new. this was the line tennyson's poem that kept ringing in my ears, as on the mid-most day april i wandered out away across the vale the skirts skiddaw. opens a door in heaven; skies glass a jacob's ladder falls on greening grass, o'er the mountain walls young angels pass. before them fleets the shower burst the buds, shine the level lands, flash the floods, the stars their hands flung thro' the woods. no, no! this last couplet was untrue; the anemones had not yet opened their delicate {228} shells, the blackthorn buds were only dimmest seed-pearls yellowish lustre. as i gazed the fence halfway up latrigg watched the greta flashing, the great plain fresh-enamelled the first faint green spring, a jacob's ladder was let down above scafell glaramara, all the angels that ever came on earth fill men's hearts april jollity came trooping downwards. they took on various forms. some them became tortoise-shell butterflies that lay in sunny content upon the moist woodland path. others sailed out blue air became glorious peacock butterflies upon whose underwings in blue black one clearly saw the head face human kind sketched in lustrous powdery pencillings. other angels ministered the pink coral glumes the sycamore; others, again, daintily untwisted the leafage the wild rose in the hedge; others delighted unfold the tufts upon the elder. the angels that seemed be busiest were those that made the vivid emerald the 'dog's mercury' contrast the faded red the bracken in the woods, the purple birches showed against the flowering larches {229} added moment moment a deeper, ruddier purple the trees' beauty a finer flash green the surrounding wood set the purple off. all the gifts the angels that april morning seemed as nothing when compared the joy the sight one single angel the spring--he a lustrous-backed swallow who flashed steel-purple into black black steel-purple, disappeared sight behind the larches. i had known his coming, a swift-eyed shepherd had seen one his kind in the valley as early as april 1, april 13 the 15th was marked in my calendar as swallowtide, i had not expected sight him till this week. here he was, glossy african sun, full silent message that summer was sure. the chiffchaff would be a-trill the cuckoo would be calling a mate within the week. ah, swallow! swallow! flying north! how much hope happiness bring. then as i moved through the larchen grove, i heard the titmice whispering that they too were glad, they too felt reassured sight the swallow, one walked on in a kind consciousness that man {230} swallow budding larches were more akin than one had believed, until the joyousness spring found the selfsame echo in such divers hearts, that indeed the over-soul was one, the music the melody one voice. yes, wordsworth sang truly when he wrote: one impulse a vernal wood may teach us more man, moral evil good, than all the sages can. i met a child halfway up latrigg braiding her hat larch flower. truly no rubies ever seemed so rich rare as these which the simple village child had twisted in her hat; her sister had a handful primroses she was taking her father in the neighbouring cottage, he was slowly recovering pneumonia, the child knew instinct that a breath a primrose posy would do more him than all the 'doctors' bottles' in the world. 'you have been up skiddaw betimes,' i said. 'ay, ay, sir; see they've gone \"laate\" herdwicks to-day lambing-time, i went up the gale the dogs.' herdwicks! lambing! what did it all {231} mean? only that those great brown slopes skiddaw which till this day have been vocal flocks alive sheep, will this eventide be as silent as the grave. between april 10 april 20 the shepherds know that the herdwicks will become mothers their springtide young, so they will go forth the fells upland pastures, bring their woolly charges down the mountain heights the safety the food care the dale-farm enclosures. i overtook the shepherds at the 'gale,' went them. soon the dogs were seen scouring the fell-side, now disappearing sight, now coming back get a signal their master. a wave the hand left right was all that was needed, away they went, slowly surely they seemed be able search out bring into a close company the herdwicks all the heathery waste grey-bleached mountain hollows. then began the home-bringing. very tenderly gently did the dogs urge the sheep, heavy young, down the fell-side slopes. now again the shepherd cried, 'hey, jack!' away the collies flew back towards him. 'ga away by!' {232} away again the collies flew in a great circle out beyond behind the sheep. the sheep were a little hustled came on too fast. then the shepherd whistled held up his hand, the dogs sat like stones till he whistled waved his hand again. so down lonscale across the gulfy whitbeck the sheep came. the dogs dashed off where, through a great carpet ever-lucent moss, the main fountains break from the hill. they slaked their thirst, then came back slowly urge the flocks homeward downward toward the shepherd's cross, so over the gale the lonscale farm. we stopped at the cross, a tall, 'leish,' handsome man, fair hair the grey viking eye, said in solemn undertone, 'fadder brudder cud hev been weal content be wid us on sic a day as this, i'se thinking.' the mist gathered in his eyes, he said no more, just went homeward the sheep. ah, yes, that shepherd's cross tells men--father son--who spent their whole lives in following the herdwicks on the sides skiddaw lonscale fell; wrought their sheep, thought them day {233} dreamed them night, were as proud, as ever david was, what they looked upon as the finest life a man need care to live, the mountain shepherd's round love toil. i waved adieu, up beyond the huts to 'jenkin' i went. the red fern had been washed into faintest ochre, the heather had grown grey winter storm, everywhere beneath the blanched grass one felt new life tenderest first flush april green was astir; as one looked down from 'jenkin' into the circle the deep blue hills the derwent's perfect mirror, one saw that though the larches were still brown there was an undertone something, neither brown nor green, that flooded not only the larch woods but the great latrigg pastures also, betokened that the spring was even at their doors, that the fells would soon rejoice the emerald valley below. gazing at the vale crosthwaite, where still all the trees seem winter white, one was astonished at the darkness the hedgerows that divided the meadows, one saw the new fallows shine swim like purple enamel upon the green flood the springtide grass. 'jenkin' was reached, {234} but not until many swathes lingering snow, black the smoke the blast furnaces the coast lancashire yorkshire mills, had been passed. here at 'jenkin top' we found two men hard at work 'graaving' peats for the coronation bonfires on june 26. 'well, how goes the peat-graving?' said i, a ruddy-faced norseman from a threlkeld farm said, 'aw, gaily weel, sir; but i'm thinking we mud hev nae mair kings upo' the throane, for this job will finish t' peat moss, peats hard to finnd within reach o' skiddaw top. see,' said he, 'it's lost its wire, peat widout wire in it is nae use for makking a \"low\" wid.' i saw that what he called 'wire' were the rootlets the ancient undergrowth years gone by, the matted texture primeval springtides, and, stooping down, he broke a peat across showed me the wire. 'you kna,' he continued, 'we shall just leave peats ligging here, thoo mun send up scheul-lads to spreead them in a forthnet's time. then they mud coom oop a week laater shift 'em turn them, then a week laater they mud coom foot 'em. {235} that is if thoo want 'em in fettle coronation-daay, for they are ter'ble watter-sick noo.' 'foot them?' i said. 'what do mean?' the shepherd took a couple leaned them one against another, showed me how thus a draught air passed between the peats ensured their drying. 'well, good-daay, good-daay. but we mud hev nae mair kings to be crooned,' said he; 'for peat moss ull nobbut howd oot for this un, i'm thinking.' i bade farewell, down to the valley i went, noting how doubly near blue the hills vales all seemed to grow, as one passed down beneath the veils haze which had lent both greyness distance to the view. again i saw the swallow skim; again i watched the gorgeous butterflies, and, a wand palm-flower that had just lost its gold, the rosy plumelets the larch in my hand, i made the best my way homeward, through air that throbbed thrilled the voice thrush blackbird, felt the deep contrast between these silent flockless slopes skiddaw, the ringing singing valley at his feet. {236} index ndx a adelaide, queen, 46. ambleside, 18, 22, 44, 53. _angler,

Lowndes,\nwhich was delivered me yesterday. The truth of Captains Lightbowen and\nLowndesâ information is now verified by the presence of your father and\nsister, for whose safe arrival I pray, and that they may convey that\nsatisfaction to your soul that must naturally flow from the sight of\nabsent friends in health; and shall, for news this way, refer you to\nthem. As to what you say respecting your soon having the happiness of\nseeing us all, I wish for an accomplishment of your hopes, provided\nthey are concomitant with your welfare, otherwise not; though I doubt\nwhether I shall be present or not, for, to confess my weakness, Ned, my\nambition is prevalent, so that I contemn the grovelling condition of a\nclerk or the like, to which my fortune condemns me, and would willingly\nrisk my life, though not my character, to exalt my station. I am\nconfident, Ned, that my youth excludes me from any hopes of immediate\npreferment, nor do I desire it; but I mean to prepare the way for\nfuturity. Iâm no philosopher, you see, and may justly be said to build\ncastles in the air; my folly makes me ashamed, and beg youâll conceal\nit; yet, Neddy, we have seen such schemes successful when the projector\nis constant. I shall conclude by saying, I wish there was a war.\n\nP. S. I this moment received yours by William Smith, and am pleased to\nsee you give such close application to study.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO TILEMAN CRUGER.\n\n\n                                      St. Croix, Nov. 16, 1771.\n\nIn behalf of Mr. Nicholas Cruger, (who, by reason of a very ill\nstate of health, went from this to New-York, the 15th ult.,) I have\nthe pleasure to address you by the long-expected sloop Thunderbolt,\nCapt. William Newton, owned by Messrs. Jacob Walton, John Harris, and\nNicholas Cruger, the latter of whom has written you fully concerning\nher destination, which I need not repeat. She has on board besides a\nparcel of lumber for yourself, sundry articles on account of her owners\nas per inclosed bill of lading; and when you have disposed of them, you\nwill please to credit each partner for one third of the proceeds.\n\nMr. N. Crugerâs proportion of this, and the balance of your account\nhitherto, will more than pay for his one third cost of her first cargo\nup; and for the other two, I shall endeavor to place value in your\nhands betimes. I only wish for a line from you to know what will best\nanswer.\n\nReports here represent matters in a very disagreeable light, with\nregard to the Guarda Costas, which are said to swarm upon the coast;\nbut as you will be the best judge of what danger there might be, all is\nsubmitted to your prudent direction.\n\nCapt. Newton must arm with you, as he could not so conveniently do it\nhere. Give me leave to hint to you that you cannot be too particular\nin your instructions to him. I think he seems to want experience in\nsuch voyages. Messrs. Walton and John H. Cruger are to furnish you\nthemselves with their respective proportion of the cost of the several\ncargoes.\n\nThe staves on board, if by any means convenient, I beg may be returned\nby the sloop, they will command a good price here, and I suppose little\nor nothing with you; could they be got at I would not send them down,\nbut they are stowed promiscuously among other things.\n\nIf convenient, please to deliver the hogsheads, now containing the\nIndian meal, to the captain as water casks, and others should he want\nthem. I supplied him with twenty here. I must beg your reference to Mr.\nCrugerâs last letter of the 2d ult. for other particulars.\n\nOur crop will be very early, so that the utmost dispatch is necessary\nto import three cargoes of mules in due time.\n\n\n\n\nTO CAPTAIN WILLIAM NEWTON.\n\n\n                                      St. Croix, Nov. 16, 1771.\n\nHerewith I give you all your dispatches, and desire you will proceed\nimmediately to Curracoa. You are to deliver your cargo there to Tileman\nCruger, Esq., agreeably to your bill of lading, whose directions you\nmust follow in every respect concerning the disposal of your vessel\nafter your arrival.\n\nYou know it is intended that you shall go from thence to the main\nfor a load of mules, and I must beg if you do, youâll be very choice\nin the quality of your mules, and bring as many as your vessel can\nconveniently contain--by all means take in a large supply of provender.\nRemember, you are to make three trips this season, and unless you are\nvery diligent you will be too late, as our crops will be early in. Take\ncare to avoid the Guarda Costas. I place an entire reliance upon the\nprudence of your conduct.\n\n\n\n\nNEW-YORK, AUGUST 31, 1776.\n\n\nPAY-BOOK\n\nOF THE\n\n_State Company of Artillery_,\n\nCOMMANDED BY\n\nAlexâr Hamilton.\n\nSpecimen of Notes scattered throughout this Pay-Book.\n\n\n  Rousseauâs Emilius.\n  Smithâs History of New-York.\n  Leonidas.\n  View of the Universe.\n  Lex Mercatoria.\n  Millotâs History of France.\n  Memoirs of the House of Brandenburgh.\n  Review of the characters of the principal Nations of Europe.\n  Review of Europe.\n  History of Prussia.\n  History of France.\n  Lasselâs Voyage through Italy.\n  Robinsonâs Charles V.\n  Present State of Europe.\n  Grecian History.\n  Barettiâs Travels.\n  Baconâs Essays.\n  Philosophical Transactions.\n  Hobbeâs Dialogues.\n  Plutarchâs Morals.\n  Ciceroâs do.\n  Orations--Demosthenes.\n  Cudworthâs Intellectual System.\n  Entickâs History of the late War.\n  European Settlements in America.\n  Raltâs Dictionary of Trade and Commerce.\n  Winnâs History of America.\n  Montaigneâs Essays.\n\nThe Dutch in the Greenland fishery have from 150 to 200 sail and ten\nthousand seamen.\n\nIt is ordered that in their public prayers they pray that it would\nplease God to bless the Government--the Lords--the States and their\ngreat and small fisheries.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHamburgh and Germany has a balance against England--they furnish her\nwith large quantities of linen.

The most material is respecting the pay. Our company, by their\narticles, are to be subject to the same regulations, and to receive the\nsame pay, as the Continental Artillery. Hitherto I have conformed to\nthe standard laid down in the Journal of the Congress, published the\n10th May, 1775; but I am well informed that, by some later regulation,\nthe pay of the Artillery has been augmented, and now stands according\nto the following rates: Captain, Â£10. 13. 4. Captain-Lieutenant, Â£8.\nLieutenants, each, Â£7. 6. 8. Sergeants, Â£3. 6. 8. Corporals, Â£3. 1. 4.\nBombardiers, Â£3. 1. 4. Gunners, Â£3. Matrosses, Â£2. 17. 4. Drummers and\nFifers, Â£3. By comparing these with my pay-rolls, you will discover a\nconsiderable difference; and I doubt not you will be easily sensible\nthat such a difference should not exist.\n\nI am not personally interested in having an augmentation agreeably\nto the above rates, because my own pay will remain the same as that\nit now is: but I make this application on behalf of the company; as\nI am fully convinced such a disadvantageous distinction will have a\nvery pernicious effect on the minds and behavior of the men. They\ndo the same duty with the other companies, and think themselves\nentitled to the same pay. They have been already comparing accounts;\nand many marks of discontent have lately appeared on this score.\nAs to the circumstance of our being confined to the defence of the\ncolony, it will have little or no weight; for there are but few in the\ncompany, who would not as willingly leave the colony on any necessary\nexpedition, as stay in it: and they will not, therefore, think it\nreasonable to have their pay curtailed on such a consideration. Captain\nBeauman, I understand, enlists all his men on the above terms; and\nthis makes it difficult for me to get a single recruit: for men will\nnaturally go to those who pay them best. On this account, I should\nwish to be immediately authorized to offer the same pay to all who may\nincline to enlist. The next thing I should wish to know, is, whether I\nmust be allowed any _actual expenses_ that might attend the enlistment\nof men, should I send into the country for that purpose. The expense\nwould not be great; and it would enable me to complete my company at\nonce, and bring it the sooner into proper order and discipline.\n\nAlso, I should be glad to be informed, if my company is to be allowed\nthe frock which is given to the other troops as a bounty? This frock\nwould be extremely serviceable in summer, while the men are on fatigue;\nand would put it in their power to save their uniform much longer. I\nam, gentlemen, with the greatest respect,\n\n                                   Your most obedient servant,\n                                   Alexander Hamilton, Captain.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.\n\n                                                          July 26, 1776.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI am obliged to trouble you, to remove a difficulty which arises\nrespecting the quantity of subsistence which is to be allowed my men.\nInclosed you have the rates of rations, which is the standard allowance\nof the whole continental, and even the provincial, army; but it seems\nMr. Curtenius cannot afford to supply us with more than his contract\nstipulates; which, by comparison, you will perceive is considerably\nless than the forementioned rate.\n\nMy men, you are sensible, are, by their articles, entitled to the same\nsubsistence with the continental troops: and it would be to them an\ninsupportable discrimination, as well as a breach of the terms of their\nenlistment, to give them almost a third less provisions than the whole\narmy besides receives. I doubt not you will readily put this matter\nupon a proper footing.\n\nHitherto we have drawn our full allowance from Mr. Curtenius; but he\ndid it upon the supposition that he would have a farther consideration\nfor the extraordinary supply.\n\nAt present, however, he scruples to proceed in the same way, till it\ncan be put upon a more certain foundation. I am, gentlemen,\n\n                                  With the utmost esteem and respect,\n                                  Your most obât and most humble servât,\n                                  A. Hamilton,\n                                  Captain of New-York Artillery.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THE HONORABLE CONVENTION OF NEW-YORK.\n\n\n                                        New-York, August, 1776.\n\nIt is necessary I should inform you that there is at present a vacancy\nin my company, arising from the promotion of Lieut. Johnson to a\nCaptaincy in one of the new Gallies (which command, however, he has\nsince resigned for a very particular reason). As Artillery officers\nare scarce in proportion to the call for them, and as myself and my\nremaining officers sustain an extraordinary weight of duty on account\nof the present vacancy, I shall esteem it a favor, if you will be\npleased, as soon as possible, to make up my deficiency by a new\nappointment. It would be productive of much inconvenience should not\nthe inferior officers succeed in course, and from this consideration\nI doubt not you will think it proper to advance Mr. Gilleland and Mr.\nBean, and fill up the third lieutenancy with some other person. I\nwould beg the liberty _warmly_ to recommend to your attention Thomas\nThompson--now first Sergeant in my company--a man highly deserving\nof notice and preferment. He has discharged his duty in his present\nstation with uncommon fidelity, assiduity, and expertness. He is a very\ngood disciplinarian--possesses the advantage of having seen a good deal\nof service in Germany, has a tolerable share of common sense, and will\nnot disgrace the rank of an officer and gentleman. In a word, I verily\nbelieve, he will make an excellent Lieutenant, and his advancement will\nbe a great encouragement and benefit to my company in particular, and\nwill be an animating example to all men of merit to whose knowledge\nit comes. Myself and my officers will be much obliged to the Hon. the\nConvention to favor us with our commissions with all convenient speed,\nas they may be highly requisite under some circumstances that may\npossibly hereafter arise.\n\n                                          A. Hamilton,\n                                          Captain of New-York Artillery.\n\n\n\n\nLT. COL. HAMILTON TO THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.\n\n\n                                     Morristown, March 6, 1777.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIt is necessary I should inform you of the changes which have happened\nin your Company of Artillery, which should have been done long ago, had\nI not been prevented by sickness, from which I am but lately recovered.\n\nGeneral Washington has been pleased to appoint me one of his\nAids-de-Camp. Captain-Lieutenant James Moore, a promising officer,\nand who did credit to the State he belonged to, died about nine weeks\nago. Lieutenant James Gilleland, some time before that, resigned his\ncommission, prompted by domestic inconveniences, and _other_ motives\nbest known to himself. There remain now only two officers, Lieutenants\nBean and Thompson, and about thirty men. The reason that the number of\nmen is so reduced, besides death and desertions, was owing to a breach\nof orders in Lieutenant Johnson, who first began the enlistment of the\ncompany; and who, instead of engaging them during the war, according\nto the intention of the State, engaged them for the limited term of a\ntwelvemonth. The time of those enlisted by him has expired; and for\nwant of powers to re-engage them, they have mostly entered into other\ncorps.\n\nI have to request you will favor me with instructions as to your future\nintentions. If you design to retain the company on the particular\nestablishment of the State, it will be requisite to complete the number\nof officers, and make provision to have the company filled by a new\nenlistment. In this case, I should beg leave to recommend to your\nnotice, as far as a Captain-Lieutenancy, Mr. Thompson. Mr. Bean is so\nincurably addicted to a _certain failing_, that I cannot, in justice,\ngive my opinion in favor of his preferment. But if you should determine\nto resign the company, as I expect you will, considering it as an\nextraordinary burthen, without affording any special advantages, the\nContinent will readily take it off your hands, so soon as you shall\nintimate your design to relinquish it. I doubt not you will see the\npropriety of speedily deciding on the matter, which the good of the\nservice requires.\n\n                            I am, with the sincerest respect, gentlemen,\n                            Your most obât and most humble servant,\n                            Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CONVENTION TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Kingston, March 17, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are to inform you, that Robert R. Livingston is, with us, a\ncommittee appointed by Convention to correspond with you at Head\nQuarters. You will give us pleasure in the information that His\nExcellency is recovered from the illness which had seized him the day\nbefore Messrs. Cuyler and Taylor left Head Quarters. Any occurrences in\nthe army which may have happened, you will please to communicate.\n\nIn answer to your letter to the Convention, of the sixth of March\ninstant, we are to inform you, that it is determined to permit that\ncompany to join the Continental Army, for which you will take the\nnecessary steps. At the same time, you will take some notice of the\ndisposition of our guns, which, as you well know, are all in the\nContinental service; and unless some little attention is paid to them,\nwe may, perhaps, never see them again.\n\n                                   We are, Sir,\n                                   Your most obedât and humble servants,\n                                   Gouv. Morris,\n                                   Wm. Allison.\n\n\n\n\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Kingston, 26 March, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nBy unavoidable incidents, this letter is delayed beyond the usual\ntime; for which I assure you I am extremely sorry. Your favor gave\ngreat pleasure, as well to the committee as to several members of the\nHouse, who are much pleased with your judicious caution, to distinguish\nbetween what you sport as your private opinions, and the weighty\nsentiments of the General.\n\nNo circumstance could have more contributed to our happiness, than to\nhear of the Generalâs recovery; which, believe me, gave universal joy.\nBe pleased to make my most respectful compliments to his lady.\n\nThat the enemy are willing to desert, can hardly be doubted; and a\nvariety of sufficient reasons may easily be assigned.\n\nWant of success is not among the least considerable: add also the want\nof pay, the want of plunder. I think the situation of the enemy clearly\ndemonstrates the want of political wisdom, and knowledge of war, at\nthe fountain head. To pass over the succession of other blunders\nthey committed, from their attempt on Long Island to their present\ndisposition, their treatment of the soldiery is a monument of folly.\nFirst, to prevent their foreign mercenaries from deserting, they kept\nback arrearages of pay. And secondly, to prevent mutiny, and silence\nmurmurings, they allowed the plundering of a country they intend to\nconquer. Here common sense alone would have informed them, had they\nlistened to her dictates, that by irritating they would never subdue;\nand that an indulgence in excesses would relax all discipline. Taught\nby experience, they begin now to wind up the cords; but as it was said\nof James the First, they are always either too high or too low. Instead\nof liberal discipline, they ask servile obedience. Would it not be\nwise to meet this with taunting insult? To encourage our men in abuse\nof them, as poor slaves, hired without pay, yet not daring to vent a\ncomplaint; and contrast the different situations: at the same time\ninviting them to come and taste the air of freedom? The English are the\nproudest people on earth.\n\nYou will hear more of a little expedition against Peekskill at Head\nQuarters than I can tell you. I suppose it is intended as a diversion;\nif so, it is a ridiculous one.\n\n                                                  I am, &c.,\n                                                  Gouv. Morris.\n\n\n\n\nCol. Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLIVINGSTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Kingston, March 29, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nWe received your favor of the--instant, and am obliged to you not\nonly for your acceptance of a very troublesome challenge, but for the\nalacrity with which you meet us in the field. We wish it would afford\nyou as many laurels, as you are like to reap elsewhere.\n\nYou have heard of the enemyâs little excursion to Peekskill; we wish it\nmay not encourage them to make a more serious attempt: may it not be\nproper to remove the stores to a place of greater safety?\n\nWe are somewhat alarmed at accounts of the Indians having left their\nvillages; from whence many conclude, that they have hostile intentions:\nthough as they are much in our power, we cannot be entirely of this\nopinion.\n\nYour reasons for supposing that the enemy will not proceed to\nPhiladelphia till the beginning of May seem to be conclusive; are you\nequally well satisfied that they may not open their campaign by sailing\nto the northward? You have probably seen some affidavits of people who\nhad been to New-York, which were sent by Convention to his Excellency\nthe General. As this does not go by our own express, we do not care to\nrisk any thing more on this subject, which we shall treat more at large\nin our next.\n\nTime must shortly prove the truth of Mr. Franklinâs conjecture, which\nderives great credit from the several accounts we daily receive of\nthe state of Europe. You will oblige us by communicating any further\nintelligence you may have received on this subject; its importance\nrenders us solicitous about the event.\n\n                                         I am, Sir, by order,\n                                         Your most obedât humble servât,\n                                         Robert R. Livingston.\n\nCol. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CONVENTION TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Kingston, April 2, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nWe received yours of the 29th ultimo, and are extremely sorry to hear\nof your indisposition.\n\nIn our last we expressed an apprehension that the enemy might possibly\nmake Hudsonâs river their first object; not only because they could\nopen their campaign there earlier than they could go to Pennsylvania\n(as in one case their army would move by land, and in the other by\nwater); but because, having the command of the river, by taking the\nadvantage of a southerly wind, they would have it in their power to\nrun up in a few hours; and, by destroying the boats that are along its\nbanks, render it impossible for General Washingtonâs army to cross\ntill they have marched to Albany; a thing almost impracticable at this\nseason of the year, considering the distance, and badness of the roads.\nThis would enable them, not only to ravage all this State, but to enter\nConnecticut on its western side, where the disaffection of the people\nwill insure them many friends. We have strained every nerve to prepare\nfor their reception, having vested a power in General George Clinton\nto make whatever draughts he may think necessary from the militia:\nin consequence of which, every third man is ordered to be drawn\nfrom the southern, and every fifth man from the northern counties.\nWe are not without apprehensions that these heavy draughts will be\ndreadfully felt, in the want of the necessary supplies for the army\nand inhabitants, which can hardly be raised under such circumstances\nin this State: but more remote evils must yield to the pressures of\nnecessity. We inclose you, by direction of Convention, some resolutions\nlately passed, in order to render the laws against spies, and secret\nenemies, more effectual. You will be pleased to deliver them, with our\nrespectful compliments, to His Excellency the General.\n\nWe are happy to hear of the arrival of the vessel with arms from\nFrance, as no supplies can be more necessary. We flatter ourselves\nthat it will shortly be in our power to communicate more important\nintelligence from that quarter.\n\n                                 We are, with great respect, Sir,\n                                 Your most obedient and humble servants,\n                                 Wm. Allison.\n                                 Robât R. Livingston.\n                                 Gouvâr Morris.\n\nCol. Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO A COMMITTEE OF THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.\n\n\n                      Head Quarters, Morristown, April 5, 1777.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nSince my last I have had the pleasure of receiving your reply to my\ntwo favors of the 29th ultimo and 2d current. I am happy enough to be\nable to inform you, that my indisposition, which was the occasion of my\nbrevity when I last wrote, is now removed.\n\nThe opinion I advanced respecting the enemyâs not moving before the\nbeginning of May, seems to be shaken, though not entirely overthrown,\nby some present appearances. We have received information that they are\nembarking about three thousand men on board of transports, which are\nlying at the Hook, by way of Staten Island. This, it is conjectured,\nis with a view to the Delaware; and the supposition is confirmed, by\nthe circumstance of a confederacy lately detected at Philadelphia,\nwho, among other things, were endeavoring, by the temptation of\nfifty pounds, to engage persons as pilots up that river. The extreme\ndifficulties they must labor under for want of forage, and the infinite\nhazard they must run by moving with a small body of about five thousand\nmen, with an enemy in the rear, incapable of sparing any considerable\nbody of troops to form a post behind, and be an asylum to them in case\nof accident,--these circumstances will hardly allow me to think they\nwill be daring enough to make the attempt at this time. But on the\nother hand, as they know we are in a progressive state as to numbers,\nand other matters of importance, and as they have no prospect of early\nreinforcement, and are in a state of uncertainty as to any, from the\nbustling aspect of European affairs, it is probable they may conceive\na necessity of making a push at all risks. Perhaps, however, this\nembarkation is intended for some other purpose; to make a diversion,\nor execute some partisan exploit elsewhere. On the whole, I find it\ndifficult to believe they are yet ready for any capital operation.\n\nAs to your apprehensions of an attempt up the North river, I imagine\nyou may discard any uneasiness on that score, although it will be at\nall times advisable to be on the watch against such a contingency.\nIt is almost reduced to a certainty, that the principal views of the\nenemy, in the ensuing campaign, will be directed towards the southward,\nand to Philadelphia more immediately; of which idea, the discovery\nbefore mentioned, with respect to pilots, is no inconsiderable\nconfirmation. Philadelphia is an object calculated to strike and\nattract their attention. It has all along been the main source of\nsupplies towards the war; and the getting it into their possession,\nwould deprive us of a wheel we could very badly spare, in the great\npolitical and military machine. They are sensible of this, and are\nequally sensible, that it contains, in itself, and is surrounded by,\na prodigious number of persons attached to them, and inimical to us,\nwho would lend them all the assistance they could, in the further\nprosecution of their designs. It is also a common and well-grounded\nrule in war, to strike first and principally, at the capital towns and\ncities, in order to the conquest of a country.\n\nI must confess I do not see any object equally interesting to draw\ntheir efforts to the northward. Operations merely for plundering and\ndevastation can never answer their end; and if they could, one part of\nthe continent would do nearly as well as another. And as to the notion\nof forming a junction with the northern army, and cutting off the\ncommunication between the northern and southern States, I apprehend it\nwill do better in speculation than in practice. Unless the geography\nof the country is far different from any thing I can conceive, to\neffect this would require a chain of posts, and such a number of men at\neach, as would never be practicable or maintainable, but to an immense\narmy. In their progress, by hanging upon their rear, and seizing\nevery opportunity of skirmishing, their situation might be rendered\ninsupportably uneasy.\n\nBut for fear of mistake, the General has determined to collect a\nconsiderable body of troops at or about Peekskill, which will not be\ndrawn off till the intentions of the enemy have acquired a decisive\ncomplexion. These will be ready, according to conjunctures, either to\nproceed northerly or southerly, as may be requisite. Every precaution\nshould be taken to prevent the boats from being destroyed, by\ncollecting them, at the first movement of the enemy, under cover of\none of the forts, or into some inlet, difficult of access, and easily\ndefensible with a small number of men. The loss of them would be an\nirreparable disadvantage.\n\nThe enemyâs attempt upon Peekskill is a demonstration of the folly\nof having any quantity of stores at places so near the water, and so\nmuch exposed to a sudden inroad. There should never be more there than\nsufficient to answer present demands. We have lost a good deal in this\nway at different times, and I hope experience will at last make us\nwiser.\n\nHis Excellency lately had a visit from the Oneida Chief and five\nothers. He managed them with a good deal of address, and sent them\naway perfectly satisfied. He persuaded them to go to Philadelphia, but\nthey declined it, alleging their impatience to return, and remove the\nerroneous opinions of their countrymen, from the misrepresentations of\nBritish emissaries, which they were apprehensive might draw them into\nsome rash proceedings. They parted, after having made the most solemn\nprotestations of friendship and good will. His Excellency has been very\nbusy all day in dispatching the southern post, which has prevented me\ngiving him your resolve. It will, no doubt, be very acceptable; and\nit is with pleasure I inform you, that the zeal and abilities of the\nNew-York Convention hold the first rank in his estimation.\n\nNo news from France, save that the Congress have obtained a credit\nthere, for which they can draw bills to the amount of Â£100,000\nsterling. This will be extremely serviceable in carrying on a trade\nwith the French. The new troops begin to come in. If we can shortly get\nany considerable accession of strength, we may be able to strike some\nbrilliant stroke.\n\n                             I am, Gentlemen, with the greatest respect,\n                             Your most obedient servant,\n                             A. Hamilton.\n\nP. S. We have been some time endeavoring to negotiate a regular cartel;\nbut it has been lately broken off, principally on account of Major\nGeneral Lee. General Howe will not allow him to be comprehended under\nthe general idea of American prisoners.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CONVENTION TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                     Kingston, 8th April, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nYours of the third came safe to hand this day, and gave us great\npleasure by certifying your health. The smallness of our numbers\nwill not permit the loss of one useful citizen. It is, therefore, a\ndetermined point, that, sick or well, you are by no means to die.\n\nAt this distance, it is impossible to determine what the enemy can, or\nwhat they cannot, do. But, certainly, if we can bring a respectable\nforce into the field previous to their movements, it must be extremely\ndifficult for them to advance or retreat. The latter, indeed, may be\nassisted by the works they are throwing up.\n\nTheir attempt upon the Delaware is far from improbable. Howe is\ncertainly a stupid fellow: but if he reasons so far, the taking of\nPhiladelphia would give a splendid sight to their manÅuvres in the\neyes of Europe. This would be productive of advantage. The seizing that\nlarge city, would also afford him much benefit in the several ways\nwhich you suggest. But would it not be wise to permit his force to be\nthus divided, that one part after another might be cut to pieces?\n\nSince the affair at Peekskill, their views this way seem to be less\nprobable. It was, doubtless, unmilitary to warn us of our danger. They\nwill also soon learn that we are in this quarter, in a decent posture\nof defence; and that may decide their fluctuating councils.\n\nPerhaps, after all, they will find it more convenient to keep post at\nAmboy, with an advanced party at Brunswick, secure New-York, and carry\non a kind of naval partisan war, till the further aid and order of\ntheir masters.\n\nYou will take care, whenever you write to us matters which ought not\nto be seen by all, to direct to _one_ of _us_ only in a separate\nletter: while that which is merely indifferent, comes under your usual\ndirection. The reason is, that sometimes, when we do not happen to be\nimmediately in the way, your letters are opened by the President; and\nalthough no evil consequences have accrued from this as yet, it is\nnevertheless proper to guard against it.\n\nWhat you say relative to a cartel, reminds us of the case of Major\nEdminston, who was taken by General Schuyler at the same time with Sir\nJohn Johnson. This gentleman, as His Excellency will recollect, was\nsent into the enemyâs quarters, with a letter to negotiate an exchange\nfor one of three Majors, prisoners in their hands. He hath since\nreturned, with a letter from Howe to General Schuyler, purporting that\none of those Majors shall be exchanged for him, he being permitted\nto join his regiment in Canada. He was three weeks, or thereabouts,\ntravelling from New-York to Albany; of which the Convention being\ninformed, caused him to be made prisoner, and intend sending him to\nHead Quarters. He is well acquainted with the face of this country, and\nthe disposition of its several inhabitants. He has sufficient interest\nwith the Indians to accomplish an escape. Upon the whole (as it will\nnot be prudent to confine him within this State), it is submitted,\nwhether it would not be proper to secure him elsewhere until the close\nof the present campaign?\n\n                                     We are, Sir,\n                                     Your most obât and humble servants,\n                                     Robt. R. Livingston,\n                                     Gouv. Morris.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLORD STIRLING TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   Baskenridge, April 12, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe troops under Colonel McClanagan, which I expected at their quarters\nbetween the first and second mountains yesterday, I find took the\nroute by Pluckamin and lodged there last night. I sent this morning at\ndaybreak a messenger to bring them into the Boundbrook Road at Boylans.\nI understand Col. Spotswoodâs regiment is on the march by the same\nroute.\n\nThe time of Capt. James Scottâs company will expire the 14th. Lieut.\nKidgelow and the bulk of the men have behaved very well; as they can\nnow be spared, I believe it will be best that I be furnished with His\nExcellencyâs dismission of them by the day.\n\nI wrote to His Excellency on Thursday last about the appointment of\nWilcocks. If he is approved of I wish you would get both Mr. Williams\nand him in orders, and that you would be so good as to write him to\ncome to me.\n\nIf there be any thing in General Orders within these two or three days\nthat can relate to the troops here, I should be glad to have a copy of\nthem.\n\n                                        I am, very sincerely,\n                                        Your affectionate humble servt.,\n                                        Stirling.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CONVENTION TO HAMILTON\n\n\n                                    Kingston, 16th April, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nWe are directed, by Convention, to inclose a Resolution passed this\nday, in addition to that of the first of April, which we before did\nourselves the honor to transmit to His Excellency, by which we hope to\nput an effectual stop to any further desertions to the enemy; as the\ndisaffected have been hitherto greatly emboldened by their having, for\nthe want of courts, escaped the punishment they deserved. It frequently\nhappens, that ignorant young lads are seduced to enlist with the enemy,\nand are taken in their way to them. We have sometimes thought that such\nmight safely be admitted to enlist in our regiments (which they are\ngenerally inclined to do), as a change of company will often make an\nalteration in their sentiments, in which case a useful number may be\npreserved to the community. We wish you to consult the General on this\nsubject, and to favor us with his opinion, by which we shall regulate\nour future conduct relative to such persons.\n\nWe are obliged to you for communicating by Mr. Troop, an account of the\nengagement of Sunday, in which we equally admire the extreme caution\nof the enemy, and the spirit of that handful of men by whom they were\nopposed. The same bravery will, we hope, prove as fortunate, when a\nfairer occasion offers for its exertion. We have daily information of\nplots that are formed in this State; and a few days ago apprehended a\nColonel who was raising a regiment for the service of the enemy. We\nhope, by a seasonable severity, to prevent this evil from becoming very\nextensive.\n\n                                                        We are, Sir, &c.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO LIVINGSTON.\n\n\n                     Head Quarters, Morristown, April 29, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nThe inclosed was intended to be sent with the prisoners mentioned in\nthe list; but before this could be conveniently done, Mr. Sims, one\nof the Chief Justices of the State, came to this town, and informed\nme, that the Governor and Council were upon the point of adjourning;\nand that the sending of the prisoners to them, would only be an\nembarrassment, without answering, at present, any valuable purpose. He\nconsidered himself authorized to take the matter under his direction,\nand desired a sight of the papers relating to it. After perusing them,\nhe determined it was best the prisoners should remain here, until he\nshould receive your further orders on the subject; and delivered me a\nletter for you, containing a representation of their cases, as they\nappear to him, in order to know your sense, in what manner they shall\nbe disposed of.\n\nHe admits two of them, Woolverton and Silas Howel, to bail.\n\nIn addition to the former, I send you a second list of four others that\nhave been lately committed to jail. These are high offenders, and among\nthe number of those who it were to be wished could have an immediate\ntrial and punishment. Isaac Ogden, in particular, is one of the most\nbarefaced impudent fellows that ever came under my observation. He\nopenly acknowledged himself a subject of the King of Great Britain; and\nflatly refused to give any satisfaction to some questions that were\nput to him respecting one Moses Nichols, an emissary from the enemy;\nassigning no other reason for his refusal, than that he had given his\nword to be silent.\n\nA spirit of disaffection shows itself with so much boldness and\nviolence in different parts of this State, that it is the ardent wish\nof His Excellency, no delay, which can be avoided, might be used in\nmaking examples of some of the most atrocious offenders. If something\nbe not speedily done, to strike a terror into the disaffected, the\nconsequences must be very disagreeable.\n\nAmong others, all security to the friends of the American cause will\nbe destroyed; and the natural effect of this, will be an extinction of\nzeal in seconding and promoting it. Their attachment, if it remain,\nwill be a dead, inactive, useless principle. And the disaffected,\nemboldened by impunity, will be encouraged to proceed to the most\ndangerous and pernicious lengths.\n\n                             I have the honor to be, with great respect,\n                             Your Excellencyâs most obât servant,\n                             A. Hamilton, A. D. C.\n\nTo Gov. Livingston.\n\n\n\n\nHUGH KNOX TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                             St. Croix, April 31, 1777.\n\nMy Dear Friend:\n\nA pretty fair opportunity just offering for Philadelphia, I could\nnot omit acknowledging the receipt of your very circumstantial and\nsatisfactory letter of the 14th February. The thing has happened\nwhich I wished for. We have been amazed here by vague, imperfect,\nand very false accounts of matters from the Continent: and I always\ntold my friends, that if you survived the campaign, and had an hour\nof leisure to write to me, I expected a more true, circumstantial,\nand satisfactory account of matters in your letter, than by all the\npublic papers and private intelligence we had received here. I have\nbut a moment to command at present, and have not time to remark\nupon your letter. I can only inform you, that it has given high\nsatisfaction to all friends here. We rejoice in your _good character_\nand _advancement_, which is, indeed, only the just reward of merit. May\nyou still live to deserve more and more from the friends of America,\nand to justify the choice, and merit the approbation, of the GREAT AND\nGOOD GENERAL WASHINGTON--a name which will shine with distinguished\nlustre in the annals of history--a name dear to the friends of the\nLiberties of Mankind! _Mark this_: You must be the Annalist and\nBiographer, as well as the Aide-de-Camp, of General Washington--and\nthe Historiographer of the AMERICAN WAR! I take the liberty to insist\non this. I hope you take minutes and keep a Journal! If you have not\nhitherto, I pray do it henceforth. I seriously, and with all my little\ninfluence, urge this upon you. This may be a new and strange thought\nto you: but if you survive the present troubles, _I aver_--few men\nwill be as well qualified to write the history of the present glorious\nstruggle. God only knows how it may terminate. But however that may be,\nit will be a most interesting story.\n\nI congratulate you on your recovery from a long and dangerous illness.\nIt is my own case--I am just convalescent, after the severest attack\nI ever had in my life. I hope to write you more at large soon, and\nremain, with the tender of every kind and friendly wish,\n\n                                              My dear Sir,\n                                              Your affectionate servant,\n                                              Hugh Knox.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WILLIAM DUER.\n\n\n                      Head Quarters, Morristown, 6th May, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nThe bearer of this is Mr. Malmedi, a French gentleman of learning,\nabilities, and experience. I believe he thinks himself entitled\nto preferment, and comes to Congress for that purpose. At the\nrecommendation of General Lee, he was made Brigadier General by the\nState of Rhode Island; and filled the station to the satisfaction of\nhis employers, as appears by a letter from Governor Cook, speaking\nof him in the highest terms of approbation. This has led him to hope\nthat he should be adopted by the Continent on an equal footing. But\nin this he will, no doubt, be mistaken, as there are many insuperable\nobjections to such an event. Among others, it would tend to raise\nthe expectations of the Frenchmen in general, already too high, to a\npitch which it would be impossible to gratify or endure. It might not,\nhowever, be amiss to do whatever propriety would warrant to keep him\nin good humor, as he is a man of sense and merit. I think policy would\njustify the advancing him a step higher than his former Continental\nrank.\n\nCongress, in the beginning, went upon a very injudicious plan with\nrespect to Frenchmen. To every adventurer that came, without even\nthe shadow of credentials, they gave the rank of Field officers.\nThis circumstance, seconding the aspiring disposition natural to\nthose people, carried the expectations of those who had really any\npretensions to the character of officers, to a length that exceeds all\nthe bounds of moderation. As it was impossible to pursue this impolitic\nplan, the Congress have begun to retrench their excessive liberality;\nand the consequence has been, universal disgust and discontent.\n\nIt would, perhaps, be injurious, as the French are much addicted\nto national punctilio, to run into the opposite extreme to that\nfirst embraced, and, by that mean, create a general clamor and\ndissatisfaction. Policy suggests the propriety of discriminating a few\nof the most deserving, and endeavoring to keep them in temper, even by\ngratifying them beyond what they can reasonably pretend to. This will\nenable us to shake off the despicable part with safety, and to turn\na deaf ear to the exorbitant demands of the many. It will easily be\nbelieved in France that their want of merit occasioned their want of\nsuccess, from the extraordinary marks of favor that have been conferred\non others: whereas, the united voice of complaint from the whole, might\nmake ill impressions in their own country, which it is not our interest\nshould exist.\n\nWe are already greatly embarrassed with the Frenchmen among us; and,\nfrom the genius of the people, shall continue to be so. It were to be\nwished, that our agents in France, instead of courting them to come\nout, were instructed to give no encouragement but where they could\nnot help it; that is, where applications were made to them by persons\ncountenanced and supported by great men, whom it would be impolitic to\ndisoblige. Be assured, Sir, we shall never be able to satisfy them; and\nthey can be of no use to us, at least for some time. Their ignorance\nof our language; of the disposition of the people; the resources and\ndeficiencies of the country; their own habits and tempers: all these\nare disqualifications that put it out of their power to be of any real\nservice to us. You will consider what I have said entirely as my own\nsentiments, and,\n\n                                     Believe me, with great regard, Sir,\n                                     Your most obedient servant,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\nWilliam Duer, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Kingston, 16th May, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nI had the pleasure of your two favors within two days of each other,\nand am very happy to find that our form of government meets with your\napprobation. That there are faults in it is not to be wondered at, for\nit is the work of men, and of men, perhaps, not the best qualified\nfor such undertakings. I think it deficient, for the want of vigor\nin the executive; unstable, from the very nature of popular elective\ngovernments; and dilatory, from the complexity of the legislature.\n\nFor the first, I apologize by hinting the spirit which now reigns in\nAmerica, suspiciously cautious. For the second, because unavoidable.\nFor the third, because a simple legislature soon possesses itself of\ntoo much power for the safety of its subjects. God grant it may work\nwell, for we must live under it.\n\nI cannot persuade myself that Howe will either go to Philadelphia or\ncome hither. In either case, General Washington can hang upon his\nrear, and place him in the light rather of a fugitive than a conqueror.\nIf he bends his efforts this way, the Council of Safety, you may\ndepend upon it, will exert themselves to make his situation as uneasy\nas he would wish; probably more so. The spirit of the Tories, we have\ngreat reason to believe, is entirely broken in this State. If it is\nnot, it will soon be so; for they shall have a few more executions,\nthan which nothing can be more efficacious. I speak from experience:\nbut then it is necessary to disperse the victims of public justice\nthroughout different parts of the several States; for nothing but\nocular demonstration can convince these incredulous beings that we do\nreally hang them. I wish the several States would follow our example.\nPennsylvania, in particular, would experience many good effects from a\nvigorous manly executive. Adieu.\n\n                                  Your most obedient and humble servant,\n                                  Gouv. Morris.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nGOUV. MORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Kingston, 24th May, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou certainly had no reason to complain of me, for not informing you\nof the destruction of the stores at St. Johnâs. True it is, we had\na vague report of such a transaction; and we had also an account,\nfrom private persons, that the report was confirmed at Albany: but\nGeneral Gates has never done us the honor to make us acquainted with\nhis intelligence upon that subject; and therefore I was not really\nwarranted to say any thing about it. Apropos, I shall lose two beaver\nhats if our troops are not in possession of New-York by the first day\nof July next. If the enemy expect reinforcements, prudence will dictate\nto us to do something offensive as soon as possible. Would it not\nbe prudent to make several attacks at the same time? For instance,\nabout Hackensack, Bergen, or wherever else the enemy are in that\nquarter: upon Brunswick, by way of Round Brook, Bonumtown, and from the\nsouthward: upon Fort Independence in Westchester county, or against\nHarlÃ¦m: and upon Long Island, by throwing over some of the eastern\ntroops. If only one should prove successful, it would give splendor to\nour arms, and dismay the enemy. But our numbers, &c., &c., must govern\nthese things. Howe certainly cannot mean to come this way, unless he is\nconsiderably reinforced. He will, unless he is to act on the defensive.\nI hope that our Generals are very busy fortifying the passes in the\nHighlands. I fear we shall destroy many men by it when the weather\ngrows warm. Much fatigue prevents that attention to cleanliness which\nis essential to the health of soldiery. Soldiers should, in my opinion,\nbe as much exercised in the use of arms, and the various evolutions,\nas is necessary to preserve their bodies in a state of strength and\nelasticity. The rest of their time may be usefully employed in the care\nof their clothes, and collecting refreshments. I seriously believe,\nthat if two armies of thirty thousand men each, were to take the field\nin May, and the one be employed in building fortifications for three\nmonths, which the other should storm at the expiration of that term;\nthe odds would be in favor of the assailants, that the campaign would\nnot cost them as many as the enemy. But a truce to idle speculation.\nBe pleased to direct your next letter to Robert R. Livingston and\nChristopher Tapin, Esqrs., as I shall not myself be in the way to\nreceive it. We have no news here but this, that the tories are much\nhumbled, and will, I believe, be more so.\n\n                                                  Adieu. Yours,\n                                                  Gouv. Morris.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\n\n\n                   Head Quarters, Smithâs Clove, July 22, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor of the eighteenth, from Saratoga, reached me yesterday. Your\npronouncing Fort Edward, among the other forts, indefensible, surprises\nme a little, as it is entirely contrary to the representations of\nseveral gentlemen of judgment, who have had an opportunity of seeing\nand considering its situation; by whom we have been taught to believe\nthat it would be an excellent post, at least for checking and retarding\nBurgoyneâs progress. I agree with you that our principal strength in\nthe quarter you are, will be in the forests and natural strength of\nthe country, and in the want of forage, provisions, carriages, &c., in\nwhich the enemy may easily be thrown, by taking away what there are of\nthose articles, which, you observe, have never been in great abundance.\n\nI am doubtful whether Burgoyne will attempt to penetrate far, and\nwhether he will not content himself with harassing our back settlements\nby parties assisted by the savages, who, it is to be feared, will\npretty generally be tempted, by the enemyâs late successes, to\nconfederate in hostilities against us.\n\nThis doubt arises from some appearances that indicate a southern\nmovement of General Howeâs army, which, if it should really happen,\nwill certainly be a barrier against any further impressions of\nBurgoyne; for it cannot be supposed he would be rash enough to plunge\ninto the bosom of the country without an expectation of being met by\nGeneral Howe. Things must prove very adverse to us indeed, should he\nmake such an attempt and _not be ruined by it._ I confess, however,\nthat the appearances I allude to do not carry a full evidence in my\nmind; because they are opposed by others of a contradictory kind;\nand because I cannot conceive upon what principle of common sense,\nor military propriety, Howe can be running away from Burgoyne to the\nsouthward.\n\nIt is much to be wished he may, even though it should give him the\npossession of Philadelphia, which by our remoteness from it, may\nvery well happen. In this case, we may not only, if we think proper,\nretaliate, by aiming a stroke at New-York; but we may come upon him\nwith the greatest part of our collective force, to act against that\npart which is under him. We shall then be certain that Burgoyne\ncannot proceed, and that a small force of continental troops will be\nsufficient for that partisan war which he must carry on the rest of the\ncampaign.\n\nA small force will also be sufficient to garrison the posts in the\nHighlands, and prevent any danger there; so that we shall be able\nto bring nearly the whole of the continental army against Mr. Howe.\nThe advantages of this are obvious. Should he be satisfied with the\nsplendor of his acquisition, and shut himself up in Philadelphia, we\ncan ruin him by confinement. Should he leave a garrison there, and go\nforward, we can either fall upon that or his main body, diminished\nas it will be by such a measure, with our whole force. There will,\nhowever, be many disagreeable consequences attending such an event;\namongst which, the foremost is, the _depreciation of our currency_,\nwhich, from the importance in which Philadelphia is held, cannot fail\nto ensue.\n\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DR. KNOX.\n\n\n* * * This event [the evacuation of Ticonderoga[1]], redounds very\nlittle to our credit. For if the post was untenable, or required a\nlarger number of troops to defend it than could be spared for the\npurpose, it ought long ago to have been foreseen and given up. Instead\nof that, we have kept a large quantity of cannon in it, and have been\nheaping up very valuable magazines of stores and provisions, that, in\nthe critical moment of defence, are abandoned and lost. This affair\nwill be attended with several evil consequences; for besides the\nloss of our stores, which we cannot well afford, it opens a new and\neasy door by which to penetrate the northern States. It will fix the\nhitherto fluctuating disposition of the Indians in that quarter in\ntheir favor, and expose the frontiers of the adjacent country to their\ndepredations. But though it is a misfortune we have reason to lament,\nI dare say it will be regarded with you as much more important than\nit really is, and as materially endangering the success of our cause,\nwhich is by no means the case. Our opposition is at this time too well\nmatured, and has too great stability, to be shaken by an accident of\nthat kind. While we have a respectable army in the field, and resources\nto feed, clothe, and arm them, we are safe. We have had a force\nsufficient for the foregoing part of the campaign, to maintain such a\nsuperiority over the main army of the enemy as effectually to hinder\nthem from attaining any of their purposes. And, to the northward,\nwith the reinforcements sent up to succor the retreating garrison of\nTiconderoga, and the militia flocking in from New England, I think\nthere is little doubt we have by this time a force adequate to give\nMr. Burgoyne a seasonable check. One good effect will result from the\nmisfortune, which is, that it will stimulate the eastern States to\ngreater exertions than they might otherwise make.\n\nBy our last advices, the enemy were in possession of all the country\nbetween Ticonderoga and Fort George; and our army, nearly equal in\nnumber to them, were about to take post somewhere between Fort Edward\nand Saratoga.\n\nThe consequences of this northern affair will depend much upon the part\nthat Howe acts. If he were to co-operate with Burgoyne, it would demand\nour utmost efforts to counteract them. But if he should go towards the\nsouthward, all or most of the advantages of Burgoyneâs success will be\nlost. He will either be obliged to content himself with the possession\nof Ticonderoga, and the dependent fortresses, and with carrying on a\npartisan war the rest of the campaign; or he must precipitate himself\ninto certain ruin, by attempting to advance into the country with a\nvery incompetent force. Appearances lead us to suppose that Howe is\nfool enough to meditate a southern expedition; for he has now altered\nhis station at Staten Island, mentioned above, and has fallen down to\nthe Hook. Judging it morally certain that there would be a co-operation\nof the two armies, we thought it expedient to march northerly; and had\naccordingly reached within fourteen miles of New Windsor, the place\nwhere we could cross the North River without danger or interruption.\nBut this new movement of the enemyâs fleet, has induced us to return\na few miles, and make a disposition for marching southerly. We shall,\nhowever, be cautious how we proceed on that course, lest nothing more\nthan a feint is intended, to divert us from the real object.\n\nIf they go to the southward in earnest, they must have the capture\nof Philadelphia in view; for there is no other inducement. We shall\nendeavor to get there in time to oppose them; and shall have the\nprincipal part of the continental force, and a large body of spirited\nmilitia, many of them, from their services during the last campaign,\npretty well inured to arms, to make the opposition with. Yet I would\nnot have you to be much surprised if Philadelphia should fall; for the\nenemy will doubtless go there with a determination to succeed at all\nhazard; and we shall not be able to prevent them, without risking a\ngeneral action, the expediency of which will depend upon circumstances.\nIf the militia turn out with that zeal we have a right to expect, from\ntheir conduct when the enemy made their last experiment in the Jersies,\nand were supposed to be going to Philadelphia, we may do it without\nmuch inconvenience. If they fall materially short of it, we shall\nbe obliged to confine ourselves to a skirmishing opposition, which\nwe cannot expect will be effectual. It may be asked, If, to avoid a\ngeneral engagement, we give up objects of the first importance, what is\nto hinder the enemy from carrying every important point, and ruining\nus? My answer is, that our hopes are not placed in any particular city\nor spot of ground, but in the preserving a good army, furnished with\nproper necessaries, to take advantage of favorable opportunities, and\nwaste and defeat the enemy by piecemeal. Every new post they take,\nrequires a new division of their forces, and enables us to strike with\nour united force against a part of theirs: and such is their present\nsituation, that another Trenton affair will amount to a complete\nvictory on our part; for they are at too low an ebb to bear another\nstroke of the kind. Perhaps, before I may have an opportunity of\nsending this, facts will unfold what I am now endeavoring to anticipate\nby conjecture.\n\nYou will expect some animadversions on the temper and views of the\nFrench nation. I presume you are nearly as well acquainted with the\nassistance they are giving us as I am, both by their intrigues in\nforeign courts, and by supplies of every kind of warlike stores and\napparatus.\n\nIt does not admit of a doubt that they are interested to wish us\nsuccess; and their conduct plainly shows, they are willing to give us\nevery aid essential to our preservation. But it is natural they should\ndesire to do it with as much convenience to themselves as they can.\nI apprehend they are not over fond of plunging themselves into a war\nwith England if they can avoid it, and still answer the end they have\nto pursue: and, indeed, from the evident reluctance shown on the part\nof the latter, to do any thing that may bring about such an event, it\nbecomes extremely difficult to draw her into it. The conclusion we may\nmake, is, that France will not wish to force England into a war, unless\nshe finds our affairs require it absolutely; and England will not enter\ninto one, till she is compelled to do it.\n\nMy best respects to all friends; and I beg you will believe me to be,\nwith unabated regard,\n\n                                             Dear Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\n\n[1] July 5, 1777.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n\n                                                         Sept. 18, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nIf Congress have not left Philadelphia, they ought to do it immediately\nwithout fail; for the enemy have the means of throwing a party this\nnight into the city. I just now passed the Valley Ford--in doing which\na party of the enemy came down and fired upon us in the boat, by which\nmeans I lost my horse--one man was killed, and another wounded. The\nboats were abandoned, and will fall into their hands. I did all I could\nto prevent this, but to no purpose.\n\n                                        I have the honor to be,\n                                        With much respect,\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\nTo Hon. John Hancock.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JOHN HANCOCK, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n\n                                 September 18, 1777, 9 oâclock at night.\n\nSir:\n\nI did myself the honor to write you a hasty line this evening, giving\nit as my opinion, that the city was no longer a place of safety for\nyou. I write you again, lest that letter should not get to hand. The\nenemy are on the road to Swedes Ford, the main body about four miles\nfrom it. They sent a party this evening to Daviserâs ferry, which\nfired upon me and some others in crossing it, killed one man, wounded\nanother, and disabled my horse.\n\nThey came on so suddenly, that one boat was left adrift on the other\nside, which will of course fall into their hands; and, by the help of\nthat, they will get possession of another, which was abandoned by those\nwho had the direction of it, and left afloat, in spite of every thing\nthat I could do to the contrary. These two boats will convey fifty men\nacross at a time, so that in a few hours they may throw over a large\nparty, perhaps sufficient to overmatch the militia who may be between\nthem and the city. This renders the situation of Congress extremely\nprecarious, if they are not on their guard: my apprehensions for them\nare great, though it is not improbable they may not be realized. The\nmost cogent reasons oblige me to join the army this night, or I should\nhave waited upon you myself. I am in hopes our army will be up with the\nenemy before they pass Schuylkill: if they are, something serious will\nensue.\n\n                                                I have the honor to be,\n                                                With much respect,\n                                                Sir, your most obedient,\n                                                A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n\n                             Philadelphia, 22d September, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nI left camp last evening, and came to this city to superintend the\ncollection of blankets and clothing for the army. Mr. Lovell sends to\ninform me there is an express going off to Congress; and I do myself\nthe honor to communicate a brief state of things when I left camp. The\nenemy moved yesterday, from where they lay opposite to Valley Forge,\n&c., higher up the river, on their old scheme of gaining our right. I\ndonât know precisely where they halted; but our army was preparing to\nmove up also, to counteract them.\n\nI am this morning told, they marched about twelve oâclock at night for\nthat purpose. The general opinion was, that the enemy would attempt\ncrossing this day: every appearance justified the supposition.\n\nWe had intelligence that the enemy had, the night before last,\nsurprised Generals Smallwood and Wayne, and consequently dispersed\nthem, after a small opposition. The loss, it is said, was not great:\nand our troops were re-assembling fast at the Red Lion. This seems to\nhave been a bad look out, and is somewhat disconcerting.\n\nBy a letter from General McDougal, received this morning, it appears he\nwas, on the twentieth, in the morning, at Second River, just setting\nout on his march toward Woodbridge. He is pressing forward with all\npossible expedition. The troops were pretty well refreshed, and in good\nspirits.\n\n                                                   I have, &c.,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n           Head Quarters, Philadelphia County, 30th Oct., 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt having been judged expedient by the members of a council of war,\nheld yesterday, that one of the gentlemen of my family should be sent\nto General Gates, in order to lay before him the state of this army,\nand the situation of the enemy; and to point out to him the many happy\nconsequences that will accrue from an immediate reinforcement being\nsent from the northern army; I have thought it proper to appoint you to\nthat duty, and desire that you will immediately set out for Albany; at\nwhich place, or in the neighborhood, I imagine you will find General\nGates.\n\nYou are so fully acquainted with the principal points on which you\nare sent, namely, the state of our army, and the situation of the\nenemy, that I shall not enlarge on those heads. What you are chiefly\nto attend to, is to point out, in the clearest and fullest manner, to\nGeneral Gates, the absolute necessity that there is for his detaching\na very considerable part of the army at present under his command, to\nthe reinforcement of this; a measure that will, in all probability,\nreduce General Howe to the same situation in which General Burgoyne now\nis, should he attempt to remain in Philadelphia without being able to\nremove the obstructions in the Delaware, and open a free communication\nwith his shipping. The force which the members of the council of war\njudge it safe and expedient to draw down at present, are the three New\nHampshire and fifteen Massachusetts regiments, with Leeâs and Jacksonâs\ntwo of the sixteen, additional. But it is more than probable that\nGeneral Gates may have detained part of those troops to the reduction\nof Ticonderoga, should the enemy not have evacuated it; or to the\ngarrisoning it. If they should, in that case the reinforcement will\nbe according to circumstances; but, if possible, let it be made up to\nthe same number out of other corps. If, upon your meeting with General\nGates, you should find that he intends, in consequence of his success,\nto employ the troops under his command upon some expedition, by the\nprosecution of which the common cause will be more benefited than by\ntheir being sent down to reinforce this army, it is not my wish to\ngive any interruption to the plan. But if he should have nothing more\nin contemplation than those particular objects which I have mentioned\nto you, and which it is unnecessary to commit to paper; in that case\nyou are to inform him, that it is my desire that the reinforcements\nbefore mentioned, or such parts of them as can be safely spared, be\nimmediately put in motion to join the army.\n\nI have understood that General Gates has already detached Nixonâs\nand Gloverâs brigades to join General Putnam; and General Dickinson\ninforms me, Sir Henry Clinton has come down the river with his whole\nforce: if this be a fact, you are to desire General Putnam to send the\ntwo brigades forward with the greatest expedition, as there can be no\noccasion for them there.\n\nI expect you will meet Colonel Morganâs corps upon their way down:\nif you do, let them know how essential their services are to us; and\ndesire the Colonel or commanding officer, to hasten their march as much\nas is consistent with the health of the men after their late fatigues.\n\n                                                                   G. W.\n\nP.S. I ordered the detachment belonging to General McDougalâs division\nto come forward. If you meet them, direct those belonging to Greeneâs,\nAngelâs, Chandlerâs, and Duryeeâs regiments, not to cross Delaware, but\nto proceed to Red Bank.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                        Fishkill, Nov. 2, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI lodged last night in the neighborhood of New Windsor. This morning\nearly I met Colonel Morgan with his corps, about a mile from it, in\nmarch for head quarters. I told him the necessity of making all the\ndispatch he could, so as not to fatigue his men too much, which he has\npromised to do.\n\nI understood from Colonel Morgan, that all the northern army were\nmarching down on both sides the river, and would, probably, be\nto-morrow at New Windsor and this place; and that General Putnam had\nheld a council for the general disposition of them, in which it was\nresolved to send you four thousand men, and to keep the rest on this\nside the river. I came here in expectation that matters were in such\na train as to enable me to accomplish my errand without going any\nfurther, unless it should be to hasten the troops that were on their\nmarch: but on my arrival, I learned from Mr. Hughes, an Aid-de-Camp of\nGeneral Gates, that the following disposition of the northern army had\ntaken place.\n\nGeneral Pattersonâs, Gloverâs, and Nixonâs brigades, and Colonel\nWarnerâs mountain boys, to remain in and about Albany: barracks\nbuilding for them. General Poorâs brigade, marching down this side of\nthe river to join General Putnam, will be here probably to-morrow.\nGeneral Learnedâs brigade, Morganâs corps, Warnerâs brigade of\nMassachusetts militia, and some regiments of New-York militia, on their\nmarch on the west side of the river.\n\nI have directed General Putnam, in your name, to send forward, with\nall dispatch, to join you, the two continental brigades, and Warnerâs\nmilitia brigade: this last is to serve till the latter end of this\nmonth. Your instructions did not comprehend any militia: but as there\nare certain accounts here, that most of the troops from New-York\nare gone to reinforce General Howe; and as so large a proportion of\ncontinental troops have been detained at Albany; I concluded you would\nnot disapprove of a measure calculated to strengthen you, though but\nfor a small time, and have ventured to adopt it on that presumption.\n\nBeing informed by General Putnam, that General Wynds, with seven\nhundred Jersey militia, was at Kingâs Ferry, with intention to cross to\nPeekskill, I prevailed upon him to relinquish that idea, and send off\nan immediate order for them to march towards Red Bank. It is possible,\nhowever, unless your Excellency supports this order by an application\nfrom yourself, he may march his men home, instead of marching them to\nthe place he has been directed to repair to.\n\nNeither Leeâs, Jacksonâs regiments, nor the detachments belonging to\nGeneral McDougalâs division, have yet marched. I have urged their being\nsent; and an order has been dispatched for their instantly proceeding.\nColonel Hughes is pressing some fresh horses for me. The moment they\nare ready, I shall recross the river, in order to fall in with the\ntroops on the other side, and make all the haste I can to Albany, to\nget the three brigades there sent forward.\n\nWill your Excellency permit me to observe, that I have some doubts,\nunder present circumstances and appearances, of the propriety of\nleaving the regiments proposed to be left in this quarter? But if my\ndoubts on this subject were stronger than they are, I am forbid, by the\nsense of council, from interfering in the matter.\n\nGeneral Poorâs brigade is just arrived here: they will proceed to join\nyou with all expedition. So strongly am I impressed with the importance\nof endeavoring to crush Mr. Howe, that I am apt to think it would\nbe advisable to draw off all the continental troops. Had this been\ndetermined on, General Warnerâs sixteen hundred militia might have been\nleft here.\n\n                                I have the honor to be,\n                                With the warmest esteem and respect,\n                                Your Excellencyâs most obedient servant,\n                                A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                        Albany, November, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI arrived here yesterday at noon, and waited upon General Gates\nimmediately, on the business of my mission; but was sorry to find that\nhis ideas did not correspond with yours, for drawing off the number of\ntroops you directed. I used every argument in my power, to convince\nhim of the propriety of the measure; but he was inflexible in the\nopinion, that two brigades, at least, of continental troops, should\nremain in and near this place. His reasons were, that the intelligence\nof Sir Henry Clintonâs having gone to join Howe, was not sufficiently\nauthenticated to put it out of doubt; that there was, therefore, a\npossibility of his returning up the river, which might expose the\nfinest arsenal in America (as he calls the one here) to destruction,\nshould this place be left so bare of troops as I proposed; and that\nthe want of conveniencies, and the difficulty of the roads, would make\nit impossible to remove artillery and stores for a considerable time;\nthat the New England States would be left open to the depredations\nand ravages of the enemy; that it would put it out of his power to\nenterprise any thing against Ticonderoga, which he thinks might be done\nin the winter, and which he considers it of importance to undertake.\n\nThe force of these reasons did by no means strike me; and I did every\nthing in my power to show they were unsubstantial: but all I could\neffect, was to have one brigade dispatched, in addition to those\nalready marched. I found myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a\nloss how to act. I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as\npossible: but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconveniences,\nin acting diametrically opposite to the opinion of a gentleman, whose\nsuccesses have raised him to the highest importance. General Gates has\nwon the entire confidence of the Eastern States. If disposed to do it,\nby addressing himself to the prejudices of the people, he would find\nno difficulty to render a measure odious, which it might be said,\nwith plausibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose them\nto unnecessary dangers, notwithstanding their exertions, during the\ncampaign, had given them the fullest title to repose and security.\nGeneral Gates has influence and interest elsewhere: he might use it,\nif he pleased, to discredit the measure there also. On the whole, it\nappeared to me dangerous, to insist on sending more troops from hence,\nwhile General Gates appeared so warmly opposed to it. Should any\naccident, or inconvenience, happen in consequence of it, there would be\ntoo fair a pretext for censure: and many people are too well disposed\nto lay hold of it. At any rate, it might be considered as using him\nill, to take a step so contrary to his judgment, in a case of this\nnature. These considerations, and others which I shall be more explicit\nin when I have the pleasure of seeing you, determined me not to insist\nupon sending either of the other brigades remaining here. I am afraid\nwhat I have done, may not meet with your approbation, as not being\nperhaps fully warranted by your instructions: but I ventured to do what\nI thought right, hoping that, at least, the goodness of my intention\nwill excuse the error of my judgment.\n\nI was induced to this relaxation the more readily, as I had directed\nto be sent on, two thousand militia, which were not expected by you;\nand a thousand continental troops out of those proposed to be left\nwith General Putnam, which I have written to him, since I found how\nmatters were circumstanced here, to forward to you with all dispatch.\nI did this for several reasons: because your reinforcement would be\nmore expeditious from that place than from this: because two thousand\ncontinental troops at Peekskill will not be wanted in its present\ncircumstances; especially as it was really necessary to have a body\nof continental troops at this place, for the security of the valuable\nstores here: and I should not, if I had my wish, think it expedient to\ndraw off more than two of the three brigades now here. This being the\ncase, one of the ends you proposed to be answered, by leaving the ten\nregiments with General Putnam, will be equally answered by the troops\nhere; I mean that of covering and fortifying the Eastern States: and\none thousand continental troops in addition to the militia collected,\nand that may be collected, here, will be sufficient, in the Highlands,\nfor covering the country down that way, and carrying on the works\nnecessary to be raised for the defence of the river.\n\nThe troops gone, and going, to reinforce you, are near five thousand\nrank and file, continental troops; and two thousand five hundred\nMassachusetts and New Hampshire militia. These and the seven hundred\nJersey militia, will be a larger reinforcement than you expected,\nthough not quite an equal number of continental troops; nor exactly\nin the way directed. General Lincoln tells me, the militia are very\nexcellent; and though their time will be out by the last of this month,\nyou will be able, if you think proper, to order the troops still\nremaining here, to join you by the time their term of service expires.\n\nI cannot forbear being uneasy, lest my conduct should prove displeasing\nto you: but I have done what, considering all circumstances, appeared\nto me most eligible and prudent.\n\nVessels are preparing to carry the brigade to New Windsor, which will\nembark this evening. I shall, this afternoon, set out on my return to\ncamp; and on my way, shall endeavor to hasten the troops forward.\n\n                                          I have the honor to be,\n                                          With great esteem and respect,\n                                          Your Excellencyâs most obât,\n                                          Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GATES.\n\n\n                                      Albany, November 5, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nBy inquiry, I have learned that General Pattersonâs brigade, which is\nthe one you propose to send, is by far the weakest of the three now\nhere, and does not consist of more than about six hundred rank and file\nfit for duty. It is true, that there is a militia regiment with it of\nabout two hundred; but the time of service for which this regiment is\nengaged, is so near expiring, that it would be past by the time the\nmen could arrive at their destination.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I cannot consider it either as compatible\nwith the good of the service, or my instructions from His Excellency\nGeneral Washington, to consent that that brigade be selected from the\nthree to go to him; but I am under the necessity of desiring, by virtue\nof my orders from him, that one of the others be substituted instead of\nthis; either General Nixonâs, or General Gloverâs; and that you will be\npleased to give immediate orders for its embarkation.\n\nKnowing that General Washington wished me to pay the greatest deference\nto your judgment, I ventured so far to deviate from the instructions\nhe gave me, as to consent, in compliance with your opinion, that two\nbrigades should remain here instead of one. At the same time permit me\nto observe, that I am not myself sensible of the expediency of keeping\nmore than one, with the detached regiments in the neighborhood of this\nplace; and that my ideas coincide with those gentlemen whom I have\nconsulted on the occasion, whose judgment I have much more reliance\nupon than on my own, and who must be supposed to have a thorough\nknowledge of all the circumstances. Their opinion is, that one brigade,\nand the regiments before mentioned, would amply answer the purposes of\nthis post. When I preferred your opinion to other considerations, I did\nnot imagine you would pitch upon a brigade little more than half as\nlarge as the others: and finding this to be the case, I indispensably\nowe it to my duty, to desire, in His Excellencyâs name, that another\nmay go instead of the one intended, and without loss of time. As it may\nbe conducive to dispatch, to send Gloverâs brigade, if agreeable to\nyou, you will give orders accordingly.\n\n                                        I have the honor to be,\n                                        With real respect and esteem,\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\nGeneral Gates.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                              New Windsor, November 10th, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI arrived here last night from Albany. Having given General Gates a\nlittle time to recollect himself, I renewed my remonstrances on the\nnecessity and propriety of sending you more than one brigade of the\nthree he had detained with him; and finally prevailed upon him to give\norders for Gloverâs in addition to Pattersonâs brigade, to march this\nway.\n\nAs it was thought conducive to expedition, to send the troops by water,\nas far as it could be done, I procured all the vessels that could\nbe had at Albany, fit for the purpose; but could not get more than\nsufficient to take Pattersonâs brigade. It was embarked the seventh\ninstant; but the wind has been contrary: they must probably be here\nto-day. General Gloverâs brigade marched at the same time, on the east\nside of the river, the roads being much better than on this side. I am\nat this moment informed, that one sloop, with a part of Pattersonâs,\nhas arrived, and that the others are in sight. They will immediately\nproceed, by water, to Kingâs Ferry, and thence take the shortest route.\n\nI am pained beyond expression to inform your Excellency, that on my\narrival here, I find every thing has been neglected and deranged by\nGeneral Putnam; and that the two brigades, Poorâs and Learnedâs, still\nremain here and on the other side of the river at Fishkill. Colonel\nWarnerâs militia, I am told, have been drawn to Peekskill, to aid in\nan expedition against New-York, which, it seems, is, at this time, the\nhobby-horse with General Putnam. Not the least attention has been paid\nto my order, in your name, for a detachment of one thousand men from\nthe troops hitherto stationed at this post. Every thing is sacrificed\nto the whim of taking New-York.\n\nThe two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, would not march for\nwant of money and necessaries; several of the regiments having received\nno pay for six or eight months past. There has been a high mutiny among\nthe former on this account, in which a captain killed a man, and was\nhimself shot by his comrade. These difficulties, for want of proper\nmanagement, have stopped the troops from proceeding. Governor Clinton\nhas been the only man who has done any thing towards removing them; but\nfor want of General Putnamâs co-operation, has not been able to effect\nit. He has only been able to prevail with Learnedâs brigade, to agree\nto march to Goshen; in hopes, by getting them once on the go, to induce\nthem to continue their march. On coming here, I immediately sent for\nColonel Bailey, who now commands Learnedâs brigade, and persuaded him\nto engage to carry the brigade on to head quarters as fast as possible.\nThis he expects to effect by means of five or six thousand dollars,\nwhich Governor Clinton was kind enough to borrow for me, and which\nColonel Bailey thinks will keep the men in good humor till they join\nyou. They marched this morning towards Goshen.\n\nI shall, as soon as possible, see General Poor, and do every thing in\nmy power to get him along; and hope I shall be able to succeed.\n\nThe plan I before laid, having been totally deranged, a new one has\nbecome necessary. It is now too late to send Warnerâs militia; by the\ntime they reached you, their term of service would be out. The motive\nfor sending them, which was to give you a speedy reinforcement, has, by\nthe past delay, been superseded.\n\nBy Governor Clintonâs advice, I have sent an order, in the most\nemphatical terms, to General Putnam, immediately to dispatch all the\ncontinental troops under him to your assistance; and to detain the\nmilitia instead of them.\n\nMy opinion is, that the only present use for troops in this quarter,\nis, to protect the country from the depredations of little plundering\nparties; and for carrying on the works necessary for the defence of the\nriver. Nothing more ought to be thought of. âTis only wasting time, and\nmisapplying men, to employ them in a suicidal parade against New-York:\nfor in this it will undoubtedly terminate. New-York is no object, if\nit could be taken: and to take it, would require more men than could\nbe spared from more substantial purposes. Governor Clintonâs ideas\ncoincide with mine. He thinks that there is no need of more continental\ntroops here, than a few to give a spur to the militia in working upon\nthe fortifications. In pursuance of this I have given the directions\nbefore mentioned. If General Putnam attends to them, the troops under\nhim may be with you nearly as early as any of the others (though he\nhas, unluckily, marched them down to Tarrytown); and General Gloverâs\nbrigade, when it gets up, will be more than sufficient to answer the\ntrue end of this post.\n\nIf your Excellency agrees with me in opinion, it will be well to send\ninstant directions to General Putnam, to pursue the object I have\nmentioned: for I doubt whether he will attend to any thing I shall say,\nnotwithstanding it comes in the shape of a positive order. I fear,\nunless you interpose, the works here will go on so feebly, for want of\nmen, that they will not be completed in time: whereas, it appears to me\nof the greatest importance they should be pushed with the utmost vigor.\nGovernor Clinton will do every thing in his power. I wish General\nPutnam was recalled from the command of this post, and Governor Clinton\nwould accept it: the blunders and caprices of the former are endless.\nBelieve me, Sir, nobody can be more impressed with the importance of\nforwarding the reinforcements coming to you, with all speed; nor could\nany body have endeavored to promote it more than I have done: but the\n_ignorance_ of some, and the _design_ of others, have been almost\ninsuperable obstacles. I am very unwell; but I shall not spare myself\nto get things immediately in a proper train; and for that purpose\nintend, unless I receive other orders from you, to continue with the\ntroops in the progress of their march. As soon as I get General Poorâs\nbrigade in march, I shall proceed to General Putnamâs at Peekskill.\n\n                                                I have, &c.,\n                                                Alex. Hamilton.\n\nHis Excellency, General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                New Windsor, November 12, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been detained here these two days by a fever, and violent\nrheumatic pains throughout my body. This has prevented my being\nactive, in person, for promoting the purposes of my errand; but I have\ntaken every other method in my power, in which Governor Clinton has\nobligingly given me all the aid he could. In answer to my pressing\napplication to General Poor, for the immediate marching of his brigade,\nI was told they were under an operation for the itch; which made it\nimpossible for them to proceed till the effects of it were over. By\na letter, however, of yesterday, General Poor informs me, he would\ncertainly march this morning. I must do him the justice to say, he\nappears solicitous to join you; and that I believe the past delay is\nnot owing to any fault of his, but is wholly chargeable on General\nPutnam. Indeed, Sir, I owe it to the service to say, that every part\nof this gentlemanâs conduct is marked with blunder and negligence, and\ngives general disgust.\n\nParsonsâ brigade will join you, I hope, in five or six days from this.\nLearnedâs may do the same. Poorâs will, I am persuaded, make all the\nhaste they can for the future. And Gloverâs may be expected at Fishkill\nto-night; whence they will be pressed forward as fast as I can have any\ninfluence to make them go. But I am sorry to say, the disposition for\nmarching, in the officers and men in general, of these troops, does not\nkeep pace with my wishes, or the exigency of the occasion. They have,\nunfortunately, imbibed an idea, that they have done their part of the\nbusiness of the campaign, and are now entitled to repose. This, and the\nwant of pay, make them averse to a long march at this advanced season.\n\n* * * In a letter from General Putnam, just now received by Governor\nClinton, he appears to have been, the 10th instant, at Kingâs Street,\nat the White Plains. I have had no answer to my last applications. The\nenemy appear to have stripped New-York very bare. The people there,\nthat is, the tories, are in a great fright: this adds to my anxiety,\nthat the reinforcements from this quarter to you are not in greater\nforwardness and more considerable.\n\nI have written to General Gates, informing him of the accounts of the\nsituation of New-York with respect to troops, and the probability of\nthe force gone to Howe being greater than was at first expected; to\ntry if this will not _extort_ from him a further reinforcement. I\ndonât, however, expect much from him; as he pretends to have in view an\nexpedition against Ticonderoga, to be undertaken in the winter: and he\nknows that, under the sanction of this idea, calculated to catch the\neastern people, he may, without censure, retain the troops. And as I\nshall be under a necessity of speaking plainly to your Excellency, when\nI have the pleasure of seeing you, I shall not hesitate to say, I doubt\nwhether you would have had a man from the northern army, if the whole\ncould have been kept at Albany with any decency. Perhaps you will think\nme blamable in not having exercised the powers you gave me, and given a\npositive order. Perhaps I have been so: but, deliberately weighing all\ncircumstances, I did not, and do not, think it advisable to do it.\n\n                                    I have the honor to be,\n                                    With unfeigned esteem and regard,\n                                    Your Excellencyâs most obât servant,\n                                    A. Hamilton.\n\nHis Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GATES.\n\n\n                                   Fishkill, November 12, 1777.\n\nSir:\n\nEver since my arrival in this quarter, I have been endeavoring to\ncollect the best idea I could of the state of things in New-York, in\norder the better to form a judgment of the probable reinforcement gone\nto General Howe. On the whole, this is a fact well ascertained, that\nNew-York has been stripped as bare as possible: that in consequence of\nthis, the few troops there, and the inhabitants, are under so strong\napprehensions of an attack, as almost to amount to a _panic_; that to\nsupply the deficiency of men, every effort is making to excite the\ncitizens to arms for the defence of the city. For this purpose, the\npublic papers are full of addresses to them, that plainly speak the\napprehensions prevailing on the occasion.\n\nHence I infer, that a formidable force is gone to General Howe. The\ncalculations made by those who have had the best opportunities of\njudging, carry the number from six to seven thousand. If so, the number\ngone, and going, to General Washington, is far inferior; five thousand\nat the utmost. The militia were all detained by General Putnam till it\nbecame too late to send them.\n\nThe state of things I gave you when I had the pleasure of seeing you,\nwas, to the best of my knowledge, sacredly true. I give you the present\ninformation, that you may decide, whether any further succor can with\npropriety come from you.\n\nThe fleet, with the troops on board, sailed out of the Hook on the\nfifth instant. This circumstance demonstrates, beyond the possibility\nof doubt, that it is General Howeâs fixed intention to endeavor to hold\nPhiladelphia at all hazards; and removes all danger of any further\noperations up the North River this winter. Otherwise, Sir Henry\nClintonâs movement, at this advanced season, is altogether inexplicable.\n\nIf you can with propriety afford any further assistance, the most\nexpeditious manner of conveying it will be to acquaint General Putnam\nof it, that he may send on the troops with him, to be replaced by\nthem. You, Sir, best know the uses to which the troops with you are\nto be applied, and will determine accordingly. I am certain it is not\nHis Excellencyâs wish to frustrate any plan you may have in view for\nthe benefit of the service, so far as it can possibly be avoided,\nconsistent with a due attention to more important objects.\n\n                                       I am, with respect, Sir,\n                                       Your most obedient servant,\n                                       Alex. Hamilton, A. D. C.\n\nTo General Gates.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n                                      Peekskill, Nov. 15, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI arrived at this place last night, and unfortunately find myself\nunable to proceed any further. Imagining I had gotten the better of my\ncomplaint, which confined me at Governor Clintonâs, and anxious to be\nabout attending to the march of the troops, the day before yesterday I\ncrossed the ferry, in order to fall in with General Gloverâs brigade,\nwhich was on its march from Poughkeepsie to Fishkill. I did not,\nhowever, see it myself, but received a letter from Colonel Shepherd,\nwho commands the frigate, informing me he would be last night at\nFishkill, and this night at Kingâs ferry. Wagons, &c., are provided\non the other side for his accommodation; so that there need be no\ndelay but what is voluntary; and I believe Colonel Shepherd is as\nwell disposed as could be wished to hasten his march. General Poorâs\nbrigade crossed the ferry the day before yesterday. Two York regiments,\nCourtlandâs and Livingstonâs, are with them: they were unwilling to be\nseparated from the brigade, and the brigade from them. General Putnam\nwas unwilling to keep them with him: and if he had consented to do it,\nthe regiments to displace them would not join you six days as soon as\nthese. The troops now remaining with General Putnam will amount to\nabout the number you intended, though they are not exactly the same.\nHe has detached Colonel Charles Webbâs regiment to you. He _says_ the\ntroops with him are not in a condition to march, being destitute of\nshoes, stockings, and other necessaries: but I believe the true reasons\nof his being unwilling to pursue the mode pointed out by you, were his\naversion to the York troops, and his desire to retain General Parsons\nwith him.\n\n                                     I am, with much respect and esteem,\n                                     Your Excellencyâs most obât servât,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\nTo General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                              Head-Quarters, November 15, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have duly received your several favors, from the time you left me to\nthat of the twelfth instant. I approve entirely of all the steps you\nhave taken; and have only to wish, that the exertions of those you have\nhad to deal with, had kept pace with your zeal and good intentions. I\nhope your health will, before this, have permitted you to push on the\nrear of the whole reinforcement beyond New Windsor. Some of the enemyâs\nships have arrived in the Delaware; but how many have troops on board,\nI cannot exactly ascertain. The enemy have lately damaged Fort Miflin\nconsiderably: but our people keep possession, and seem determined to do\nso to the last extremity. Our loss in men has been but small. Captain\nTreat is unfortunately among the killed. I wish you a safe return,\n\n                                             And am, dear Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             G. Washington.\n\nLt. Col. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHUGH KNOX TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                  St. Croix, December 10, 1777.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nThe fine, impartial, laconic, and highly descriptive account you\nfavored me with of the last yearâs campaign, in your letter of March\nlast, excited in me, and many of your other friends here, an earnest\ndesire of further accounts from your pen, of the succeeding fortunes\nof the Great American War: a war which will, one day, shine more\nillustriously in the historic page, than any which has happened since\nthe times of Nimrod and the Giants; and deservedly, on account of\nthe goodness of the cause, the grandeur of the object, the eclat of\nthe Generals, the bravery of the troops--and (alas! that I should be\nobliged to add) of the cruelty and ferocity which has marked the route\nof your enemies; and the tons of brothersâ blood which have been shed\non the unhappy occasion!\n\nI wrote two answers to your obliging letter, both of which I hope have\nreached you; and in both of which I have urged it upon you, to make and\ncollect such memoirs as the urgency of your affairs will permit you;\nwhich may furnish materials for an accurate history of the war, when\nyou shall have leisure to fill up and embellish such a skeleton, with\nall that elegance and dignity of which your fine pen is capable.\n\nThe honorable post you hold under the GREAT General Washington, and so\nnear his person, will give you a peculiar advantage for delineating\nhis character, both in his amiable private virtues, and military\nabilities. And depend upon it, the very minutiÃ¦ of that incomparable\nman will be read with avidity by posterity. You know me too well, I\nhope, to suspect me of superstition; yet I feel myself, at times,\nunder a strong impulse to _prophesy_, that _Washington_ was born for\nthe deliverance of America--that that Providence who has raised and\ntrained him up for that very purpose, will watch over his _sacred_ life\nwith a paternal and solicitous care; will shield his head in every\nday of battle--_will_ give him to see America _free_, _flourishing_,\nand _happy_--and _will_ adorn his fame, among latest posterity, with\na Garland of Laurel, more verdant, blooming, and enviable, than ever\nadorned the brow of a _Marlborough_!\n\nThe bearer of this line (if he should be indeed so fortunate as to put\nit into your hand) is our worthy friend, Mr. Cornelius Durant, who is\npossessed of an ardent desire of having the honor of a short interview\nwith General Washington; principally, that he may have it to say, that\nhe has seen and spoken to _the greatest man of this Age_: and, indeed,\nconsidering Mr. Durantâs personal worth; his uncommon zeal for, and\nattachment to, the American cause; the losses he has sustained in\nattempting to assist her; and his extraordinary admiration of, and love\nto, the Generalâs character and person; few men more richly merit this\nindulgence. If you still exist, and exist near the Generalâs person\n(and I have not yet seen your name among the lists of the slain or the\ndisgraced), you can easily procure him this honor--and I trust you will.\n\nWe are now blessed with, and certified of, the glorious news of\nBurgoyneâs surrender to the immortal Gates; another bright\nstar in the Constellation of American Heroes: and we are momently\nexpecting to hear, that General Washington has done something like\nthe same by General Howe! But we yet tremble in suspense--and it is\nindeed a _painful one_. Probably before this letter goes, we shall hear\nmore of the matter. Our general accounts are favorable: and while the\n_Chevaux de frize_ are defended, we have no fears about Philadelphia.\nMay this campaign decide the matter!\n\nBy the time this reaches you, you will be (if you are at all) in winter\nquarters; and perhaps may be at leisure to write me a half folio, of\nwhich Mr. Durant will take care to write me duplicates or triplicates,\nfor fear of miscarriage.\n\nA piece of mine, entitled âAn Address to America, by a friend in a\nforeign government,â has been sent to the Congress for publication\n(if approved). I know not yet its fate. It is, at least, an honestly\ndesigned and animating piece, but written incorrectly, and in a hurry.\nIf you have seen it, pray give me your sentiments about it; but let it\nbe on a loose paper inclosed in your letter; for the knowledge of my\nbeing the author must be a profound secret here.\n\nMy wishes are, that the God of Armies may defend and protect you,\nand cause you happily to survive, and to hand down to posterity the\npresent important scenes. Numbers here esteem you, and would join me in\ndeclaring themselves, as I do,\n\n                              Dear Hamilton,\n                              Your ever affectionate friend and servant,\n                              Hugh Knox.\n\n\n\n\nCLINTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                             Poughkeepsie, 28th December, 1777.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was favored with the receipt of your letter of the 22d instant,\nsome days since, and returned a short answer to it by the express who\nbrought it; but as I have reason to believe you had left Peekskill\nbefore he got there, I conclude my letter has not been received. I\nhave not a doubt but that there have been such unjust and dishonorable\npractices committed on the inhabitants as you mention; nor have I\nreason to believe they were without the knowledge of the commanding\nofficer of the Department. Complaints have been exhibited to him of\ncattle, the property of the inhabitants of this State, living near\nCol. Robinsonâs, being drove off by parties of the continental troops,\nand sold at vendue in New England, without any account being rendered\nto the proprietors; and, if I am rightly informed, an officer with\na party, took sundry articles from Robinsonâs, sent them off and\nsold them in like manner in Connecticut, and has not accounted with\nthe States for the proceeds. Of this I informed General Putnam, and\ndesired that an inquiry might be made into the conduct of the officer\ncommanding the party, to which I was more particularly induced, as\nI found he had given an order on the Quarter-Master General for the\npayment of the teams employed in carrying off those effects; but I have\nreason to believe he has had no regard to my request. Of this I am\nfully convinced, that the soldiery claim as lawful prize every thing\nthey take within the enemyâs lines, though the property of our best\nfriends, and whatever is taken beyond our advanced posts, by a generous\nconstruction, comes within the above predicament. On this principle\nthe several articles taken at and near Robinsonâs were sold because\nthe enemyâs shipping were then in the river near that place; and on\nthe same principle indiscriminate plunder might have taken place on\nboth sides of the river as high up as the manor of Livingston. Little\ngood can be expected of an army whose interest it is to suffer a\ncountry to be abandoned to the enemy, thereby to justify plundering the\ninhabitants. Perhaps, and I donât know that it would be uncharitable to\nsuppose, that it is this trade that makes some people so very fond of\nlittle expeditions.\n\nI have long thought to ascertain these facts, and seek redress not only\nfor the parties immediately injured, but the public; but my time has\nbeen so fully employed of late about other matters that I have been\nobliged to neglect it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMay I expect a line from you whenever you have leisure; be assured\nit will always be most kindly received, though perhaps not quite so\npunctually answered by\n\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             Geo. Clinton.\n\nMy respects to Capt. Gibbs and young Livingston.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WILLIAM DUER, M. C.\n\n\n                                           Head-Quarters, 1778.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI take the liberty to trouble you with a few hints on a matter of\nsome importance. Baron Steuben, who will be the bearer of this, waits\non Congress to have his office[2] arranged upon some decisive and\npermanent footing. It will not be amiss to be on your guard. The Baron\nis a gentleman for whom I have a particular esteem; and whose zeal,\nintelligence, and success, the consequence of both, entitle him to the\ngreatest credit. But I am apprehensive, with all his good qualities, a\nfondness for power and importance, natural to every man, may lead him\nto wish for more extensive prerogatives in his department than it will\nbe for the good of the service to grant. I should be sorry to excite\nany prejudice against him on this account: perhaps I may be mistaken\nin my conjecture. The caution I give will do no harm if I am: if I\nam not, it maybe useful. In either case, the Baron deserves to be\nconsidered as a valuable man, and treated with all the deference which\ngood policy will warrant.\n\nOn the first institution of this office, the General allowed him to\nexercise more ample powers than would be proper for a continuance. They\nwere necessary in the commencement, to put things in a train with a\ndegree of dispatch which the exigency of our affairs required: but it\nhas been necessary to restrain them, even earlier than was intended.\nThe novelty of the office excited questions about its boundaries; the\nextent of its operations alarmed the officers of every rank for their\nown rights. Their jealousies and discontents were rising fast to a\nheight that threatened to overturn the whole plan. It became necessary\nto apply a remedy. The General has delineated the functions of the\nInspectorship in general orders, a copy of which will be sent to\nCongress. The plan is good, and satisfactory to the army in general.\n\nIt may be improved, but it will be unsafe to deviate essentially from\nit. It is of course the Generalâs intention, that whatever regulations\nare adopted by him, should undergo the revision, and receive the\nsanction, of Congress: but it is indispensable, in the present state\nof our army, that he should have the power, from time to time, to\nintroduce and authorize the reformations necessary in our system. It is\na work which must be done by occasional and gradual steps; and ought\nto be intrusted to a person on the spot, who is thoroughly acquainted\nwith all our defects, and has judgment sufficient to adopt the\nprogressive remedies they require. The plan established by Congress, on\na report of the Board of War when Conway was appointed, appears to me\nexceptionable in many respects. It makes the Inspector independent of\nthe Commander-in-chief; confers powers which would produce universal\nopposition in the army; and, by making the previous concurrence of\nthe Board of War requisite to the introduction of every regulation\nwhich should be found necessary, opens such a continual source of\ndelay as would defeat the usefulness of the institution. Let the\nCommander-in-chief introduce, and the legislature afterwards ratify,\nor reject, as they shall think proper. Perhaps you will not differ much\nfrom me, when I suppose, that so far as relates to the Board of War,\nthe former scheme was a _brat of faction_, and therefore ought to be\nrenounced.\n\nThere is one thing which the Baron has much at heart, which, in good\npolicy, he can by no means be indulged in: it is the power of enforcing\nthat part of discipline which we understand by subordination, or an\nobedience to orders. This power can only be properly lodged with the\nCommander-in-chief, and would inflame the whole army if put into other\nhands. Each Captain is vested with it in his company; each Colonel\nin his regiment: each General in his particular command: and the\nCommander-in-chief in the whole.\n\nWhen I began this letter, I did not intend to meddle with any other\nsubject than the Inspectorship; but one just comes into my head which\nappears to me of no small importance. The goodness, or force, of an\narmy, depends as much, perhaps more, on the composition of the corps\nwhich form it, as on its collective number. The composition is good or\nbad, not only according to the quality of the men, but in proportion to\nthe completeness or incompleteness of a corps in respect to numbers. A\nregiment, for instance, with a full complement of officers, and fifty\nor sixty men, is not half so good as a company with the same number of\nmen. A Colonel will look upon such a command as unworthy his ambition,\nand will neglect and despise it: a Captain would pride himself in it,\nand take all the pains in his power to bring it to perfection. In one\ncase we shall see a total relaxation of discipline, and negligence\nof every thing that constitutes military excellence: in the other,\nthere will be attention, energy, and every thing that can be wished.\nOpinion, whether well or ill-founded, is the governing principle of\nhuman affairs. A corps much below its establishment, comparing what it\nis with what it ought to be, loses all confidence in itself; and the\nwhole army loses that confidence and emulation which are essential to\nsuccess. These, and a thousand other things that will occur to you,\nmake it evident, that the most important advantages attend the having\ncomplete corps, and proportional disadvantages the reverse. Ten\nthousand men, distributed into twenty imperfect regiments, will not\nhave the efficiency of the same number in half the number of regiments.\nThe fact is, with respect to the American army, that the want of\ndiscipline, and other defects we labor under, are as much owing to the\nskeleton state of our regiments as to any other cause. What then?\n\nHave we any prospect of filling our regiments? My opinion is, that we\nhave nearly arrived to our _ne plus ultra_. If so, we ought to reduce\nthe number of corps, and give them that substance and consistency\nwhich they want, by incorporating them together, so as to bring them\nnear their establishment. By this measure the army would be infinitely\nimproved; and the State would be saved the expense of maintaining a\nnumber of superfluous officers.\n\nIn the present condition of our regiments, they are incapable even of\nperforming their common exercises without joining two or more together:\nan expedient reluctantly submitted to by those officers who see\nthemselves made second in command of a battalion, instead of first, as\ntheir commission imports; which happens to every younger Colonel whose\nregiment is united with that of an elder.\n\nWhat would be the inconveniencies, while the officers who remain in\ncommand, and who might be selected from the others on account of\nsuperior merit, would applaud themselves in the preference given them,\nand rejoice at a change which confers such additional consequence on\nthemselves?\n\nThose who should be excluded by the measure, would return home\ndiscontented, and make a noise, which would soon subside and be\nforgotten among matters of greater moment. To quiet them still more\neffectually, if it should be thought necessary, they might be put upon\nhalf-pay for a certain time.\n\nIf, on considering this matter, you should agree with me in sentiment,\nit were to be wished the scheme could be immediately adopted, while the\narrangement now in hand is still unexecuted. If it is made, it will be\nrather inconvenient, immediately after, to unhinge and throw the whole\nsystem again afloat. When you determined on your last arrangement,\nyou did not know what success the different States might have had in\ndraughting and recruiting. It would then have been improper to reduce\nthe number of corps, as proposed. We have now seen their success: we\nhave no prospect of seeing the regiments filled; we should reduce them.\n\n                                        Believe me to be,\n                                        With great esteem and regard,\n                                        Dear Sir, your obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\n\n[2] Inspector-General of the Army.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GEN. SULLIVAN.\n\n\n                                           Head-Quarters, 1778.\n\nSir:\n\nHis Excellency has received your two last favors to-day. In the first\nyou hint the want of a reinforcement, but as the intention of your body\nis chiefly for observation and skirmishing, and not to make any serious\nstands, it is the less necessary it should be powerful in numbers. It\nwill, however, depend upon circumstances how far it will be expedient\nto reinforce you; and as soon as any thing can be determined from them,\nyou shall have whatever addition of strength you may stand in need of.\n\nThe information contained in your last, of the enemyâs being encamped\non the road leading from New Brunswick to Princeton, about the Third\nMile Run, is not well founded. We have had parties and officers\nreconnoitring as far as the Mile Run, and there is no sign of an\nencampment. They seem to be taking their old position with their right\nat Amboy, their left at Brunswick; but how long they will remain\nso it is hard to tell. His Excellency desires you will engage some\ntrusty person at South Amboy, on whom you can depend for faithful and\nearly intelligence of the appearance of shipping in the river, or any\npreparations for a movement by water, that we may be in time prepared\nto counteract them.\n\n                                             I am, with regard, Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nJAY TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                         Albany, 8th May, 1778.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAn opinion of your benevolence leads me to address this letter to\nyou. Accident has introduced me to Monsieur Lewis de Caleron. We\nhappen to lodge in the same house. His modesty and decent manners made\nan impression upon me, and induced me to make some inquiries into\nhis history and character. The gentlemen of this place say handsome\nthings of him. He is the son of a Major General who fell last war\nat Ticonderoga. The family is still in Canada, and one of the most\nrespectable in that country. He was sent to France when five years old,\nand there educated. He came out with some French troops to Martinico,\nand by their General, as well as Mr. Bingham, was recommended to\nCongress. They gave him a brevet for a Captainâs commission. He served\nlast campaign as a volunteer, first with General Furmoy, and afterwards\nwith Colonel Morgan. To me he appears to have been neglected. It seems\nhe did not descend to the adulation lately fashionable, and perhaps\nacceptable, in his department. While effrontery and arrogance, even\nin our virtuous and enlightened days, are giving rank and importance\nto men whom wisdom would have left in obscurity, I am persuaded you\nwill be happy in an opportunity of exploring, as well as cherishing,\nmodest merit. I think M. De Caleron is not without it, and under this\nimpression I recommend him to your notice as a probationer.\n\nTell me in some future letter whether he deserves the favorable opinion\nI am inclined to entertain of him.\n\n                                   I am, dear Sir,\n                                   Very sincerely, and with much esteem,\n                                   Your obedient servant,\n                                   John Jay.\n\nLt. Col. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                 Head-Quarters, 4th June, 1778.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Loring having been sent by Sir Henry Clinton to meet Mr. Boudinot,\nor any other person appointed by me for the purpose of effecting an\nexchange of prisoners. I have therefore to desire you (Mr. Boudinot\nbeing absent from camp) to hear any proposals Mr. Loring may have to\noffer on this subject; and to do definitively whatever may be necessary\ntowards the execution of a general exchange of prisoners. And I hereby\nassure you that your proceedings in this instance will be ratified by\nme.\n\n                                    I am, Sir, your very humble servant,\n                                    G. Washington.\n\nLieut. Col. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE.\n\n\n                                                        25th June, 1778.\n\nSir:\n\nWe find, on our arrival here, that the intelligence received on the\nroad is true. The enemy have all filed off from Allen Town, on the\nMonmouth road. Their rear is said to be a mile westward of Lawrence\nTaylorâs tavern, six miles from Allen Town. General Maxwell is at\nHydeâs Town, about three miles from this place. General Dickinson is\nsaid to be on the enemyâs right flank; but where, cannot be told. We\ncan hear nothing certain of General Scott; but, from circumstances,\nhe is probably at Allen Town. We shall, agreeably to your request,\nconsider and appoint some proper place of rendezvous for the union of\nour force, which we shall communicate to Generals Maxwell and Scott,\nand to yourself. In the mean time, I would recommend to you to move\ntoward this place as soon as the convenience of your men will permit.\nI am told that Colonel Morgan is on the enemyâs right flank. We had a\nslight skirmish with their rear this forenoon, at Robert Montgomeryâs,\non the Monmouth road, leading from Allen Town. We shall see General\nMaxwell immediately, and you will hear from us again. Send this to the\nGeneral after reading it.\n\n                                                I am your obât servât,\n                                                Alex. Hamilton.\n\n                Doctor Stileâs House, Cranbury Town, 9 oâclock.\n\nWe are just informed that General Scott passed by Hooperâs tavern, five\nmiles from Allen Town, this afternoon at five oâclock.\n\nM. De Lafayette.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                      {Robinâs Tavern, 8 miles from Allen Town,\n                      {12 oâclock, June 26, 1778.\n\nSir:\n\nWe have halted the troops at this place. The enemy, by our last\nreports, were four miles from this (that is, their rear), and had\npassed the road which turns off toward South Amboy, which determines\ntheir route toward Shrewsbury. Our reason for halting, is the extreme\ndistress of the troops for want of provisions. General Wayneâs\ndetachment is almost starving, and seems both unwilling and unable to\nmarch further till they are supplied. If we do not receive an immediate\nsupply, the whole purpose of our detachment must be frustrated.\n\nThis morning we missed doing any thing, from a deficiency of\nintelligence. On my arrival at Cranbury yester-evening, I proceeded,\nby desire of the Marquis, immediately to Hydeâs Town and Allen Town,\nto take measures for co-operating with the different parts of the\ndetachment, and to find what was doing to procure intelligence. I found\nevery precaution was neglected; no horse was near the enemy, nor could\nbe heard of till late in the morning: so that before we could send out\nparties and get the necessary information, they were in full march: and\nas they have marched pretty expeditiously, we should not be able to\ncome up with them during the march of the day, if we did not suffer the\nimpediment we do, on the score of provisions. We are entirely at a loss\nwhere the army is, which is no inconsiderable check to our enterprise.\nIf the army is wholly out of supporting distance, we risk the total\nloss of the detachment in making an attack.\n\nIf the army will countenance us, we may do something clever. We feel\nour personal honor, as well as the honor of the army, and the good of\nthe service, interested; and are heartily desirous to attempt whatever\nthe disposition of our men will second, and prudence authorize. It is\nevident the enemy wish to avoid, not to engage us.\n\nDesertions, I imagine, have been pretty considerable to-day. I have\nseen eight or ten deserters, and have heard of many more. We have\nhad some little skirmishing by detached parties: one attacked their\nrear-guard with a degree of success, killed a few, and took seven\nprisoners.\n\nAn officer is just come in, who informs that he left the enemyâs rear\nfive miles off, still in march, about half an hour ago. To ascertain\nstill more fully their route, I have ordered a fresh party on their\nleft, toward the head of their column. They have three brigades in rear\nof their baggage.\n\n                               I am, with great respect and regard, Sir,\n                               Your obedient servant,\n                               A. Hamilton.\n\nHis Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                                          June 28, 1778.\n\nSir:\n\nThe result of what I have seen and heard, concerning the enemy, is,\nthat they have encamped with their van a little beyond Monmouth\nCourt House, and their rear at Manalapanâs river, about seven\nmiles from this place. Their march to-day has been very judiciously\nconducted;--their baggage in front, and their flying army in the rear,\nwith a rear-guard of one thousand men about four hundred paces from the\nmain body. To attack them in this situation, without being supported by\nthe whole army, would be folly in the extreme. If it should be thought\nadvisable to give the necessary support, the army can move to some\nposition near the enemyâs left flank, which would put them in a very\nawkward situation, with so respectable a body in their rear; and it\nwould put it out of their power to turn either flank, should they be\nso disposed. Their left is strongly posted, and I am told their right\nalso. By some accounts, one part of their army lies on the road leading\nfrom the Monmouth road to South Amboy. It is not improbable that South\nAmboy may be the object.\n\nI had written thus far when your letter to the Marquis arrived. This\nputs the matter on a totally different footing. The detachment will\nmarch to-morrow morning at three oâclock to English Town.\n\n                                     I am, with great regard and esteem,\n                                     Your obedient servant,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\nHis Excellency Gen. Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                    Black Point, July 20, 1778.\n\nSir:\n\nInclosed I transmit your Excellency a letter from Count DâEstaing. He\nhas had the river sounded, and finds he cannot enter. He will sail\nfor Rhode Island to-morrow evening. In the mean time, he is making\ndemonstrations to deceive the enemy, and beget an opinion that he\nintends to operate in this quarter. He would sail immediately, but he\nawaits the arrival, or to hear, of a frigate which carried Mr. Gerard\nto Delaware, and which he appointed to meet him at Sandy Hook; so\nthat he fears his sudden and unexpected departure, before she arrives,\nmight cause her to be lost. He will not, however, wait longer than till\nto-morrow evening. We have agreed, that five cannon, fired briskly,\nshall be a signal of his arrival by day, and the same number, with\nfive sky-rockets, a signal by night. In communicating this to General\nSullivan, the Count wishes not a moment may be lost; and that he may\nbe directed to have persons stationed on the coast, and intermediate\nexpresses, to facilitate the communication between them. Pilots will\nbe a material article. He begs every thing may be forwarded as much as\npossible; and as many troops collected as may be. He would be glad if a\ndetachment could march from your army, or could be sent by water; for\nwhich purpose he would send covering ships, and some vessels he has\ntaken, by way of transports; but he cannot think of losing so much time\nas seems necessary. If the water scheme could shorten it, it would be\na happy circumstance. He recommends it to your attention; and that you\nwould take measures, if the end can be better answered in this way, and\nmeet him with information of the part he may have to act to execute the\nplan. I perceive he can, with difficulty, debark four thousand troops;\nbut he will try to do it.\n\nI hope your Excellency will excuse my not being myself the bearer of\nthese particulars; the end may be answered by letter. Mr. Neville is\nanxious to get on. I just have heard of dispatches arrived from you. I\ndonât know but they may contain something new which may make the Count\nto wish a good conveyance to return an answer. My stay till to-morrow\nmorning may answer that end. I shall not delay coming forward.\n\n                                         I am, Sir, your most respectful\n                                         And obedient servant,\n                                         Alex. Hamilton.\n\nHis Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                            Newark, July 23, 1778, one oâclock.\n\nSir:\n\nI wrote to your Excellency the evening of the 20th, by Major Neville.\nI remained in the neighborhood of Black Point till the afternoon\nfollowing. The Count had received his expected dispatches from\nCongress, and was to sail, as I mentioned before, the first fair wind.\nAt Brunswick, yesterday, Mr. Caldwell joined me. He was immediately\nfrom the Point, and brought intelligence that the fleet got under way\nyesterday morning. The wind, unfortunately, has been much against them;\nwhich is so much the more to be regretted, as they are rather in want\nof water.\n\nI need not suggest to your Excellency, that an essential part of the\nRhode Island plan, is to take every possible measure to watch the\nenemyâs motions, and to establish expresses from place to place, to\ngive the Count instant information of any movement among their fleet.\nThis will enable him to be in time to intercept them, should they\nattempt to evacuate New-York, while he is at Rhode Island; and will, in\ngeneral, facilitate the intercourse and co-operation between him and\nyour Excellency.\n\nI have nothing new to communicate, beside what was sent by Major\nNeville, and what I now send. All the ideas interchanged between\nthe Count and myself, were such as were familiar before I left Head\nQuarters. He was to go to Rhode Island, and, in conjunction with\nGeneral Sullivan, endeavor to possess himself of the enemyâs ships and\ntroops there; if, on his arrival, he had good reason to think it could\nbe effected without further assistance. If not, he will be glad of a\nreinforcement from you in the most expeditious manner possible. What\nmanner you think will be most expeditious, you will adopt; and if his\naid may be useful, he will afford it as soon as he is informed of it.\n\nThis being the case, my immediate presence at Head Quarters is the less\nnecessary as to this business; and I hope your Excellency will indulge\nme, if I do not make all the dispatch back which a case of emergency\nwould require; though I do not mean to delay, more than a moderate\nattention to my frail constitution may make not improper. I have, &c.,\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\nHis Excellency Gen. Washington.\n\n\n\n\nCOL. LAURENS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nYou have seen, and by this time considered, General Leeâs infamous\npublication. I have collected some hints for an answer; but I do not\nthink, either that I can rely upon my own knowledge of facts and\nstyle to answer him fully, or that it would be prudent to undertake\nit without counsel. An affair of this kind ought to be passed over in\ntotal silence, or answered in a masterly manner.\n\nThe ancient secretary is the Recueil of modern history and anecdotes,\nand will give them to us with candor, elegance, and perspicuity.\nThe pen of Junius is in your hand; and I think you will, without\ndifficulty, expose, in his defence, letters, and last production, such\na tissue of falsehood and inconsistency, as will satisfy the world, and\nput him for ever to silence.\n\nI think the affair will be definitively decided in Congress this day.\nHe has found means to league himself with the _old faction_, and to\ngain a great many partisans.\n\nAdieu, my dear boy. I shall set out for camp to-morrow.\n\n                                                  John Laurens.\n\n\n\n\nLAFAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               A Yorctown, 1er Septembre, 1778.\n\nNe suis-je pas bien malheureux, cher Colonel. On me pousse pour aller Ã \nBoston, on me chasse de Rhode Island, ils nâont ni repos, ni patience\nque je ne sois parti, et le mÃªme jour que je mâabsente est le seul oÃ¹\njâaurais dÃ», oÃ¹ jâavais voulu Ãªtre dans lâÃ®le. Le diable en veut dans\nce moment Ã  tous les franÃ§ais; heureusement que je viens de lâattraper,\ncar Ã  force de courir je suis arrivÃ© Ã  temps pour lâÃ©vacuation dont\nil voulait encore me priver. Le malheur de ne pas Ãªtre Ã  la premiÃ¨re\naffaire mâa fait la peine la plus vive, et je ne mâen consolerai\njamais, quoique ce soit bien loin dâÃªtre ma faute. Les deux retraites\nfont honneur aux troupes et au gÃ©nÃ©ral Sullivan, qui sây est conduit\nparfaitement, elles en font rue aux Anglais et Ã  leur gÃ©nÃ©raux qui\nnâont montrÃ© ni activitÃ©, ni gÃ©nie, du moins Ã  ce quâil me paraÃ®t.\n\nLe malheureux Mr. Tousard a eu le bras emportÃ© au milieu dâune des\nactions les plus valeureuses qui ait Ã©tÃ© faite. Câest un homme aussi\nbrave quâil est honnÃªte. Je crains dâembarrasser le gÃ©nÃ©ral en lui\nmandant ce que je voudrais quâon fÃ®t pour lui; mais la commission de\nMajor ne pouvait-elle pas se changer en celle de lieutenant Colonel;\nil avait fait un arrangement avant de partir _le grand arrangement de\nMr. du Coudray_, oÃ¹ en cas de la perte dâun membre, ils devaient avoir\nune pension de tant, cet arrangement-lÃ  qui comme vous savez nâa pas Ã©tÃ©\nacceptÃ©, ne pouvait-il pas se renouveler en sa faveur.\n\nIl faut que vous me rendiez un grand service; câest de me mander le\nplus de dÃ©tails possibles sur la flotte de Lord Howe,--les moyens qui\nexistent Ã  New-York, etc. etc. Mr. DâEstaing a beaucoup de raisons de\ncroire quâil est arrivÃ© quelques vaisseaux dâAngleterre, autres le\nCornwall. Mandez-moi dans une longue lettre, Mon Cher Hamilton, ce\nque vous pensez sur ce qui a Ã©tÃ© fait, ce qui va se faire, et ce qui\npouvait Ãªtre fait dans la suite. Votre dÃ©pÃªche me trouvera Ã  Warren,\npetite ville prÃ¨s de la Providence, oÃ¹ je vais mâoccuper Ã  garder\nbeaucoup de pays avec peu de troupes, et oÃ¹ sans rÃ©pondre dâempÃªcher\nune descente des ennemis, je ferai le moins mal possible; si forces\nÃ©gales, je tÃ¢cherai de les battre. On me flatte que le GÃ©nÃ©ral viendra\nici lui-mÃªme; Dieu le veuille. Les affaires sur lesquelles je vous ai\nÃ©crit mes complaintes, lâappaisent un peu, mais pour prendre Rhode\nIsland il nous faut le GÃ©nÃ©ral Washington.\n\nJâattends de vos nouvelles par Mons de Pontgibault et finirai\nsimplement ma lettre en vous assurant de mon tendre attachement.\n\n                                                     Lafayette.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ----.\n\n\n                                   Head Quarters, Nov. 8, 1778.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your favor of the 4th, and shall with pleasure\ncommunicate the intelligence we have had at Head Quarters. On the\nmorning of the third one hundred and eight sail of vessels sailed out\nof the Hook,--supposed, from the best calculations, to contain seven or\neight thousand men. They first steered to the eastward, but soon after\nchanged their course and bore S. E. with the wind at N. W. The general\naccounts from New-York speak of three distinct embarkations--one for\nthe West Indies--another for Halifax--another for St. Augustine. One\ndivision, which seems to be best ascertained, contains ten or twelve\nBritish regiments, and most of the new levies, which probably went in\nthe above-mentioned fleet.\n\nThis much is pretty certain, that the embarkation has continued since\nthe departure of that fleet, which is a strong circumstance in favor\nof a general evacuation. All their vessels the least out of repair\nare drawn up to the different ship-yards, and their repairs are going\non with all possible vigor. Whether the merchants are packing up or\nnot, is a point still much _in dubio_; though we have several accounts\nthat look like it, but they are not so precise and certain as could\nbe wished. Several bales of goods have been seen on the wharves,\nmarked for particular ships. A deserter, indeed, lately from the city,\ninsists that he saw Coffin and Anderson packing up. This, if true,\nwould be decisive, for this is a very considerable house particularly\nattached to the army. One of our spies, a trusty one too, writes the\n31st of October that the principal part of the sick from the hospitals\nhad embarked; but this stands almost wholly upon its own bottom. The\ncapture of Jamaica seems to be a mere rumor. There are several others,\nrespecting St. Kitts, Monserat, and Grenada. The two former are\nsaid to have been taken by surprise on a temporary absence of their\nguard-ships, but these stories were not improbably suggested by a late\nsudden and very considerable rise in the prices of rum and molasses.\nThe former being as high as fourteen or fifteen shillings per gallon.\nLarge purchases have been made of these articles as sea stores for the\ntroops, and the speculators in the city have been bidding against the\nCommissaries, which better accounts for the increased prices.\n\nIt is a question very undecided in my mind whether the enemy\nwill evacuate or not. Reasoning _a priori_, the arguments seem\nto be strongest for it--from the exhausted state of the British\nresources--the naked condition of their dominions every where--and the\npossibility of a Spanish war. But on the other hand naval superiority\nmust do a great deal in the business. This, I think, considering all\nthings, appears clearly enough to be on the side of Britain. The\nsluggishness of Spain affords room to doubt her taking a decisive\npart. The preserving posts in these States will greatly distress our\ntrade, and give security to the British West India trade. They will\nalso cover the West Indies, and restrain any operations of ours against\nthe British dominions on the continent. These considerations, and\nthe depreciated state of our currency, will be strong inducements to\nkeep New-York and Rhode Island, if not with a view to conquest, with\na view to temporary advantages, and making better terms in a future\nnegotiation.\n\nFrom appearances, the great delay which attends the embarkation, the\nabsolute tranquillity of the post at Rhode Island, where there is no\nkind of preparation for leaving it, and some other circumstances,\nseem to indicate an intention to remain. On the other hand, besides\nthe general appearances I have already mentioned, their inattention\nto the petition of the refugees, and the not raising new works, are\nstrong additional reasons for going away. I think it most probable,\nif they were determined to continue a garrison, that they would give\nmost explicit assurances to their friends, in order to encourage their\nproposal, and engage them to aid in maintaining it. I think also they\nwould contract their works, to be better proportioned to the number of\nthe garrison, and of course more defensible, by throwing a chain of\nfortifications across the narrow part of the island.\n\nNothing has yet been decided, that we know of, with respect to the\nsentences you mention. General Leeâs case, by our last advices, was on\nthe eve of a final decision. It seems he has made a strong party in\nCongress, and is very confident of having the sentence annulled. St.\nClairâs trial was ordered to be printed for the separate consideration\nof the members.\n\nThe depreciation of our currency really casts a gloom on our prospects,\nbut my sentiments on this subject are rather peculiar. I think, bad\nas it is, it will continue to draw out the resources of the country a\ngood while longer, and especially if the enemy make such detachments,\nof which there is hardly a doubt, as will oblige them to act on the\ndefensive. This will make our public expenditures infinitely less--and\nwill allow the States leisure to attend to the arrangements of their\nfinances, as well as the country tranquillity to cultivate its\nresources.\n\nAny letters that may come to Head Quarters for you will be carefully\nforwarded.\n\n                              I am, with the most respectful attachment,\n                              Dear Sir, your obedât servant,\n                              A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\n\n\n                                Head Quarters, 19th Dec., 1778.\n\nI snatch a hasty moment, my dear Baron, to acknowledge the receipt of\nyour obliging favor of the sixth. It came here while I was absent in an\ninterview with some British Commissioners on the subject of an exchange\nof prisoners, and was not delivered to me till two days ago. I am sorry\nthat your business does not seem to make so speedy a progress as we\nall wish; but I hope it will soon come to a satisfactory termination.\nI wish you to be in a situation to employ yourself usefully and\nagreeably, and to contribute to giving our military constitution that\norder and perfection it certainly wants. I have not time now to enter\nupon some matters which I shall take another opportunity to give you my\nsentiments concerning. I have read your letter to Lee with pleasure.\nIt was conceived in terms which the offence merited; and if he had had\nany feeling, must have been felt by him. Considering the pointedness\nand severity of your expressions, his answer was certainly a very\nmodest one, and proved that he had not a violent appetite for so close\na _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_ as you seem disposed to insist upon. This evasion, if\nknown to the world, would do him very little honor. I donât know but\nI shall be shortly at Philadelphia: if so, I shall have the honor of\npersonally assuring you of the perfect respect and esteem with which I\nam,\n\n                                               My dear Baron,\n                                               Your most obedât servant,\n                                               Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATIVE OF AN AFFAIR OF HONOR BETWEEN GENERAL LEE AND COL. LAURENS.\n\n\n                                                    24th December, 1778.\n\nGeneral Lee, attended by Major Edwards and Col. Laurens attended by\nCol. Hamilton, met agreeable to appointment on Wednesday afternoon\nhalf past three, in a wood, situate near the four mile stone on the\nPoint-no-Point Road. Pistols having been the weapons previously fixed\nupon, and the combatants being provided with a brace each, it was asked\nin what manner they were to proceed. General Lee proposed to advance\nupon one another, and each fire at what time and distance he thought\nproper. Col. Laurens expressed his preference of this mode, and agreed\nto the proposal accordingly.\n\nThey approached each other within about five or six paces, and\nexchanged a shot almost at the same moment. As Col. Laurens was\npreparing for a second discharge, General Lee declared himself wounded.\nCol. Laurens, as if apprehending the wound to be more serious than it\nproved, advanced towards the General to offer his support. The same was\ndone by Col. Hamilton and Major Edwards under a similar apprehension.\nGeneral Lee then said the wound was inconsiderable; less than he had\nimagined at the first stroke of the ball, and proposed to fire a\nsecond time. This was warmly opposed both by Col. Hamilton and Major\nEdwards, who declared it to be their opinion, that the affair should\nterminate as it then stood. But General Lee repeated his desire,\nthat there should be a second discharge, and Col. Laurens agreed to\nthe proposal. Col. Hamilton observed that, unless the General was\ninfluenced by motives of personal enmity, he did not think the affair\nought to be pursued any further; but as Gen. Lee seemed to persist in\ndesiring it, he was too tender of his friendâs honor to persist in\nopposing it. The combat was then going to be renewed; but Major Edwards\nagain declaring his opinion, that the affair ought to end where it was,\nGen. Lee then expressed his confidence in the honor of the gentlemen\nconcerned as seconds, and said he should be willing to comply with\nwhatever they should coolly and deliberately determine. Col. Laurens\nconsented to the same.\n\nCol. Hamilton and Major Edwards withdrew, and conversing awhile on the\nsubject, still concurred fully in the opinion, that for the most urgent\nreasons, the affair should terminate as it was then circumstanced. This\ndecision was communicated to the parties and agreed to by them, upon\nwhich they immediately returned to town; General Lee slightly wounded\nin the right side.\n\nDuring the interview a conversation to the following purport passed\nbetween General Lee and Col. Laurens. On Col. Hamiltonâs intimating\nthe idea of personal enmity, as before mentioned--Gen. Lee declared he\nhad none, and had only met Col. Laurens, to defend his own honor--that\nMr. Laurens best knew whether there was any on his part. Col. Laurens\nreplied, that General Lee was acquainted with the motives that had\nbrought him there, which were, that he had been informed from what he\nthought good authority, that Gen. Lee had spoken of General Washington\nin the grossest and most opprobrious terms of personal abuse, which he,\nCol. Laurens, thought himself bound to resent, as well on account of\nthe relation he bore to General Washington, as from motives of personal\nfriendship and respect for his character. General Lee acknowledged\nthat he had given his opinion against General Washingtonâs military\ncharacter to his particular friends, and might perhaps do it again. He\nsaid every man had a right to give his sentiments freely of military\ncharacters, and that he did not think himself personally accountable\nto Col. Laurens for what he had done in that respect. But he said he\nnever had spoken of General Washington in the terms mentioned, which\nhe could not have done; as well because he had always esteemed General\nWashington as a man, as because such abuse would be incompatible with\nthe character he would ever wish to sustain as a gentleman.\n\nUpon the whole, we think it a piece of justice to the two gentlemen to\ndeclare, that after they met, their conduct was strongly marked with\nall the politeness, generosity, coolness and firmness, that ought to\ncharacterize a transaction of this nature.\n\n                                            Alexander Hamilton.\n                                            Ev.

De la Colombe, qui dans deux\nmois part pour France. Je vous promets beaucoup de vÃ©ritÃ© et jeu\ndâesprit dans la narration.\n\nDans peu de minutes, nous voguerons; prÃ©sentez mon respect Ã  son\nExcellence, et mes amitiÃ©s Ã  toute votre famille. Souvenez-vous de tout\nce que je vous ai dit Ã  mon dÃ©part et soyez homme de parole.\n\nAdieu, soyez sÃ»r que vous avez en moi un bon et vrai ami; nâen doutez\npoint, et vous rendrez justice.\n\n                                        Le Chevalier Duplessis.\n\n  Col. Hamilton,\n  Aid-de-Camp of\n  His Excellency General Washington,\n                      Head Quarters.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n\n                                 Head Quarters, March 14, 1779.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nColonel Laurens, who will have the honor of delivering you this letter,\nis on his way to South Carolina, on a project which I think, in the\npresent situation of affairs there, is a very good one, and deserves\nevery kind of support and encouragement. This is, to raise two, three,\nor four battalions of negroes, with the assistance of the government\nof that State, by contributions from the owners, in proportion to the\nnumber they possess. If you should think proper to enter upon the\nsubject with him, he will give you a detail of his plan. He wishes to\nhave it recommended by Congress to the State; and, as an inducement,\nthat they would engage to take their battalions into Continental pay.\n\nIt appears to me, that an expedient of this kind, in the present\nstate of Southern affairs, is the most rational that can be adopted,\nand promises very important advantages. Indeed, I hardly see how a\nsufficient force can be collected in that quarter without it: and\nthe enemyâs operations there are growing infinitely serious and\nformidable. I have not the least doubt, that the negroes will make\nvery excellent soldiers, with proper management: and I will venture\nto pronounce, that they cannot be put in better hands than those of\nMr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, enterprise, and every\nother qualification, requisite to succeed in such an undertaking.\nIt is a maxim with some great military judges, that, with sensible\nofficers, soldiers can hardly be too stupid: and, on this principle,\nit is thought that the Russians would make the best soldiers in the\nworld, if they were under other officers than their own. The King of\nPrussia is among the number who maintains this doctrine, and has a very\nemphatic saying on the occasion, which I do not exactly recollect. I\nmention this because I have frequently heard it objected to the scheme\nof embodying negroes, that they are too stupid to make soldiers. This\nis so far from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think their\nwant of cultivation (for their natural faculties are as good as ours),\njoined to that habit of subordination which they acquire from a life of\nservitude, will enable them sooner to become soldiers than our white\ninhabitants. Let officers be men of sense and sentiment; and the nearer\nthe soldiers approach to machines, perhaps the better.\n\nI foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from\nprejudice and self-interest. The contempt we have been taught to\nentertain for the blacks, makes us fancy many things that are founded\nneither in reason nor experience; and an unwillingness to part with\nproperty of so valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to\nshow the impracticability, or pernicious tendency, of a scheme which\nrequires such sacrifices. But it should be considered, that if we do\nnot make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will; and that\nthe best way to counteract the temptations they will hold out, will\nbe, to offer them ourselves. An essential part of the plan is, to give\nthem their freedom with their swords. This will secure their fidelity,\nanimate their courage, and, I believe, will have a good influence\nupon those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation. This\ncircumstance, I confess, has no small weight in inducing me to wish the\nsuccess of the project; for the dictates of humanity, and true policy,\nequally interest me in favor of this unfortunate class of men.\n\nWhile I am on the subject of southern affairs, you will excuse the\nliberty I take in saying, that I do not think measures sufficiently\nvigorous are pursuing for our defence in that quarter. Except the few\nregular troops of South Carolina, we seem to be relying wholly on the\nmilitia of that and the two neighboring States. These will soon grow\nimpatient of service, and leave our affairs in a miserable situation.\nNo considerable force can be uniformly kept up by militia; to say\nnothing of the many obvious and well-known inconveniences that attend\nthis kind of troops. I would beg leave to suggest, Sir, that no time\nought to be lost in making a draught of militia to serve a twelvemonth,\nfrom the States of North and South Carolina and Virginia. But South\nCarolina, being very weak in her population of whites, may be excused\nfrom the draught, on condition of furnishing the black battalions.\nThe two others may furnish about three thousand five hundred men, and\nbe exempted, on that account, from sending any succors to this army.\nThe States to the northward of Virginia, will be fully able to give\ncompetent supplies to the army here; and it will require all the force\nand exertions of the three States I have mentioned, to withstand the\nstorm which has arisen, and is increasing in the South.\n\nThe troops draughted, must be thrown into battalions, and officered in\nthe best possible manner. The supernumerary officers may be made use\nof as far as they will go. If arms are wanted for their troops, and\nno better way of supplying them is to be found, we should endeavor to\nlevy a contribution of arms upon the militia at large. Extraordinary\nexigencies demand extraordinary means. I fear this southern business\nwill become a very _grave_ one.\n\n                                  With the truest respect and esteem,\n                                  I am, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                  Alex. Hamilton.\n\n  His Excellây John Jay,\n  President of Congress.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\n\n\n                                                           May 26, 1779.\n\nThe General, on reflection, is a little uneasy about the route you\nintend to take. He thinks it not quite safe, as the enemy have troops\non Long Island and may easily throw a party across the Sound, so that\nyou would be in danger of having your agreeable dreams interrupted, if\nyou should sleep any where from New Haven to Fairfield.\n\nIt is probable, one of the Countâs motives in coming this way may be\nto see the ruins of those places; and if he could do it without risk,\nit would be desirable; but he would not probably be at his ease, if\nin consequence of it, he should be obliged to attend the levee of Sir\nHenry Clinton. This may happen if he continues his intention, unless\nvery good precautions are taken to avoid the danger. The General\nrecommends it to you, at least to be very vigilant upon your post, and\nnot to suffer yourself to be surprised. You will be so good as to let\nus have timely notice of your approach, as we shall, at least, meet you\nat Fishkill Landing, with boats to take you down to Head Quarters.\n\n                                I have the honor to be,\n                                Your affectionate and respectful friend,\n                                A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO OTHO H. WILLIAMS.\n\n\n                                                        11th June, 1779.\n\nDear Williams:\n\nThe General sends you four fresh horsemen to enable you to transmit\nhim intelligence. The General will take the road you marched to your\nquarters.\n\nMind your eye, my dear boy, and if you have an opportunity, fight hard.\n\n                                                Your friend and servant,\n                                                A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MAJOR LEE, OR IN HIS ABSENCE, CAPT. McLANE.\n\n\n                                                             July, 1779.\n\nSir:\n\nThere is an encampment of the enemy, or a demonstration of one, which\nappears on the other side of the river, considerably on this side of\nTarry Town. You will be pleased in consequence to have patrols kept\nfrom this till morning, seven or eight miles down along the shore and\non the roads leading to this place on our right. This might be a\ncritical night, and demands the greatest vigilance.\n\n                                             I am, Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             A. Hamilton,\n                                             Aid-de-Camp.\n\n\n\n\nHENRY LAURENS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                 Philadelphia, 29th July, 1779.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn addition to the lines which I troubled you with the day before\nyesterday by Colonel, or I should say Doctor McHenry; he is an honest\nman with either, or without any title, permit me to inform you. I\npresented to Congress this morning, Colonel Fleuryâs earnest request\nfor the flag which he had the glory of lowering at Stony Point, but\nthere was not a single voice heard in second to my motion. In truth, I\nhad spoken to several of the members on the subject before the meeting\nof Congress; these discovered not only no inclination, but rather an\naversion to parting with so high a testimony of a great and brilliant\nvictory; nevertheless, I determined to fulfil my promise; you see\nthe success. Fancy often fills up the chasms made by disappointments\nof this kind; many of the most celebrated Italian originals in the\ncabinets of curious fanciful men in England, are good copies. Suppose\nin the present instance the Colonel should order an accurate likeness\nof the first flag to be made, and content himself with that, or that\nby a very trifling practice of ambidexterity, he should exchange\nthe copy for the original; or suppose he should take a much better\nand less exceptionable method for accomplishing his wishes, that he\nshould arm himself with one of Dunlapâs Packets, in which his gallant\nbehavior and the particular feat of cutting the halliards, stand upon\nrecord by authority of Congress; this might be kept in the tin case\nwith commissions and testimonials, answer every purpose of display,\nand save the trouble and expense of lugging sixty or eighty yards of\nbunting round the Globe.\n\nI have executed my commission; have added my best consolatory advice\nto a disappointed client, and trust the Colonel will do me the justice\nto assure himself, my own opinion on the propriety of his suit was not\ndisclosed fully or partially to any body before I had received a modest\ndenial by a profound silence.\n\nNothing new from South Carolina, excepting a delegate, who left\nCharleston one day before the date of our late letters.\n\n                                          I have the honor to be,\n                                          With great esteem and respect,\n                                          Dear Sir,\n                                          Your obât and humble servât,\n                                          Henry Laurens.\n\nCol. A. Hamilton, Head Quarters, North River.\n\n\n\n\nCOLONEL FLEURY TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                           LâInfantery Camp, 18th August, 1779.\n\nDear Colonel:\n\nThe officers of the two A Battalions of lâInfantery, which I actually\ncommand, have applied to me for ceasing to run over those craggy\nmountains barefooted, and beg that I would write to head quarters to\nhave an order from his Excellency to get one pair of shoes for each;\nthe shoes they hint to are at New Windsor, and their intention is to\npay for.\n\nDo not be so greedy for shoes as for my blanket, and think that the\nmost urgent necessity has determined their application; they are quite\nbarefooted.\n\n                                            I am very respectfully, Sir,\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\n                                            L. Fleury.\n\nN. B. As his Excellency could form a very advantageous idea of our\nbeing lucky in shoes by the appearance of the officers who dined\nto-day at head quarters, and were not quite without, I beg you would\nobserve to him, if necessary, that each company had furnished a shoe\nfor their dressing.\n\n                                    Camp lâInfantery, 19th August, 1779.\n\nSi vous savez un mot de M. De La Luzerne dites le moi.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO JAMES DUANE.\n\n\n                                                      August 28th, 1779.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI with pleasure snatch a moment, agreeable to your request, to inform\nyou of the events which have taken place since you left us. A York\npaper of the 24th, announces the arrival of the Russell of 74, which\nparted three days before from Arbuthnotâs fleet, which was of course\nmomently expected. Subsequent intelligence gives us the arrival of the\nwhole fleet. This comes through different channels, and is believed;\nbut we have no particulars. _Wayne is still safe._\n\nNorthern news says that Sir George Collier, having appeared in\nPenobscot River, put our grand fleet to the rout. They were run ashore,\nabandoned, and burnt; the troops and seamen safe. Colonel Jacksonâs\nregiment, which had been sent as a reinforcement, landed at Portsmouth.\nThis account comes in a letter from General Gates to Colonel Hay.\nTo counterbalance the bad in a degree, he tells me three of our\nContinental frigates were arrived at Boston with six sail out of ten of\nthe Jamaica fleet which had fallen into their hands, containing 5000\nhdds. of rum and sugar.\n\n                                     I have the honor to be,\n                                     Very faithfully and affectionately,\n                                     Your most obedient servant,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\nHon. Mr. Duane.\n\n\n\n\nBARON STEUBEN TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                      August 30th, 1779.\n\nMr. De la Luzerne desires me to join him on his route, to accompany him\nto head quarters. I shall depart on Tuesday morning for Providence,\nwhere I may require three days to review the regiments; after which I\nshall return immediately to Hartford to join the Minister.\n\nI promised to give you a picture of his new Excellency. He is about\nthirty-six years of age, though he appears younger. In the last war he\nwas aid-de-camp to Marshal Broglio. He appears to be a man of solid\nsense, and less presumptuous than the people of quality in that country\nusually are. His manners are prepossessing; and they would be more so\nif he could speak English. His character appears to me to be good; and\nhe is less reserved than European Ministers usually are. His personal\nappearance will not displease the ladies of Philadelphia. He is a young\nchevalier of Malta, who is not so much imbrowned by his crusades, but\nthat the American beauties will take pains to teach him English in a\nshort time. His Secretary, Mr. Marbois, is a counsellor of Parliament,\nfrom Metz in Lorraine--speaks good English; and is a man who shows much\ninformation and judgment.\n\n                                                       Steuben.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                     Kingston, 4th Sept., 1779.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have spent some days at this place with our Legislature, and have\nbeen happy in finding their zeal for the common cause undiminished.\nEvery thing which can be asked for the army, they will most cheerfully\ngrant, and Col. Wadsworth is gone away perfectly satisfied. It is\na circumstance to their honor that amidst all their wants and\ndistresses--flour and carriage have been supplied at 25 per cent. less\nthan in any part of the Continent: and that by a law of the State. If\nit had produced the effect to be expected from so spirited an example,\nit must have had a powerful influence on our money: but it is to be\nlamented that we stood _single_, and that our citizens are impoverished\nby a sacrifice of a fourth of their produce and labor to little purpose.\n\nBe kind enough to forward the inclosed to Lt. Col. Washington;\nand to present my respectful compliments to his Excellency the\nCommander-in-Chief and the family; and believe me to be, with real\nesteem and affection,\n\n                                                 Dear Col.,\n                                                 Your most obât servant,\n                                                 James Duane.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\n\n\n                                                            Sept., 1779.\n\nDear Baron:\n\nI am at this moment honored with your letter of the 80th ultimo, and\nhave communicated that part of it which concerns M. De la Luzerne to\nthe General; agreeably to which we shall take our measures on the\nreception of this private public gentleman. We had prepared a party of\nCavalry to receive him at Fishkill, on the supposition that he would\nset out with an escort from Boston; but we have now sent orders to the\nparty immediately to take the route you mention to Hartford, and there\nplace themselves under your orders.\n\nThe General requests you will make his respectful compliments to your\nChevalier, and gives you carte blanche to say every handsome thing you\nthink proper in his name, of the pleasure which this visit will give\nhim. I have no doubt that your portrait, which appears to be executed\nen maitre, will be found a just representation of the original; and if\nhe is as happy as his predecessor in gaining the esteem and confidence\nof the _men_ of this country, with so many talents to conciliate the\nleaders, his ministry will not be unsuccessful. I augur well for him.\nGen. Washington proposes to meet him as a private gentleman at Fishkill.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\n\n\n                                                          Sept. 7, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI this day received your letter of the 4th, with one inclosed for Col.\nWashington, which was immediately forwarded. You do not mention the\nreceipt of a line from me which I wrote several days since, giving you\nan account of Arbuthnotâs arrival.\n\nThe current of our intelligence makes the reinforcement with him amount\nto about three thousand, mostly recruits and in bad health; it is said\nsome preparations are making for an expedition, and there are various\nconjectures about the object; some point to the Southward; perhaps\nthe true destination is the West Indies. But, I confess, I should not\nbe surprised, if the enemy should make a further and vigorous attempt\nto gain possession of two or three of the Southern States. If their\naffairs are so desperate with respect to alliance as we are told, the\nobject of the war on their side, from conquest must necessarily change\nto pacification. The acquisition of two or three of the Southern States\nwould be a handsome counterpoise to their losses in the Islands, and\nwould enable them to negotiate with the more credit and success the\nensuing winter.\n\nI am happy to have it in my power to gratify your curiosity about the\nWestern expedition with the inclosed agreeable account. It is the\nsubstance of a letter from General Sullivan of the 30th, extracted\nat Col. Hayâs request, for Mr. Lowdonâs paper. The facts are all\ntrue, though you will perceive I have given it a few of the usual\nembellishments of a newspaper paragraph. I have not specified the\nnumber of Gen Sullivanâs wounded; they amount to thirty-nine, among\nwhich are Major Titcomb and two other officers. This is a pleasing and\nI hope decisive event.\n\nIn haste, but with the greatest esteem and regard,\n\n                                        I have the honor to be your most\n                                        Obedât servant,\n                                        Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nCOL. LEE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                         Sept. 10, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI wish you would send me a copy of General Washingtonâs letter of\ninstructions to me--a copy of General Orders on the subject of the\n19th and the sentence of the Court and trial. The emissaries from the\nVirginia party have been industrious to injure my military character.\n\n                                                     I am, dear Sir,\n                                                     Yours sincerely,\n                                                     Henry Lee.\n\n\n\n\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                         Sept. 10, 1779.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccept my thanks for your favor of the 28th of August, and your\nobliging assurances that you will comply with my request. Unless my\nanxiety in the events of the campaign had been very great, I should\nnot have been so unreasonable as to impose this burthen on any of my\nmuch respected friends at head quarters; well knowing that they, of all\nothers, have the least leisure. I find the British reinforcement is\narrived. To me it brings no terror, as I think we have the strongest\nevidence that it was not originally intended to exceed four thousand\nmen, and these raw recruits. You say Wayne is still safe. Let him keep\na sharp look out; for I still hold the opinion, that Sir Henry Clinton\nis bound in honor to chastise him, for one of the most daring and\ninsolent assaults that is to be found in the records of chivalry; an\nachievement so brilliant in itself--so romantic in the scale of British\nadmiration--that none but a hero, inspired by the fortitude, instructed\nby the wisdom, and guided by the planet of Washington, could, by the\nexploit at Paulus Hook, have furnished materials in the page of history\nto give it a parallel. * * You see from this how much I am at my ease.\n\nTo know the value of domestic enjoyment, next to head quarters, I\nrecommend the chair at the Board of Treasury, for ten months of a\nsession, in which both our friends and foes are waging a successful war\nagainst the public credit.\n\nPresent my affectionate regard to His Excellency, and the family, and\nbelieve me, with every friendly sentiment,\n\n                                  Your affectionate and devoted servant,\n                                  James Duane.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\n\n\n                                    West Point, Sept. 14, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI do not recollect whether I said any thing in my last about the\nstrength of the reinforcement with Arbuthnot. All the accounts agree\nthat it does not exceed 3000, mostly recruits, and in very bad health;\nit is said more than a thousand died on the passage, and the greater\npart of the remainder are journeying fast to the other world. Disease\nprevails also in the other parts of the army and among the inhabitants,\nmore than has been known at any time, since the enemy has been in\npossession of the city. They have been of late making extensive\npreparations for embarking troops, and we have just received advice,\nthat two German and one British regiment sailed from New-York on the\n11th, under convoy of a Sixty-four. The rumors about the destination\nare various. The West Indies, Georgia, Canada, are all talked of, but\nthe first with most confidence, and is no doubt most probable; our\nintelligence announces a continuance of the embarkation.\n\nA vessel lately arrived at Boston from the Cape, reports that\nshe sailed from that place in company with Count DâEstaing, with\ntwenty-five sail of the line, and some transports, containing 6000\ntroops taken in at the Cape, and bound first for Georgia and afterward\nfarther Northward. She parted with the fleet in latitude 25, longitude\n74. Two other vessels, arrived at some place in Connecticut,\npretend that they parted with a French fleet of men of war, and\ntransports, in the latitude of Bermuda, steering for this coast. These\nconcurrent accounts are not entirely unworthy of attention, though I am\nnot disposed to give them entire credit.\n\nThe reduction of the enemyâs fleets and armies in this country, would\nbe the surest method to effect the complete conquest of the Islands;\nand it would be one of the most fatal strokes Great Britain could\nreceive. The stamina of their Military Establishment are in this\ncountry. The ruin of this, and the capture of their seamen and ships,\nwould be an irrecoverable loss. The West Indies would scarcely have\nany further prospect of succor, and would be obliged to submit to the\npower of France almost without resistance; which might then operate at\nleisure, aided by ample supplies from this continent, which I believe\nare the principal thing wanting.\n\nThese reasons may have induced the Count to make us a visit, during\nthe season of inactivity in the West Indies; or if he does not come\nhimself, if by forming a junction with the Spanish fleet, he can make\na detachment this way, and still maintain a superiority for operation\nin that quarter, this perhaps will make the event more probable, than\non the former supposition. I have now given you all the intelligence\nwe have, and have mixed certainties, rumors, and conjectures. You will\nextract and believe as much as you think proper. I shall only add, that\nI am with the most perfect esteem and attachment,\n\n                                                Dear Sir,\n                                                Your most obedât servât,\n                                                A. Hamilton.\n\nThe General and family charge me to present their most affectionate\nrespects. We are to receive the new Minister to-morrow morning.\n\n\n\n\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                     Manor of Livingston, 16th September, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Col.:\n\nI have had no earlier opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of your\nvery agreeable favor of the 7th instant. To yours of the ---- I\ntransmitted an answer by the post.\n\nI perfectly agree in opinion with you what the enemy ought in good\nfeeling to attempt; but as they uniformly contravene their best\ninterests, and pursue measures which can produce the least possible\nadvantage, I conclude they will not persevere in the system of\nattacking us in our weakest side--the Southern States. They may too,\nby this time, have some reason for declining what a more enterprising\npeople would hazard at any event. I think I intimated to you that I\nshould not be surprised if Count DâEstaing paid a visit to our coast\nthis fall. Reports prevail which announce his approach. In that case\nthey will be as safe in New-York as at Savannah or Charleston; and\nit is no slander to say, that the _safety_ of their army has all\nalong been their first object. I have many reasons to be anxious for\nthe expedition against the Six Nations. No less than the safety of\nour Northern and Western frontiers depends upon its success; to say\nnothing of the vast national advantages which will be derived from the\nreduction of these perfidious savages. By the way, what will the world\nthink of our spirit and our resources, when at the very instant our\nenemies, foreign and domestic, pronounced our immediate ruin from the\nembarrassment of our finances, and a series of heavy calamities under\nwhich they affirmed we were expiring, they see their grand army cooped\nup in a garrison; their forts taken from them by unparalleled bravery;\nthe country of their Indian allies ravaged and destroyed without\na single effort for their protection; and a capital naval armament\nequipped by a single State, which it required misconduct _perhaps_,\non our part, and _certainly_ the most hazardous efforts on theirs, to\ndefeat! I wait with great impatience for further intelligence from\nGeneral Sullivanâs army. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the\ncountry to form a clear idea of their intended route; but if they\nvisit the Senecas effectually, I suppose we soon shall hear from them\nat Conodeseraga, the chief Seneca town, where our State, so long ago\nas 1732, made a large purchase for a settlement, to keep them in, but\nwhich was not prosecuted on account of the turbulent and faithless\ntemper of the Senecas, and the want of vigor in our own Government.\n\nI must close, or lose the opportunity by a sloop passing to New\nWindsor. Be so good as to pay my most respectful compliments to His\nExcellency, the family, Generals McDougal, Greene and Knox, and _if he\nis still safe_, to G. Wayne; and believe me to be with great regard,\nand a disposition to do you every possible service,\n\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             Jas. Duane.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                         Manor Livingston, 23d September, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI am obliged much by your kind attention to me. The condition of our\nenemies, instead of being formidable, as they predicted, seems daily\nto become more feeble; and instead of those vigorous and decisive\noperations, which could alone have revived their declining cause, and\nkept up the spirits of their infatuated adherents, we see nothing but\nlanguor, discontent, and disgust in their army, their fields, and their\ncouncils. Their king alone, as if literally hardened by a judicial\nblindness, persists in his obstinate folly, and courts the destruction\nof the British Empire. If, in addition to all his other wants,\ndistresses, and misfortunes, sickness has taken a deep root among his\ntroops, and his partisans; a decisive period must in all probability be\nspeedily put to the mad career.\n\nCount dâEstaing seems to have the ball at his feet. His command of\nthe ocean must be indisputable when he is joined by the Spanish\nsquadron lately at Havana. He may divide his force, subdue the West\nIndia Islands, and assist us in expelling or captivating the remnant\nof our enemies on this continent. I have, however, some distrust of\nthe Countâs _planet_. His former ill luck on our coast has led me to\nthink that he is no _Felix_. I conclude not much from the advantages\nhe acquired over Biron; for that man is marked for the child of\nmisfortune, and I dare say if his nativity was cast, it would appear\nthat his star foreboded decapitation and disgrace. Believe me, I never\nmeddled with the black art, nor am I over superstitious, and yet I\ndiscern that I am not altogether free from a prejudice which was very\nremarkable in the greatest nation of antiquity. Hence it is that I so\nanxiously look for the fortunate completion of our western expedition;\neven when a train of favorable events renders it so highly probable.\n\nBe so good as to present my affectionate and respectful compliments to\nthe General and all the family; and believe that I shall be happy in\nevery opportunity to convince you that I am sincerely,\n\n                                                  Your friend and\n                                                  Most obedient servant,\n                                                  Jas. Duane.\n\nP. S. How do you like the new Minister of France? I have a letter from\nG. Schuyler. In the course of a week I expect him here, and shall\nprobably accompany him on a visit to the General and our friends at\nhead quarters.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\n\n\n                                                        October 1, 1779.\n\nI am much obliged to you, my dear sir, for your two letters of the\n16th and 23d. In haste I snatch up my pen by an express going off to\nthe Governor, to give you the news as it runs. The most important and\nbest authenticated is, that Count DâEstaing was arrived on the coast of\nGeorgia. The tale runs thus. We are in possession of a Charleston paper\nof the 6th of September, which mentions that the Viscount de Fontagnes\nhad arrived at that place, sent by the Count to announce his approach.\nMr. Mitchel, who transmits the paper, adds,--that by the express\nwhich brought it, Mr. Gerard had received dispatches from the Count,\ninforming him of his intention to attack the enemy in Georgia on the\n9th; that in consequence of this intelligence Mr. Gerard had postponed\nhis voyage a few days to be the bearer of the event. This, I hope, puts\na period to the danger of the Southern States, for which I could not\nhelp having strong apprehensions, notwithstanding the presumption drawn\nfrom the enemiesâ past folly against their pursuing any plan favorable\nto their interest. I acknowledge the force of the argument, but I was\nafraid they might for once blunder upon the right way. The departure of\nCornwallis on the 25th, with the Grenadiers, Light Infantry, and one\nBritish regiment, had increased my horrors on this subject. The nature\nof this corps pointed to a temporary service for some important coup\nde main. Charleston presented itself as the only object. They would\nhardly separate the flower of their troops for any remote and permanent\nstation. They are continuing their embarkation. The accounts we have\nof the particular corps carry them to between five and six thousand.\nI send you a Boston paper of the 23d, containing some interesting\nEuropean advices.\n\n                          Your most respectful and affectionate servant,\n                          Alex. Hamilton.\n\nP. S. The General is happy in the hopes you give him of a speedy\nvisit from General Schuyler and yourself, and orders me to present his\nrespects to both. The family join in every sentiment of perfect esteem.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO COUNT DâESTAING.\n\n\n                  Head Quarters, West Point, October 7th, 1779.\n\nSir:\n\nSince my letter to your Excellency on the 4th instant, I have had\nthe honor of a visit from his Excellency, Monsieur Gerard. In the\nconversation we had relative to a co-operation with the fleet and\ntroops under your command, he expressed his doubts of its being\npossible for you to continue such a length of time as may be essential\nto the success of the undertaking, and which alone could justify me\nin going into those extensive preparations absolutely necessary on\nour part. I have therefore appointed Brigadier General Du Portail and\nColonel Hamilton to wait upon your Excellency as speedily as possible,\nand explain to you fully my ideas of the proposed co-operation--the\nmeans we shall be able to employ--the obstacles we shall have to\nencounter on our side--the plans which it may be proper to pursue,\nand the measures which are taking and may be taken by the enemy to\ncounteract them. This will enable your Excellency to determine what you\ncan with propriety undertake. I shall only add, that if your Excellency\nwill engage to co-operate with your whole naval and land force against\nthe enemyâs fleet and army at New-York, till the winter is so far\nadvanced that the ice will make it impracticable to remain with your\nfleet any longer in port, I will bring twenty-five thousand effective\nmen into the field, and will exert all the resources of the country in\na vigorous and decided co-operation. Without this assurance on the part\nof your Excellency, it would be inconsistent with my duty to the public\nand to the common cause, to incur the expense and hazard which would be\ninseparable from the enterprise, and the more disagreeable consequences\nwhich would attend a failure. I flatter myself your Excellency will be\nfully sensible of the weight of the reasons, on which this declaration\nis founded, and will approve the frankness with which it is made, and\nwith which I have instructed General Du Portail and Colonel Hamilton to\ndisclose to you every circumstance, and every consideration with which\nit is necessary you should be acquainted. If your determination should\nbe in favor of the enterprise, I request you will honor me with a line\nin answer to this letter, expressive of your ultimate intentions, and\nthat you will communicate to the gentlemen who now wait upon you, the\nprevious measures you propose to pursue, and your sentiments of the\nmost eligible plan of co-operation. I shall act in consequence, till\nthe period arrives for concerting a final and more determinate plan.\n\nI would now observe to your Excellency, that you may repose the most\nimplicit confidence in General Du Portail and Colonel Hamilton, and\naccordingly I recommend them to your kind civilities and attention.\nAnd, having done this, I have only to renew the assurances of that\nsincere attachment and perfect respect with which I have the honor to be\n\n                                                 Your Excellencyâs\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\n                                                 G. Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHENRY LEE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                 Mandlopen, October 15th, 1779.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 9th and 18th October. The pilots have orders\none half to proceed to Lewistown, there to wait on you.\n\nThe route I cannot yet determine, as I am not sufficiently acquainted.\nThey will be sent the shortest, and every assistance given them to\nexpedite their arrival.\n\nShould you leave the Capes before they get there, it would be\nnecessary to dispatch a courier to cross at Dover and pursue the Jersey\nroute with directions for them. Yourself or courier must meet them.\n\nMy intelligence corresponds exactly with the information obtained from\nCaptain Monroe and transmitted you from head quarters.\n\nRhode Island was not evacuated when my last accounts arrived, but\nwill be on the Countâs appearance. Transports are ready there for the\npurpose.\n\nSandy Hook, the Narrows, and Governorâs Island are strongly fortified.\nBe assured of my execution of your wishes, and that\n\n                                           I am your friend and servant,\n                                           Henry Lee.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON AND DU PORTAIL.\n\n\n                               Head Quarters, West Point, Oct. 18, 1779.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have been favored with Colonel Hamiltonâs letter, mentioning your\narrival early on the 11th, at Philadelphia, and your being about to set\noff for Lewistown on the morning on which it was written.\n\nI have attentively considered the object to which you more particularly\nrefer, and am now to authorize you (provided the Count will not\ndetermine on a co-operation to the full extent of my instructions), to\nengage the whole force described in my letters to him, comprehending\nthe Continental troops and militia, in such an enterprise against\nthe enemyâs shipping, as the Count and you may agree to undertake.\nIn a word, I will aid him in every plan of operations against the\nenemy at New-York, or Rhode Island, in the most effectual manner that\nour strength and resources will admit. He has nothing more to do,\ntherefore, than to propose his own plan, if time will not admit him\nto accede to ours; weighing thoroughly, consequences of expense and\ndisappointment.\n\nInclosed is some intelligence received from Elizabethtown since your\ndeparture. You will observe the preparations of the enemy for throwing\nevery possible obstruction in the Countâs passage.\n\nA chain of alarm ships are stationed in the Sound, to communicate the\nfirst approach of the Countâs fleet to the garrison at Rhode Island.\nThis they can propagate in a few minutes by signal guns. In a letter\nfrom General Gates of the 13th instant, he advises me of the arrival\nof the fleet, which some time ago sailed from New-York. It amounts to\nfifty-six sail, and appeared to be only in a set of ballast. This was\nconfirmed by one of the vessels which fell into our hands for a few\nhours. The opinion is, that it is designed to take off the garrison.\n\nGeneral Gates makes the marine force at Newport, one fifty, and a\nthirty-two gun frigate. The Refugee and Wood fleet, about thirty-seven\nsail, mostly armed, at the head of which is the Restoration, late the\nOliver Cromwell, of twenty-two guns. One frigate is also taken notice\nof in the fleet from New-York.\n\nShould the operations against New-York, in either case, be undertaken,\nit will be of the utmost consequence to block up the garrison at Rhode\nIsland. You will consider the propriety of suggesting to the Count,\nthe detaching of a superior sea force for this purpose, previous to\nhis approaching the Hook. For, should the measure be deferred till his\narrival there, it may not then be possible to prevent their junction\nwith the army at New-York, as the notice can be so very suddenly\ntransmitted by means of the signals which they have established.\n\nEvery proper attention has been given to preparing the necessary\nnumber of fascines, and such other materials as may be requisite in\nthis quarter. Fascines, gabions, etc., are also held in readiness at\nProvidence in case of an operation against Newport. I had thought\nof the fire ships, and have taken order in the matter. I do not,\nhowever, choose to go to the great expense they must run us into, till\nsomething is decided with His Excellency Count DâEstaing; but every\nthing relative shall be provided, so as to occasion no delay when such\nmatters become necessary.\n\n                                             I am, Gentlemen,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             G. Washington.\n\nBrigadier-General Du Portail.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON AND DU PORTAIL.\n\n\n                                  West Point, October 21, 1779.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn my letters of the tenth and eighteenth, I transmitted all the\nintelligence I had obtained respecting the enemy, from the time of\nyour departure to those two periods: and by the present conveyance, I\ninclose you an extract of a letter from Major-General Gates, of the\n15th. By this you will perceive, he was fully persuaded that the enemy\nare now preparing to evacuate Rhode Island; and he expected, from his\nadvices, they would do it on Monday or Tuesday last.\n\nWhether the event has taken place, or not, as yet, is a matter I cannot\ndetermine, having received no information since upon the subject. But\nadmitting it has not, there is no room to doubt that they have all\nthings in a condition to do it, on the shortest notice, whenever they\nshall think the exigency of their affairs requires it. It is also\nequally certain, that they continue to carry on their fortifications\nfor the defence of New-York with the utmost industry and perseverance;\nand appear to be providing for the most obstinate resistance. Indeed,\nas their reduction would be attended with the most alarming and fatal\nconsequences to their nation, nothing else can be reasonably expected.\nThe moment I hear the troops have left Rhode Island, I will advise you.\n\nThe garrisons at Verplanckâs and Stony Points, still remain; but from\nthe concurring accounts of deserters, the heavy baggage and stores,\nexcept about eighteen or twenty rounds for each cannon, are embarked,\nand all matters are putting in train for an evacuation, in case\nevents make it necessary. The deserters add, as a circumstance of\nconfirmation, that Sir Henry Clinton was up at the posts about eight\ndays ago; and that, from that time, they have totally declined carrying\non any works.\n\nHaving given you the substance of the intelligence received since my\nlast, I am led (from the vast magnitude of the object which carried\nyou from head quarters, and the very interesting consequences it may\ninvolve, all of which I am persuaded will occur to your consideration)\nto remark, that the Countâs entering New-York Bay with his fleet,\nmust be the basis and groundwork of any co-operation that can be\nundertaken by us, either for the reduction of the enemyâs whole force,\nor the destruction of their shipping only. Every thing will absolutely\ndepend upon it, in either case; as, without it, and a free and open\ncommunication up and down the rivers, and in the Sound, which cannot\nbe effected and maintained in any other way, we could not possibly\nundertake any operations on Long Island, as our supplies of provisions\nand stores could only be obtained by water.\n\nThis point, I am certain, would have your due consideration; but it\nappearing to me the hinge, the one thing upon which all others must\nrest, I could not forbear mentioning it. The circumstance of the\nseason now, the expenditure of wood, and the necessity of supplying\nit, etc., will of course be fully attended to, according to their\nimportance: and I have only to add, from a desire of preventing a\nmisconception by either side, if any co-operation is agreed on, that\nthe terms and conditions may be explicitly understood. And whether it\nshall extend to an attempt to reduce the enemyâs whole force, or only\nto the destruction of their shipping; your engagements will provide\nfor the continuance of the Countâs fleet, to secure our retreat, and\nthe removal of our stores from Long and York Islands, if, unhappily,\nit should be found, on experiment, that neither is practicable, and we\nshould be obliged to abandon the enterprise.\n\n                                          I am, Gentlemen,\n                                          With great regard and respect,\n                                          Your most obedient servant,\n                                          G. Washington.\n\nP. S. 1-4 after three, P. M. Three deserters have just come in, who\nleft Verplanckâs Point last night. They all corroborate the accounts,\nby a detail of circumstances, of the preparations to evacuate both that\nand Stony Point. I have no doubt that things will at least be held in\nreadiness.\n\n                                                 G. Washington.\n\nAfter dispatching the above, I received a letter from Major-General\nHeath, of which the following is a copy.\n\nâI now have the pleasure to acquaint your Excellency, that the enemy\nhave left both Points, having burnt and destroyed their works.â\n\nGeneral Du Portail.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n  Mandevilleâs, Oct. 21, 1779. 4 oâclock, P. M.\n\n\n\n\nHENRY LEE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Monmouth, Oct. 22d, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI received your two letters announcing your object, route and wishes.\nI sent to you at Lewistown two pilots; one of them Captain Schuyler,\nfrom whom you may know more than from any other, as he was particularly\nactive.\n\nThe enemyâs strength at the Hook consists in two 64âs, the Europa and\nRussell; the Raisonable, Renown, Roebuck and Romulus.\n\nBesides these they have ten frigates and some armed schooners. They\nhave sunk ten hulks in the outer channel, and have more ready to be\nsunk; some of those sunk have got afloat and reached shore.\n\nThey have also two fire ships. My latest accounts from New-York,\nmention that all was attention and labor among the troops. Works are\nerecting on both sides the Narrows and on Governorâs Island. Head\nquarters in Long Island. Evacuation of Rhode Island not yet taken\nplace. A vessel got in on the 16th from Georgia, since whose arrival,\nthe two 64âs, and the Renown have fallen down to New-York.\n\nThe troops have embarked from the Hook and gone to the city.\n\nI construe these movements as indicatory of the Countâs withdrawal from\nthe coast. Do write me whenever you may hear certainly from the fleet.\nYou will regularly be informed of what passes here.\n\n                                                   I am, dear Sir,\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\n                                                   Henry Lee.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nMITCHELL TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Philadelphia, 23d October, 1779.\n\nSir:\n\nYour favor of the 18th instant from Lewistown, came duly to hand, and\nin consequence of your request, expresses have been stationed at proper\ndistances on the road between this and Lewistown.\n\nYours of the 19th from Egg Harbor, came to hand at half-past two, and\nyours of the 22d instant, from Col. Westcoatâs, came to hand at three\noâclock this afternoon.\n\nI shall only observe in answer to your last note, which came unsealed,\nthat you have met with no delays from me, since your arrival in this\ncity from His Excellencyâs head quarters, nor shall any delays or\nneglects be given you by the Department that I can prevent.\n\nYour letter to the President of Congress is delivered. I have shown\nhim yours to me. Congress is now sitting, but I shall wait till they\nrise in order that his dispatches may go with this conveyance; three\nexpresses set out with this to attend any orders you may have to\ndispatch. If you find more necessary, you shall have them. I had\nletters from His Excellency yesterday, but none for you or General\nPortail. This day letters came from Charleston, which mention that all\nthe British forces in Carolina and Georgia had got to Savannah, where\nthey were invested by the Count DâEstaing, and the American forces. He\nhad carried his approaches within four hundred yards of their works,\nand expected they would surrender in two or three days; the Experiment\ntaken, and several other ships and their naval force destroyed: but I\nexpect the President will give you a more particular account; those\naccounts are by private letters of good authority. Mr. Laurens was my\ninformant.\n\nI have sent you per the express, Mr. Trueman Kirk of OâMooney, four\nhorses, the best I can procure in so short a time; one of them is a\nhorse you left here. It is with great difficulty horses can be procured\nsufficient to do the public business.\n\nThe President of Congress informs me he cannot write at present. The\naccounts from the southward are as late as the 4th instant, on which\nday the Countâs batteries were to open.\n\n                  I am with esteem and complâts to General Portail--Sir,\n                  Your most obedât servant,\n                  Jno. Mitchell,\n                  _D. Q. Mst._\n\nA letter from His Excellency for you and Gen. Portail was sent to\nLewistown on the 19th inst., but suppose it will be returned; if so, no\ntime shall be lost in sending it.\n\nCol. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON AND DU PORTAIL.\n\n\n                   Head Quarters, West Point, October 25, 1779.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have just received a letter from Colonel Hamilton, mentioning your\nhaving changed your position, at Lewistown, for that of Little Egg\nHarbor; and that you would write me more fully on your arrival at the\nFurnace. In my last I informed you that the enemy had evacuated both\ntheir posts at Kingâs Ferry; since which, no alteration has taken place\nthat has come to my knowledge. Things at Rhode Island remain in the\nsame situation; at least I have received no accounts, either confirming\nor contradicting my former intelligence.\n\n                                        I am, Gentlemen, your most obât,\n                                        Humble servant,\n                                        G. Washington.\n\nGen. Du Portail.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nDU PORTAIL AND HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                    Great Egg Harbor Landing, October 26, 1779.\n\nSir:\n\nWe are honored with two letters from your Excellency, of the 10th\nand 21st; to the contents of which we beg leave to assure you of our\nstrictest attention.\n\nThat of the 18th has not yet come to hand. It is not improbable, it has\ngone round by Lewistown, which has occasioned the delay.\n\nColonel Hamilton wrote to your Excellency from Philadelphia,\nacquainting you with our arrival there, and our intention to proceed\nto Lewistown, Cape Henlopen, and from Great Egg Harbor, communicating\nour progress since, and our determination to establish ourselves at\nBat Stove Furnace. We have since fixed on this place, about forty-four\nmiles from the extremity of Cape May (eighteen miles short of the\nFurnace, which we found to be more remote than had been represented),\nand, as far as we have been able to learn, from 100 to 110 miles of\nSandy Hook, and about 50 from Philadelphia. Your Excellency will easily\nperceive the reason of our choosing this station. It did not appear to\nus, from our inquiries in Philadelphia, to be a point well ascertained,\nthat the fleet would stop at the Delaware; and the time which had\nelapsed, made it more possible, if the Count should be determined to\nprosecute any further operations on the continent, that he would not\nlose time by a procedure of this sort, but might content himself with\nsending some transports, under escort of a few frigates, to receive the\nprovisions for the fleet, and proceed himself directly on to the Hook.\nOn this supposition, our position at Lewistown was entirely ineligible.\nThe distance at which we were from the city, as well as from the Hook;\nthe delays that would consequently attend our intelligence from every\nquarter; the difficulty and impossibility, sometimes, of traversing\nthe Bay, made our first situation inconvenient in every respect, in\nthe event of the fleetâs proceeding immediately to the Hook. These\nconsiderations induced us to cross the Delaware, and take the position\nat which we now are; where, or in the vicinity, we propose to remain\ntill the arrival of the Count; till intelligence from him decides the\ninutility of a longer stay; or till we receive your Excellencyâs orders\nof recall.\n\nWe have now a better relation to the different points in which we\nare interested, and have taken the necessary precautions to gain the\nearliest notice of whatever happens. We have stationed expresses at\nthe pitch of the Cape, and have established a regular communication\nwith Major Lee, and with the city. If the fleet should appear off the\nDelaware, we can be there in twelve hours after its first appearance;\nand if at the Hook, in less than four days; provided Major Lee is\npunctual in conveying the intelligence, and the expresses, from either\nside, in bringing it.\n\nBy recent information from Philadelphia (though not quite so distinct\nand accurate as we could wish), we find, that so late as the fourth of\nthis month, the Count, as yet, was to open his batteries against the\nenemy at Savannah. The time that will probably intervene between this\nand the final reduction; the re-embarkation of the Countâs troops; the\ndispositions for sailing, and his arrival on this coast; may, we fear,\nexhaust the season too much to permit of the co-operation to which our\nmission relates.\n\nWe do not, however, despair; for if the Count has been fully\nsuccessful to the southward, and should shortly arrive (which may be\nthe case), the enterprise may possibly go on.\n\nIn a letter from Major Lee, of the 22d, he informs us, that a vessel\nfrom Georgia arrived on the 16th; since which the two sixty-fours, and\nthe Renown, which were at the Hook, had fallen down towards New-York;\nand the troops at the Hook had embarked and gone to the city. At first\nsight, this account alarmed us, and made us apprehensive that the enemy\nhad received some favorable advices from the southward, which put\nthem out of danger, and superseded the necessity of continuing their\npreparations for defence. But, on further reflection, we think it more\nprobable, that this is only a change of disposition; and that finding,\non closer examination, they would be unable to defend the Hook, they\nhad determined to relinquish the attempt.\n\nThis seems the more likely, as Major Lee mentions, that a part of the\nhulks, sunk in the channel, had gotten afloat and drifted ashore.\n\nTo this experience of the difficulty of obstructing the channel, may,\nperhaps, be attributed the change we suppose. And we are confirmed in\nthis conjecture, by the evacuation of the two posts at Kingâs Ferry,\nwhich appears, by your Excellencyâs letter, to have taken place on the\n21st, five days after the supposed arrival of the vessel from Georgia;\na proof that they had not received information of any decisive good\nfortune on their side, or ill fortune on ours; and that they persisted\nin their defensive plan. We are persuaded, too, that their exultation\nwould have given wings to any good news they might have received,\nand that it would have reached us before this. Were the season less\nadvanced, we should regret this change of disposition; because we\nbelieve the attempt to defend the entrance of the Hook would have been\nfruitless; and it might have thrown a part of their ships, and of their\ntroops, into our hands, in the first instance, which could not fail to\nfacilitate the successive operations.\n\nBut, at this late period, it may rather be an advantage. To force the\npassage, might have required land operations against the Hook, which\nwould lose time and expose the fleet to the hazard of winds, which\nwould have rendered its situation critical. Now, the fleet may probably\nenter the bay, on its first approach, and be in security: and the whole\noperation will be brought to a point, and may demand less time for its\naccomplishment.\n\nAs a large number of fascines, ready for use, appear to us essential\nto any operations that may be undertaken, we presume your Excellency\nhas been preparing, and will continue to prepare as many as possible.\nWe beg leave to suggest the utility of having, at the same time, a\nsufficient number of gabions and sand bags. Of the former, Colonel\nGouvion, if your Excellency thinks proper, may be charged with\nthe constructing: the latter may be made under the care of the\nQuarter-Master at Philadelphia. Several thousands may be necessary. The\nusual dimensions are fifteen or eighteen inches long, and twelve wide.\nIf notwithstanding the advices from Major Lee, any thing by land is to\nbe attempted against the Hook, these will be peculiarly useful on such\na flat, sandy spot; and, indeed, it would be impracticable to construct\nbatteries, in any reasonable time, without them.\n\n                                             We have the honor to be,\n                                             Sir, your most obedient and\n                                             Humble servants,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n                                             Du Portail.\n\nHis Excellency Gen. Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHENRY LEE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                       October 29, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI have nothing new since my last; only a report aboard the Navy at the\nHook, purporting two naval actions, the one in the English Channel\nbetween the grand fleets: the second in the West Indies: in the former\nthe British were worsted; the Ardent, man-of-war, Admiral Gambier,\nsunk, and the fleet drove into two different ports where they were\nblocked up; in the latter the French were much damaged, and four of\ntheir capital ships taken.\n\nLt. Col. Simcoe has made lately a very extraordinary tour to\nMiddlebrook: he burnt the boats, magazine of forage, court-house,\nmeeting-house, took two officers at Mr. Vanhornâs, and lost himself\nnear Brunswick. The party got safe to South Amboy. I send you a letter\nfrom head quarters.\n\n                                                   Adieu.\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\n                                                   Henry Lee.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON AND DU PORTAIL.\n\n\n                   Head Quarters, West Point, November 1, 1779.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have this day been favored with yours of twenty-sixth ult.,\ninforming me of your removal to Great Egg Harbor. My letter of the\neighteenth, which had not reached you, went, as you supposed, by way of\nPhiladelphia; and, lest any accident may have happened to it, I inclose\nyou a duplicate. Mine of the thirtieth ultimo, which went through Major\nLee, informed you of the evacuation of Rhode Island. I have since\nreceived a letter of the twenty-first ultimo, from my confidential\ncorrespondent in New-York. He informs me that Rawdonâs corps, the 57th,\nand some of the artillery, were then embarked: and it was said, and\ngenerally believed, that they were bound to Halifax. That the Robuste,\nof seventy-four guns, had arrived the twentieth, from Halifax; and that\na number of transports were taking in water and ballast. He gave me\nnothing further worth communicating.\n\nYou will find, by the letter of the 18th, that a provision of\nfascines and gabions was making; and I shall give directions to the\nQuarter-Master-General, to provide a quantity of sand bags.\n\nI am sorry to inform you, that Colonel La Rodiere died on Saturday\nlast. He is to be buried this day with the honors due to his rank.\n\n                                     I am, with great esteem, Gentlemen,\n                                     Your most obedient servant,\n                                     G. Washington.\n\nP. S. Upon a presumption that Colonel Laurens will be on board the\nfleet, the inclosed are sent to you.\n\nBrigadier-General Du Portail.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO DU PORTAIL AND HAMILTON.\n\n\n                   Head Quarters, West Point, November 2, 1779.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nSince mine of yesterday, I have received another letter from my\nconfidential correspondent in New-York, dated the twenty-ninth ultimo.\nHe informs me, that the fifty-seventh regiment, Rawdonâs corps, and the\nartillery mentioned in his last, were to sail on that day for Halifax;\nand with them, all the heavy ships of war, except the Europa. The\nDaphne frigate, with Sir George Collier and Colonel Stewart on board,\nwas to sail for England the same day. He says the pilots reported, that\nit was now difficult to bring a vessel into the Hook, on account of\nthe hulks sunk there. (By this it would seem that some of them still\nremained upon the shoals.) He says the transports mentioned in his\nlast, as taking in water and ballast, only carried it down to the ships\nat the Hook. The Rainbow, of forty guns, had arrived from Halifax. He\ninforms me of no other circumstances that materially relate to affairs\nin New-York. He says a packet arrived from England on the twenty-third\nOctober. The accounts brought by her seemed to alarm the tories very\nmuch. It was reported that the Ardent, of sixty-four guns, had been\ntaken, and the English fleet chased into Portsmouth by the combined\nfleet, which remained off that place several days. He mentions these\nmatters as current reports, and adds, that a fleet of victuallers were\nto sail from Cork the latter end of September, and another of store\nships and merchantmen, from Spithead, about the same time.\n\n                                     I am, with great regard, Gentlemen,\n                                     Your most obedient servant,\n                                     G. Washington.\n\nThe capture of the Ardent is confirmed by a New-York paper of the\ntwentieth ultimo.\n\nGeneral Du Portail and Colonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nDU PORTAIL TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                            Samedi Matin, 1779.\n\nMon Cher Colonel:\n\nJâai beaucoup revÃ© depuis hier Ã  lâaffaire de Caroline, et je trouve\ntoujours dans ma tÃªte les mÃªmes choses, la mÃªme faÃ§on de voir, les\nmÃªmes dispositions, que je vais vous expliquer en deux mots. Je serais\ncertainement bien aise dâaller en Caroline pendant cet hiver, mais je\nne voudrais pas absolument le demander, parce que, si je le demande, on\nne me saura plus de grÃ©, que je nâirai pas avec le mÃªme agrÃ©ment, que\nje ne pourrai faire aucune espÃ¨ce dâarrangements qui me donne le moyen\ndâÃªtre vraiment utile lÃ -bas, quâil me vaudra voyager Ã  mes dÃ©pens, ce\nque lâÃ©tat de mes finances ne me permet pas, etc., etc. Je ne dÃ©sire\ndonc y aller que dans le cas oÃ¹ le CongrÃ¨s ayant par exemple assez\nbonne opinion de moi pour croire que dans le moment critique je puis\nÃªtre nÃ©cessaire dans le pays, il penserait de lui mÃªme ou averti par\nquelquâun Ã  mây envoyer, ne pourriez vous donc pas mon cher Colonel,\nÃ  propos de la demande du GÃ©neral Washington au CongrÃ¨s, observer,\n_comme de vous mÃªme_, au GÃ©neral, que si je voulais aller passer mon\nhiver en Caroline cela serait peut-Ãªtre fort avantageux. Si le\nGÃ©neral le jugeait ainsi, probablement, il vous demanderait si vous\ncroyez que cela me convient dâailleurs et me fait plaisir. Sur cela\nvous pourriez lui rÃ©pondre que vous en Ãªtes persuadÃ©, et que je vous\nai fait entrevoir mÃªme que dans cette circonstance, je dÃ©sirerais que\nle GÃ©neral et le CongrÃ¨s jugeassent Ã  propos de mâenvoyer dans le sud,\nmais pour le moment de crise seulement, souhaitant de revenir pour ses\nordres au commencement de la CongrÃ¨s prochaine. Le GÃ©neral prendrait\ndonc la rÃ©solution pour cela de me donner les ordres nÃ©cessaires,\nsi je nâai besoin que des siens, ou sâil pense que le CongrÃ¨s doit\nintervenir, dâexpliquer au CongrÃ¨s sa faÃ§on de penser Ã  cet Ã©gard. Ceci\nsuffit Ã  quelquâun dâaussi intelligent que vous, pour nÃ©gocier sous le\npied oÃ¹ je dÃ©sire, ainsi je laisse le reste Ã  faire Ã  votre amitiÃ©. Que\ncette lettre dâailleurs soit un secret entre nous, de quelque faÃ§on que\nlâaffaire tourne; mais je dÃ©sire absolument dâÃªtre gratifiÃ© en ceci.\nAdieu je vous attends Ã  dÃ®ner et jâai lâhonneur dâÃªtre.\n\n                                            General Du Portail.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO LAURENS.\n\n\nCold in my professions--warm in my friendships--I wish, my dear\nLaurens, it were in my power, by actions, rather than words, to\nconvince you that I love you. I shall only tell you, that till you bid\nus adieu, I hardly knew the value you had taught my heart to set upon\nyou. Indeed, my friend, it was not well done. You know the opinion I\nentertain of mankind; and how much it is my desire to preserve myself\nfree from particular attachments, and to keep my happiness independent\nof the caprices of others. You should not have taken advantage of my\nsensibility, to steal into my affections without my consent.\n\nBut as you have done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those\nwe love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed,\non one condition; that for my sake, if not for your own, you will\ncontinue to merit the partiality which you have so artfully instilled\ninto me. I have received your two letters: one from Philadelphia, the\nother from Chester. I am pleased with your success so far; and I hope\nthe favorable omens that precede your application to the Assembly,\nmay have as favorable an issue; provided the situation of affairs\nshould require it, which I fear will be the case. But, both for your\ncountryâs sake and for my own, I wish the enemy may be gone from\nGeorgia before you arrive; and that you may be obliged to return, and\nshare the fortunes of your old friends. In respect to the commission\nwhich you received from Congress, all the world must think your conduct\nperfectly right. Indeed, your ideas upon this occasion seem not to\nhave their wonted accuracy; and you have had scruples, in a great\nmeasure, without foundation. By your appointment as Aid-de-Camp to the\nCommander-in-Chief, you had as much the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel\nas any officer in the line. Your receiving a commission as\nLieutenant-Colonel, from the date of that appointment, does not, in\nthe least, injure or interfere with one of them; unless, by virtue of\nit, you are introduced into a particular regiment, in violation of the\nright of succession, which is not the case at present, neither is it\na necessary consequence. As you were going to command a battalion, it\nwas proper you should have a commission; and if this commission had\nbeen dated posterior to your appointment as Aid-de-Camp, I should have\nconsidered it derogatory to your former rank, to mine, and to that of\nthe whole corps. The only thing I see wrong in the affair is this:\nCongress, by their conduct, both on the former and present occasion,\nappear to have intended to confer a privilege, an honor, a mark of\ndistinction, a something upon you, which they withheld from other\ngentlemen of the family. This carries with it an air of preference,\nwhich, though we can all truly say we love your character and admire\nyour military merit, cannot fail to give some of us uneasy sensations.\nBut in this, my dear, I wish you to understand me well. The blame, if\nthere is any, falls wholly upon Congress. I repeat it, your conduct has\nbeen perfectly right, and even laudable. You rejected the offer when\nyou ought to have rejected it; and you accepted it when you ought to\nhave accepted it; and let me add, with a degree of over-scrupulous\ndelicacy. It was necessary to your project. Your project was the public\ngood; and I should have done the same. In hesitating, you have refined\non the refinements of generosity.\n\nThere is a total stagnation of news here. Gates has refused the Indian\ncommand. Sullivan is come to take it. The former has lately given a\nfresh proof of his impudence, his folly, and his *********. âTis no\ngreat matter; but a peculiarity in the case prevents my saying what.\n\nFleury shall be taken care of. All the family send love. In this, join\nthe General and Mrs. Washington; and what is best, it is not in the\nstyle of ceremony, but sincerity.\n\n\n\n\nLAURENS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Philadelphia, December 12, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nUpon my arrival here yesterday evening, I communicated the intelligence\nreceived from General Wayne, to the President of Congress and the\nFrench minister. The latter surprised me greatly, by informing me,\nthat only one 74 gun ship of the Count De Grasseâs division, and\nthe Fier Rodrigue, had arrived at Chesapeake. I am at a loss how to\naccount for the absence of the rest. They have not been within the\nreach of a superior enemyâs force: no storm has happened, within\nour knowledge, to drive them to any considerable distance from the\ncoast. It cannot rationally be supposed that the Count has received\ncountermanding orders, and that a capital ship of the line, together\nwith a very valuable warlike merchantman, is to be sacrificed. Be the\ncase as it may, all hopes of passing our reinforcement for the southern\ndepartment, by sea, are out of the question. The North Carolina\nBrigade, after profiting by the navigation of the Delaware as far as\nit would serve them, marched to the head of Elk. Thence they proceed,\nby water, across the Chesapeake, and up to Petersburgh, where they are\nto be overtaken by their wagons, and pursue the rest of their way by\nthe middle road to Charleston. This is the route marked by the Board\nof War, and a Committee of Congress appointed to confer with them;\nand I believe it was recommended by Doctor Burke, one of the North\nCarolina delegates lately from that country. It is intended that the\nVirginians should pursue the same as far as Petersburgh, where they\nare to take an upper road. In this route we do not avail ourselves of\nAlbemarle Sound. The going up the river to Petersburgh will certainly\nbe tedious; and four hundred miles land march is to be executed from\nthence. I communicated these objections to Mr. Matthews, and proposed\nthe route which the General pointed out; but the poverty of the country\nin provision, and the means of transporting the baggage of the troops,\nhe said, would outweigh the advantages of the water carriage and\ndirect road. I am by no means satisfied with the present arrangement,\nwhen I reflect how much more rapidly the British may convey their\nreinforcements: but all the inquiries I have made hitherto, have\nproduced nothing favorable to our plan. Indeed, in the present\nunguarded state of the Chesapeake, the British might render the passage\neven of that ineligible.\n\nMr. Serle, a member of Congress, who arrived in town last night from\nthe neighborhood of Major Leighâs post, asserts, that no transports\nwere at the Hook on Wednesday. Whether the British operations are\ndelayed by false rumors of Count De Grasseâs division; or whether\nthey have heard, as we have here, that Count DâEstaing was still\non the coast the twentieth of November, I cannot decide: but one\nwould be inclined to think, that they are disconcerted, either by\nfalse intelligence, or a total defect of it. I entreat you, my dear\nfriend, to transmit me the earliest and most accurate relation that\ncan be obtained, of the British movements; and enlighten me with your\nobservations upon them. Present my respects and love to our excellent\nGeneral and the family. May you enjoy all the pleasure, moral and\nphysical, which you promise yourself in winter quarters, and be as\nhappy as you deserve. Tell the Doctor I shall commit his darling to\nthe press this morning.\n\n                                                  Yours, ever,\n                                                  John Laurens.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLAURENS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Philadelphia, December 18, 1779.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nOn my arrival in town, I was informed by the President, that Congress\nhad suspended the business of appointing a secretary to their minister\nplenipotentiary at Versailles, until my return, in hopes that I might\nstill be prevailed upon to accept the office. I replied, that I thought\nmy letter upon the subject sufficiently explicit; and assured him of\nmy sincere desire to be excused from serving in that capacity at the\npresent juncture of our affairs.\n\nHe urged the unanimity of the choice with respect to me; the difficulty\nof uniting the suffrages of all parties, in case of a new nomination;\nand the advantages of this union. Several delegates of Congress\ndeclared to me the embarrassment of Congress since I had declined. One,\nin particular, suggested to me his apprehension of interest being made\nfor a late delegate of New-York, who is candidate for the office, and\nto whom the world, in general, allows greater credit for his abilities\nthan his integrity; and said, âhe was determined to oppose him with\nall his influence.â When I quitted town the sixteenth, these matters\ncrowded into my mind. I fell into a train of serious reflections and\nself-examination; endeavored to investigate whether I had acted\nconsonantly to the ÎºÎ±Î»Î¿Î½ ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î±Î³Î±Î¸Î¿Î½, and fulfilled the duties of a good\ncitizen in this transaction. In fine, I agitated the grand question,\nWhether a citizen has a right to decline any office to which his\ncountrymen appoint him; upon what that right is founded; and whether it\nexisted in my case.\n\nAfter undergoing the severest conflict that ever I experienced;\nsometimes reproaching, sometimes justifying myself; pursuing my\njourney, or turning retrograde; as the arguments on the one side or the\nother appeared to prevail; I determined that I had been deficient in\nthe duties of a good citizen. I returned to Philadelphia; communicated\nmy sentiments to the President and two other members; and declared\nto them, that I thought it incumbent on me, in the first place, to\nrecommend a person equally qualified in point of integrity, and much\nbetter in point of ability. That if, unhappily, they could not agree\nupon Colonel Hamilton, and that I was absolutely necessary to exclude\na dangerous person, or to prevent pernicious delays, I should think it\nmy duty to obey the orders of Congress. The persons now in nomination,\nare, Colonel Hamilton, Mr. Lovell, Mr. G. Morris, Major Stewart. I am\nsorry that you are not better known to Congress. Great stress is laid\nupon the probity and patriotism of the person to be employed in this\ncommission. I have given my testimony of you in this, and the other\nequally essential points.\n\nI am sorry to inform you, that the North Carolina brigade had not\nquitted Elk the sixteenth; having been detained by the ice.\n\nI am sorry to write you, just as I am on the wing. Be so good as to\nthank Tilghman for his letter. Inform him, from Mr. Mitchell, that his\nhabiliments are making.\n\n                                                My love as usual. Adieu.\n                                                John Laurens.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLAURENS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                              Charleston, 1779.\n\nTernant will relate to you how many violent struggles I have had\nbetween duty and inclination--how much my heart was with you, while I\nappeared to be most actively employed here. But it appears to me that I\nshould be inexcusable in the light of a citizen, if I did not continue\nmy utmost efforts for carrying the plan of the black levies into\nexecution, while there remains the smallest hopes of success.\n\nOur army is reduced to nothing almost, by the departure of the\nVirginians. Scottâs arrival will scarcely restore us to our ancient\nnumber. If the enemy destine the reinforcements from Great Britain\nto this quarter, as in policy they ought to do, that number will be\ninsufficient for the security of our country. The Governor, among other\nmatters to be laid before the House of Assembly, intends to propose the\ncompleting our continental battalions by drafts from the militia. This\nmeasure, I am told, is so unpopular that there is no hope of succeeding\nin it. Either this must be adopted, or the black levies, or the State\nwill fall a victim to the improvidence of its inhabitants.\n\nThe House of Representatives have had a longer recess than usual,\noccasioned by the number of members in the field. It will be convened,\nhowever, in a few days. I intend to qualify, and make a final effort.\nOh that I were a Demosthenes! The Athenians never deserved a more\nbitter exprobation than our countrymen.\n\nGeneral Clintonâs movements, and your march in consequence, made me\nwish to be with you. If any thing important should be done in your\nquarter, while I am doing daily penance here, and making useless\nharangues, I shall execrate my stars, and be out of humor with\nthe world. I entreat you, my dear friend, write me as freely as\ncircumstances will permit, and enlighten me upon what is going forward.\n\nAdieu. My love to our colleagues. I am afraid I was so thoughtless as\nto omit my remembrances to Gibbs. Tell him that I am always his sincere\nwell-wisher, and hope to laugh with him again ere long.\n\n                                                Adieu again. Yours ever,\n                                                John Laurens.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\n\n\nSir:\n\nThe present conjuncture is by all allowed to be peculiarly critical.\nEvery man of reflection employs his thoughts about the remedies\nproper to be applied to the national disorders; and every one,\nfrom a partiality to his own ideas, wishes to convey them to those\nwho are charged with the management of affairs. The channel of the\npublic papers, commonly made use of for the purpose, appears to me\nexceptionable on several accounts. It not only restrains a freedom\nof discussion, from the extreme delicacy of the subject; but the\ndiscussion itself increases the evil, by exposing our weak sides\nto the popular eye, and adding false terrors to those well-founded\napprehensions which our situation authorizes.\n\nInstead of pursuing this method, I prefer addressing myself to a member\nof that body, in whose power alone it is, by well-digested system, to\nextricate us from our embarrassments. I have pitched upon you, from a\npersonal knowledge of your abilities and zeal. If I offer any thing new\nand useful, I am persuaded you will endeavor to turn it to advantage.\nIf the contrary is the case, I am, at least, doing no harm. I shall\nonly have had the trouble of writing, and you of reading, a few useless\npages.\n\nThe object of principal concern is the state of our currency. In\nmy opinion, all our speculations on this head have been founded in\nerror. Most people think, that the depreciation might have been\navoided, by provident arrangements in the beginning, without any aid\nfrom abroad: and a great many of our sanguine politicians, till very\nlately, imagined the money might still be restored by expedients within\nourselves. Hence the delay in attempting to procure a foreign loan.\n\nThis idea proceeded from an ignorance of the real extent of our\nresources. The war, particularly in the first periods, required\nexertions beyond our strength, to which neither our population nor\nriches were equal. We have the fullest proof of this, in the constant\nthinness of our armies; the impossibility, at this time, of recruiting\nthem otherwise than by compulsion; the scarcity of hands in husbandry,\nand other occupations; the decrease of our staple commodities; and the\ndifficulty of every species of supply. I am aware that the badness of\nthe money has its influence; but it was originally an effect, not a\ncause, though it now partakes of the nature of both. A part of those\nevils would appear, were our finances in a more flourishing condition.\nWe experienced them before the money was materially depreciated; and\nthey contributed to its depreciation. The want of men soon obliged\nthe public to pay extravagant wages for them in every department.\nAgriculture languished from a defect of hands. The mechanic arts did\nthe same. The price of every kind of labor increased: and the articles\nof foreign commerce, from the interruption it received, more than kept\npace with other things.\n\nThe relative value of money being determined by the greater or less\nportion of labor and commodities which it will purchase; whatever these\ngained in price, that of course lost in value.\n\nThe public expenditures, from the dearness of every thing, necessarily\nbecame immense; greater in proportion than in other countries; and much\nbeyond any revenues which the best concerted scheme of finance could\nhave extracted from the natural funds of the State. No taxes, which\nthe people were capable of bearing, on that quantity of money which\nis deemed a proper medium for this country (had it been gold instead\nof paper), would have been sufficient for the current exigencies of\nGovernment.\n\nThe most opulent States of Europe, in a war of any duration, are\ncommonly obliged to have recourse to foreign loans or subsidies.[3]\nHow, then, could we expect to do without them, and not augment the\nquantity of our artificial wealth beyond those bounds which were proper\nto preserve its credit? The idea was chimerical.\n\nThe quantity of money formerly in circulation among us, is estimated\nat about thirty millions of dollars. This was barely sufficient for\nour interior commerce. Our exterior commerce was chiefly carried on\nby barter. We sent our commodities abroad, and brought back others\nin return. The balance of the principal branch was against us; and\nthe little _specie_ derived from others, was transferred directly to\nthe payment of that balance, without passing into home circulation.\nIt would have been impracticable, by loans and taxes, to bring such\na portion of the forementioned sum into the public coffers as would\nhave answered the purposes of the war: nor could it have spared so\nconsiderable a part, without obstructing the operations of domestic\ncommerce. Taxes are limited, not only by the quantity of wealth in a\nState, but by the temper, habits, and genius of the people; all which,\nin this country, conspired to render them moderate: and as to loans,\nmen will not be prevailed upon to lend money to the public when there\nis a scarcity, and they can find a more profitable way of employing it\notherwise, as was our case.\n\nThe ordinary revenues of the United Provinces amount to about\ntwenty-five millions of guilders; or two millions two hundred and\nfifty thousand pounds sterling per annum. This is, in proportion to\nits territory and numbers, the richest country in the world; and\nthe country where the people sustain the heaviest load of taxes.\nIts population is about equal to ours, two millions of souls. The\nburthens on the subject are so great, that it is by some held almost\nimpracticable, even on extraordinary emergencies, to enlarge the\nrevenues by new impositions. It is maintained, their dependence, in\nthese cases, must be on the extraordinary contributions of wealthy\nindividuals; with the aid of which, in some of their wars, they have\nraised four millions sterling a year. In a country possessed of so\nvast a stock of wealth, where taxes are carried to such a height;\nand where the means of paying them so infinitely exceed those in our\npower; if the national revenues only amount to the sum I have stated,\nhow inadequate must have been the product of any taxes we could have\nlevied, to the demands of the service! Loans, for the reason before\nhinted, would have been out of the question; at least, they would have\nbeen so trifling as to be an object of little importance. Suppose we\nshould have been able to raise a million sterling, annually; a sum\nthat probably would have exceeded our ability; how unequal would this\nhave been to our wants![4] No economy could have made it bear any\nproportion, especially if we recur to the causes already enumerated, by\nwhich the currency depreciated in its first stages.\n\nFrom these reasonings it results, that it was not in the power of\nCongress, when their emissions had arrived at the thirty millions of\ndollars, to put a stop to them.[5] They were obliged, in order to\nkeep up the supplies, to go on creating artificial revenues by new\nemissions; and as these multiplied, their value declined. The progress\nof the depreciation might have been retarded, but it could not have\nbeen prevented. It was, in a great degree, necessary.\n\nThere was but one remedy; a foreign loan. All other expedients should\nrather have been considered as auxiliary. Could a loan have been\nobtained, and judiciously applied, assisted by a vigorous system of\ntaxation, we might have avoided that excess of emissions which has\nruined the paper. The credit of such a fund would have procured loans\nfrom the moneyed and trading men within ourselves; because it might\nhave been so directed, as to have been beneficial to them in their\ncommercial transactions abroad.[6]\n\nThe necessity for a foreign loan is now greater than ever. Nothing else\nwill retrieve our affairs.\n\nThe wheels of Government, without it, cannot much longer be kept in\nmotion. Including Loan-office certificates, and State emissions,\nwe have about four hundred millions of dollars in circulation. The\nreal value of these, is less than seven millions, which is the true\ncirculating medium of these States: for though the price of specie is\nâ â â and the rate of exchange for sterling bills â â âthe nominal value\nof every commodity is at least sixty to one, on an average. All the\nreasonings against the possibility of raising the current expenses\non the foundation of thirty millions, apply to our present situation\nin the ratio of thirty to seven; that is, it is as thirty to seven\nless practicable now than when our emissions amounted to only thirty\nmillions. Could every dollar in circulation be brought annually\ninto the treasury, which never was effected in any country, and is\npolitically impossible, the revenue would not be equal to the yearly\nexpense.\n\nThe hope of appreciating the money, by taxes and domestic loans, is\nat an end. As fast as it could be received, it must be issued in the\ndaily expenditures. The momentary interval between its being drawn out\nof circulation and returning into it, would prevent its receiving the\nleast advantage.\n\nThese reasonings may appear useless, as the necessity of a foreign\nloan is now acknowledged, and measures are taking to procure it. But\nthey are intended to establish good principles; the want of which has\nbrought us to the desperate crisis we are arrived at, and may still\nbetray us into fatal mistakes.\n\nHow this loan is to be employed, is now the question; and its\ndifficulty equal to its importance! Two plans have been proposed: one,\nto purchase up at once, in specie, or sterling bills, all superfluous\npaper; and to endeavor, by taxes, loans, and economy, to hinder its\nreturning into circulation. The remainder, it is supposed, would then\nrecover its value. This, it is said, will reduce our public debt to the\nsterling cost of the paper.\n\nSuppose two hundred millions were to be purchased, and the rest called\nin by taxes. At â â â this would require bills to the amount\nof â â â of dollars. But I doubt whether four times this sum would be\nsufficient. The moment it was known such purchases were to be made,\nthe avarice of the speculators would begin to operate: the demand\nwould immediately occasion an artificial appreciation; each successive\nmillion would cost more than the preceding. But this appreciation\nwould be more relative to the purchasing medium than to the prices\nof commodities. The raising the value of the paper relative to the\nformer, would depend on the combination of a few artful individuals,\nand would be easily accomplished. The diminution of prices must be\nslow, as it implies a change in the sentiments of the body of the\npeople with respect to the money. A sudden revolution in the general\nrates of all the necessaries of life is not to be expected. The prices\nof these, as they have reached their present summit by degrees, must,\nby degrees, revert to their former station. The minds of the people\nwill not readily admit impressions in favor of the currency. All their\npast experience has given a habit of diffidence; and the epidemical\nspirit of extortion will maintain a violent struggle with whatever has\na tendency to produce a fall of prices. A permanent reduction of the\nquantity of circulating cash, will alone gradually effect it. But this\nwill not happen on the present plan.\n\nThe necessity of continuing the supplies at nearly the same rates now\ngiven (which would be the case if my reasonings are true), would have\nnearly the same effect mentioned with respect to taxes and domestic\nloans. The money would return into circulation almost as fast as it\nwas drawn out: and at the end of the year we should find our treasury\nempty; our foreign loan dissipated; and the state of our finances\nas deplorable as ever. At a moderate calculation, we should have\nspent ten or twelve millions of real dollars, for the sole purpose of\ncarrying on the war another year. It would be much better, instead\nof purchasing up the paper currency, to purchase the supplies out of\nour specie or bills. In the first instance, the public would suffer a\ndirect loss of the artificial appreciation, relative to the purchasing\nmedium: in the last, it would buy at the value of the commodities in\nspecie or bills.\n\nA great source of error in disquisitions of this nature, is the judging\nof events by abstract calculations; which, though geometrically true,\nare false as they relate to the concerns of beings governed more by\npassion and prejudice, than by an enlightened sense of their interests.\nA degree of illusion mixes itself in all the affairs of society. The\nopinion of objects has more influence than their real nature. The\nquantity of money in circulation is certainly a chief cause of its\ndecline: but we find it is depreciated more than five times as much as\nit ought to be by this rule. The excess is derived from opinion; a want\nof confidence. In like manner we deceive ourselves, when we suppose the\nvalue will increase in proportion as the quantity is lessened. Opinion\nwill operate here also; and a thousand circumstances may promote or\ncounteract the principle.\n\nThe other plan proposed, is to convert the loan into merchandise, and\nimport it on public account. This plan is incomparably better than\nthe former. Instead of losing on the sale of its specie or bills, the\npublic would gain a considerable profit on the commodities imported.\nThe loan would go much further this way, in supplying the expenses\nof the war; and a large stock of valuable commodities, useful to the\narmy and to the country, would be introduced. This would affect the\nprices of things in general, and assist the currency. But the arts\nof monopolizers would prevent its having so extensive and durable an\ninfluence as it ought to have.\n\nA great impediment to the success of this, as well as the former\nscheme, will be the vast sums requisite for the current expenses. The\narguments adduced in the former case are applicable here also, though\nnot with equal force. The necessity the public will be under of\nparting with its stock to defray the daily demands, will give designing\nmen an opportunity, by combinations not to purchase, to oblige it to\nsell at a rate below the real value of money. This they may the more\neasily effect, as the demand for foreign commodities is much less than\nformerly, on account of the general spirit of parsimony which has\nobtained from necessity, and the manufactures carried on in private\nfamilies for their own use. The greatest part of the country people now\nalmost entirely clothe themselves.\n\nThe public must either sell very cheap, to collect rapidly the\nsuperfluous paper in hopes of raising the value of the remainder; or\nit must sell very slow, to preserve the due proportion between the\narticles it has for sale and those it wants to buy. By pursuing the\nfirst method, it will soon exhaust its stock at a very considerable\nloss, and only give temporary relief to the currency. According to\nmy principle, though it sells cheap, it must still buy dear; and,\nconsequently, the money collected cannot remain in the treasury long\nenough to preserve the rise in its appreciated state. If it pursues the\nsecond method, the expenditures will be equal to the income; and though\nthe public will make the natural profits on its goods, as it will lay\nup nothing, it will do nothing towards the appreciation.[7]\n\nThe farmers have the game in their own hands, and will make it very\ndifficult to lower the prices of their commodities. For want of\nlaborers, there is no great superfluity of the most essential articles\nraised. These are things of absolute necessity, and must be purchased,\nas well by the other classes of society as by the public. The farmers,\non the contrary, if they do not like the price, are not obliged to\nsell; because they have almost every necessary within themselves; salt,\nand one or two more, excepted; which bear a small proportion to what\nis wanted from them; and which they can obtain, by barter, for other\narticles equally indispensable. Heavy taxes, it may be said, will\noblige them to sell; but they can pay, with a small part of what they\nhave, any taxes our legislatures will venture to impose, or would be\nable to enforce.\n\nOne measure, alone, can counterbalance these advantages of the farmers,\nand oblige them to contribute their proper quota to the support of\nGovernment: a tax in kind.\n\nThis ought instantly to begin throughout the States. The present\nquantity of cash, though nominally enormous, would, in reality, be\nfound incompetent to domestic circulation, were it not that a great\npart of our internal commerce is carried on by barter. For this reason,\nit is impossible, by pecuniary taxes, to raise a sum proportioned\nto the wants of the State. The money is no longer a general\nrepresentative; and when it ceases to be so, the State ought to call\nfor a portion of the thing represented; or, in other words, to tax in\nkind. This will greatly facilitate whatever plan of finance is adopted;\nbecause it will lessen the expenditures in cash, and make it the easier\nto retain what is drawn in.\n\nI said the demand for foreign goods is less than it formerly was. I\nmean there is not a demand for so large a quantity, which the reasons\nalready assigned clearly demonstrate; nor are the exorbitant rates now\ngiven any objection to this doctrine. There is an absolute scarcity\neven in comparison of the present consumption; and, of course, a demand\nfor what there is. But should an importation of two millions sterling\ntake place, the market would be glutted; and there would be no way of\nkeeping up the price, but by making very slow sales. A less quantity\nwould stand no chance of calling in the money, and keeping it in long\nenough to effect any thing in favor of its credit.\n\nI say nothing about the risk of importation. I do not believe we could\nobtain a convoy sufficient to justify our hazarding it without the\nprecaution of insurance. But with this expedient we are safe; and must\nbe satisfied with smaller profits for the sake of security.\n\nThis is a plan not altogether to be rejected. With prudent management\nit might enable us to carry on the war two or three years (which,\nperhaps, is as long as it may last); but if we should expect more from\nit, the restoration of the currency, we should be disappointed.\n\nThe only plan that can preserve the currency, is one that will make\nit the _immediate_ interest of the moneyed men to co-operate with\nGovernment in its support. This country is in the same predicament in\nwhich France was previous to the famous Mississippi scheme, projected\nby Mr. Law. Its paper money, like ours, had dwindled to nothing; and no\nefforts of the Government could revive it, because the people had lost\nall confidence in its ability. Mr. Law, who had much more penetration\nthan integrity, readily perceived, that no plan could succeed which\ndid not unite the interest and credit of rich individuals with those\nof the State; and upon this, he framed the idea of his project, which,\nso far, agreed in principle with the Bank of England. The foundation\nwas good, but the superstructure too vast. The proprietors aimed at\nunlimited wealth, and the Government itself expected too much; which\nwas the cause of the ultimate miscarriage of the scheme, and of all the\nmischiefs that befel the kingdom in consequence.\n\nIt will be our wisdom to select what is good in this plan, and in any\nothers that have gone before us; avoiding their defects and excesses.\nSomething on a similar principle in America, will alone accomplish the\nrestoration of paper credit, and establish a permanent fund for the\nfuture exigencies of Government.\n\nArticle I. The plan I would propose, is that of an American Bank,\ninstituted by authority of Congress for ten years, under the\ndenomination of The Bank of the United States. II. A foreign loan\nmakes a necessary part of the plan; but this I am persuaded we can\nobtain, if we pursue the proper measures. I shall suppose it to amount\nto two millions of pounds sterling. This loan to be thrown into the\nBank as a part of its stock.\n\nIII. A subscription to be opened for two hundred millions of dollars;\nand the subscribers erected into a Company, to be called The\nCompany of the Bank of the United States.\n\nIV. The Government to guarantee this subscription money to the\nproprietors, at the rate of one for twenty; that is, to engage, at the\ndissolution of the Bank, to make good to them the sum of ten millions\nof dollars, in lieu of the two hundred millions subscribed, payable in\nSpanish milled dollars, or a currency bona fide equivalent to them.\n\nV. The taxes raised in money annually, to be thrown into stock.[8]\n\nVI. All the remaining paper to be called in (at the option of the\npossessor), and bank notes issued in lieu of them, for so much\nsterling, payable to the bearer in three months from the date, at two\nper cent. per annum interest. A pound sterling to be estimated at\ntwo hundred and sixty-six and two-thirds of the present dollars.[9]\nThe interest to be punctually paid in specie at the end of the three\nmonths; when it shall be at the choice of the possessor to have the\nbank notes renewed, or to receive the sum deposited, in the old paper.\n\nVII. All the money issued from the Bank, to be of the same\ndenomination, and on the same terms.[10] VIII. The Bank to furnish\nCongress with an annual loan of two millions sterling, if they have\noccasion for it, at four per cent. interest.\n\nIX. The whole, or such part of the stock as is judged necessary, to be\nemployed in commerce, in the manner, and on the terms, which shall be\nagreed upon, from time to time, between the Company, and a Board of\nTrade to be appointed by Congress.\n\nX. The Bank to issue occasionally, by permission of Congress, such\nsums as may be thought safe and expedient, in private loans, on good\nsecurities, at six per cent. interest.\n\nXI. The Government to share half the whole stock and profits of the\nBank.\n\nXII. The Bank to be managed by the trustees of the Company, under the\ninspection of the Board of Trade,[11] who may have recourse to the\nCompany books whenever they think proper, to examine the state of its\naffairs. The same is done in England, and in other countries where\nBanks are established, and is a privilege which the Government has a\nright to demand for its own security. It is the more necessary in this\ncase, from the commercial nature of the Bank.\n\nTo give an idea of the advantages\n\n [Here a part of the manuscript is missing.]\n\nwhich, having all the operation of money, and of a more advantageous\nkind than that which the lenders have parted with, will have all the\nefficacy of a payment. It is for this reason they are made to bear\ninterest: and there can be no doubt, that every man will prefer a\nspecies of money which answers all the purposes of a currency, and\neven, when lying idle, brings in a profit to the possessor. The same\nconsideration will prevent the lenders recalling the old paper, at the\nquarterly payments; because they hold a more valuable property instead\nof it. The interest is to be paid in specie, as a further temptation,\nfor which a small sum will suffice. The denomination of the money is\naltered; because it will produce a useful illusion. Mankind are much\nled by sounds and appearances; and the currency having changed its\nname, will seem to have changed its nature.\n\nThe Bank will advance bills to the amount of two millions of pounds\nsterling to Congress; and, in addition to its stock, will now have a\ndebt due it of this sum, which is to be considered as so much gained.\n\n [Here a part of the manuscript is missing.]\n\n Brought over,                                              7,075,000\n To be deducted,\n Drawn out of circulation, by the sale\n   of goods imported,                            4,000,000\n By governmental taxes, supposed to be,          1,000,000--5,000,000\n                                                            ---------\n Remaining in circulation the fourth year,                 Â£2,075,000\n\nThis will be less than the preceding, which is occasioned by the\nmillion supposed to be drawn in by taxes.\n\nThe national debt, on this plan, will stand thus, at the end of three\nyears:\n\n Foreign loan,                                 2,000,000\n Domestic loan, at two millions per annum,     6,000,000\n Interest, at four per cent.,                    320,000\n                                               ---------\n                                               8,320,000\n Half the value of the Bank,                   7,900,000\n                                               ---------\n Balance against the United States,             Â£420,000\n\nWe may, therefore, by means of this establishment, carry on the war\nthree years, and only incur a debt of four hundred and twenty thousand\npounds over and above the guarantee of the subscription money; which,\nhowever, is not to be paid till the end of ten years.\n\nI have said, in one place, that abstract calculations, in questions\nof finance, are not to be relied on: and as the complex operations of\ntrade are involved in the present plan, I am, myself, diffident of\nthose flattering results which it presents at every step. I am aware\nhow apt the imagination is to be heated in projects of this nature,\nand to overlook the fallacies which often lurk in first principles.\nBut when I consider, on the other hand, that the scheme stands on the\nfirm footing of public and private faith; that it links the interest of\nthe State in an intimate connection with those of the rich individuals\nbelonging to it; that it turns the wealth and influence of both into a\ncommercial channel, for mutual benefit, which must afford advantages\nnot to be estimated; that there is a defect of circulating medium,\nwhich this plan supplies, by a sort of creative power; converting what\nis so produced into a real and efficacious instrument of trade; I\nsay, when I consider these things, and many more that might be added,\nI cannot forbear feeling a degree of confidence in the plan; and, at\nleast, hoping that it is capable of being improved into something that\nwill give relief to our finances.\n\nI do not believe, that the advantages will be so great in fact, as\nthey seem to be in speculation. They will be limited by the means of\ncommerce which the States produce; and these may not be so extensive\nin the beginning as the plan supposes. Beside this, the profits of\nthe commerce will not be so large, in proportion, after the first or\nsecond year, as during those years: neither will it be possible to\nincrease the paper credit in the same degree. But the Bank of England\nis a striking example, how far this may be carried, when supported by\npublic authority and private influence. On the other hand, a variety of\nsecondary expedients may be invented, to enlarge the advantages of the\nbank. The whole system of annuities, as practised in England, may be\ningrafted upon it, with such differences as are proper to accommodate\nit to our circumstances. The European loan may also be converted into\na European Bank, the interests of which, being interwoven with the\nAmerican Bank, may engage rich individuals there in promoting and\nextending the plan.\n\nVery beneficial contracts may be made between Government and the\nCompany, for supplying the army, by which money may be saved to the\npublic, the army better furnished, and the profits of the bank extended.\n\nI have confined the Bank to the space of ten years; because this will\nbe long enough to judge of its advantages and disadvantages: and the\nlatter may be rectified by giving it a new form. I do not suppose it\nwill ever be discontinued; because it seems to be founded on principles\nthat must always operate well, and make it the interest, both of\nGovernment and the Company, to uphold it. But I suppose the plan\ncapable of improvement, which experience will suggest.\n\nI give one half of the whole property of the Bank to the United States;\nbecause it is not only just, but desirable to both parties. The United\nStates contribute a great part of the stock; their authority is\nessential to the existence of the Bank; their credit is pledged for\nits support. The plan would ultimately fail, if the terms were too\nfavorable to the Company, and too hard upon Government. It might be\nencumbered with a debt which it could never pay, and be obliged to take\nrefuge in a bankruptcy. The share which the State has in the profits,\nwill induce it to grant more ample privileges, without which the trade\nof the Company might often be under restrictions injurious to its\nsuccess.\n\nIt is not, perhaps, absolutely necessary that the sum subscribed\nshould be so considerable as I have stated it, though the larger the\nbetter. It is only necessary it should be considerable enough to engage\na sufficient number of the principal moneyed men in the scheme. But\nCongress must take care to proportion the advantages they give and\nreceive.\n\nIt may be objected, that this plan will be prejudicial to trade, by\nmaking the Government a party with a trading Company; which may be\na temptation to arrogate exclusive privileges, and thereby fetter\nthat spirit of enterprise and competition, on which the prosperity\nof commerce depends. But Congress may satisfy the jealousies on this\nhead, by a solemn resolution not to grant exclusive privileges, which\nalone can make the objection valid. Large trading Companies must be\nbeneficial to the commerce of a nation, when they are not invested with\nthese, because they furnish a capital with which the most extensive\nenterprises may be undertaken. There is no doubt the establishment\nproposed would be very serviceable at this juncture, merely in a\ncommercial view; for private adventurers are not a match for the\nnumerous obstacles resulting from the present posture of affairs.\nThe present plan is the product of some reading on the subjects of\ncommerce and finance, and of occasional reflections on our particular\nsituation: but a want of leisure has prevented its being examined in so\nmany lights, and digested so materially, as its importance requires.\nIf the outlines are thought worthy of attention, and any difficulties\noccur which demand explanation: or if the plan be approved, and the\nfurther thoughts of the writer are desired; a letter directed to James\nMontague, Esquire, lodged in the post-office at Morristown, will be a\nsafe channel of any communications you may think proper to make; and\nan immediate answer will be given. Though the writer has reasons which\nmake him unwilling to be known; if a personal conference with him\nshould be thought material, he will endeavor to comply.\n\nYou will consider this as a hasty production, and excuse the\nincorrectnesses with which it abounds.\n\n                                  I am, Sir, very respectfully,\n                                  Your most obedient and humble servant.\n\n\n[3] France owes a debt of near two hundred millions of pounds sterling;\nof which about twenty-eight millions is due to Governments and\nindividuals in the United Provinces.\n\nEngland owes a debt not much short: of which about thirty millions is\nlikewise due in the United Provinces.\n\nThe United Provinces, themselves, owe a debt of the generality,\nof fifty millions sterling besides the particular debts of each\nprovince. Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, all owe money to the\nUnited Provinces, notwithstanding the assistance of their mines. These\nGovernments, too, are patterns of economy. Sweden receives a constant\nsupply from France. The House of Austria is also to be included in the\ncatalogue. Spain is almost the only considerable European power to be\nexcepted; but this is to be attributed to that inexhaustible fund of\ntreasure which she possesses in the mines of South America.\n\nThe King of Prussia is one of those potentates the least in debt;\nnotwithstanding he has a long time made a figure in Europe, much\nabove what the comparative strength and resources of his kingdom\nentitled him to expect. This his superior genius has effected. By a\nwise administration, he maintains an army of one hundred and fifty\nthousand men, nearly equal to that of France, with one-third of its\npeople, and less than a third of its riches. This he does by judicious\narrangements; by a rigid economy; and by a species of commerce, which\nis carried on, on account of the State. There are several public\nmanufactories, from which the army is supplied; and by the help of\nwhich, the money paid out with one hand is taken in by the other.\n\n[4] This will appear, by recurring to our expenses in the commencement\nof the war, before the money was depreciated. In â75, which was only\nthree-fourths of a year, the emissions amounted to seven millions\nof dollars: in â76, to fourteen millions. The war did not begin, in\nearnest, till â76.\n\n[5] This is meant, without employing the assistance of a foreign loan,\nand of other expedients beside borrowing and taxing.\n\n[6] This will appear from the plan which will be proposed.\n\n[7] To form an idea of the effect of this plan, let it be supposed that\nthe goods imported amount to two millions of pounds sterling, and that\nthese sell at one hundred and fifty pounds in paper, for each pound\nsterling. The whole proceeds will be eight hundred millions of dollars:\nto these add two hundred millions, raised in taxes. There will then be\nin the hands of the public, one thousand millions of dollars; which, at\nsixty to one, gives sixteen millions six hundred and sixty-six thousand\nsix hundred and sixty-six and two-thirds of real dollars. Take the year\nâ76 for a standard, and suppose fourteen millions of dollars to be\nthe proper annual expense of the war, which is only two millions six\nhundred and sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six and two-thirds\nless than the whole amount of the goods and taxes. At this rate, the\nplan would do little more than defray the expenses of the war for one\nyear. But this calculation is not exactly true; because the money would\ncertainly appreciate, in some degree, by the reduction of its quantity:\nyet, as this reduction would not last, at least in the same extent, to\npreserve the appreciation; and as, in proportion to the appreciation,\nthe price of goods must fall, and bring less money in, it is difficult\nto say whether it would not ultimately come to the same thing.\n\n[8] The taxes are made to increase every year, for the three years;\nbecause the money in circulation increases, and, consequently, the\npeople can afford to pay more.\n\n[9] This is sixty paper dollars to one dollar of four shillings and\nsixpence sterling; which is the real value of the money. But if it is\napprehended that this may meet with opposition, let the valuation of\nthe bank notes be the same as the price of European Bills of Exchange.\nOther operations must be regulated accordingly.\n\n[10] The reason of this is, to preserve the idea of a Stock, and make\nit seem that the old paper is still in existence. But there is danger,\nnotwithstanding the reasons to the contrary, that there may be a run\nupon the bank, from particular causes, which may embarrass it. It is\nnot probable the old paper will be entirely, though nearly, called out\nof circulation: what remains, will appreciate: this may tempt those\nwho have bank notes, to demand payment on the terms of the original\ndeposit; without considering that, by bringing too great a quantity\nagain into circulation, it will again depreciate. The Bank may be\npushed to a very disagreeable extremity by this means. I do not know\nwhether it may not be advisable to confine the privilege of repayment\nto the lenders to the Bank, and make the bills bear interest, payable\nevery three months, without making the principal demandable. Much may\nbe said for and against. It is well worth consideration.\n\n[11] This board ought immediately to be established, at all events.\nThe Royal Council of Commerce, in France, and the subordinate Chambers\nin each province, form an excellent institution, and may, in many\nrespects, serve as a model. Congress have too long neglected to\norganize a good scheme of administration, and throw public business\ninto proper executive departments. For Commerce, I prefer a Board;\nbut for most other things, single men. We want a Minister of War, a\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, a Minister of Finance, and a Minister of\nMarine. There is always more decision, more dispatch, more secrecy,\nmore responsibility, where single men, than where bodies are concerned.\nBy a plan of this kind, we should blend the advantages of a Monarchy\nand of a Republic, in a happy and beneficial union. Men will only\ndevote their lives and attentions to the mastering a profession, on\nwhich they can build reputation and consequence which they do not share\nwith others.\n\nIf this plan should be approved, Congress ought immediately to appoint\na Minister of Finance, under whatsoever title they think proper,\nand charge him with its execution. He ought to be a man of ability,\nto comprehend it in all its consequences; and of eloquence, to make\nothers comprehend and relish it. He ought, beside, to have some general\nknowledge of the science. This man ought immediately to address himself\nto some of the most sensible moneyed men; and endeavor to convince them\nof the utility of the project. These must engage others, and so on,\ntill a sufficient number is engaged.\n\nThen Congress must establish the Bank, and set it agoing. I know of\nno man that has better pretensions than yourself; and I shall be very\nhappy to hear that Congress have said, âThou art the man.â\n\nI had like to have omitted one remark, which is, that the subscription\nmoney may be guaranteed, if necessary, at 10 to 1, as a greater\ninducement. This will only be twenty millions of dollars, or five\nmillions of pounds sterling; a cheap bargain to get rid of the\nperplexities we labor under, and convert the torrent of ideal money\ninto a moderate, but sufficient, stream, to supply the real wants of\nthe State. Congress, no doubt, would be able to borrow enough abroad to\npay this debt, if it should not find better means within itself. But I\nshall be much mistaken, if the proprietors will desire to be repaid,\nand not prefer continuing the loan to Government on reasonable terms.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                         Amboy, March 17, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI duly received your letter of the fourteenth, and shall not fail, in\nconjunction with General St. Clair, to attend to the military object of\nit. I am much obliged to your Excellency for the communication of your\nSouthern advices. The enemy are still in the dark about their fleet and\narmy gone that way, as we gather from the commissioners. They pretend\nto have little European news, though a vessel arrived two or three days\nsince from England, after ten weeks passage. We send you some late\nNew-York papers.\n\nThe commission has been several days at an end. The enemy, as was\nsupposed, had no idea of treating on national ground. We are now in\nprivate conversation, and so far not without hopes that the liberation\nof our prisoners will be effected on _admissible_ terms. Two or three\ndays more will probably put an end to the interview. General St. Clair\nand Colonel Carrington, beg their respects may be presented to your\nExcellency.\n\n                                   I have the honor to be,\n                                   Very respectfully and affectionately,\n                                   Your Excellencyâs most obât servant,\n                                   Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nDU PORTAIL TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                  Philadelphia, 21 March, 1780.\n\nMon Cher Colonel:\n\nQuoique je compte partir pour le camp dans peu de jours, la crainte\ndâÃªtre encore retenu plus longtemps que je ne voudrais, (comme je le\nsuis depuis un mois), me fait prendre le parti de vous Ã©crire quelque\nchose qui me semble dâune certaine importance qui me concerne. Hier\njâai appris quâil y a une quinzaine de jours hors de la nouvelle\nde lâarrivÃ©e des Anglais, un membre du CongrÃ¨s reprÃ©senta dans le\nCongrÃ¨s, quâil serait Ã  propos de mâenvoyer en Caroline avec la plus\ngrande hÃ¢te. Il fonda sa demande sur les choses avantageuses quâil\navait entendu dire de moi, etc., etc. Il voulait que le CongrÃ¨s\nme donnÃ¢t sur le champ des ordres, et que je partisse sans dÃ©lai.\nJâignore quel est le membre qui a fait cette proposition, seulement\nje conjecture que câest quelque delÃ©guÃ© dÃ©s Etats du sud. On lui a\nrÃ©pondu, que câÃ©tait au _Commandant-en-Chef_ quâil appartenait de faire\nune telle chose, que le CongrÃ¨s ne pouvait pas savoir sâil nâavait pas\nquelque raison de me retenir Ã  son ArmÃ©e, quoique dans la circonstance\nprÃ©sente, il parut effectivement que je serais plus utile au sud, en\nun mot _que lâattention avec laquelle le Commandant-en-Chef veillait\nau salut de lâEtat ne permettait pas de douter quâil nâemployÃ¢t tous\nles moyens qui Ã©taient en son pouvoir, et que les circonstances\npermettaient_.\n\nIl est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able, mon cher Colonel, dâÃªtre le sujet dâune aussi\nbelle phrase, mais je suis fÃ¢chÃ© que la chose ait tournÃ© ainsi;\nje suis aussi trÃ¨s fÃ¢chÃ© de nâavoir pas su tout cela dans le temps\npour vous le mander. Car il Ã©tait encore temps alors dâaller dans le\nsud; maintenant je ne sais plus que dÃ©sirer. Cependant hier lâon\nnous dÃ©bitait que des vaisseaux de transport servant de vaisseaux\nde guerre Ã©taient arrivÃ©s Ã  New-York pour prendre des Renforts; si\ncela Ã©tait si confirmÃ©, il nây aurait apparence que les Anglais ne se\nproposaient pas de commencer leurs opÃ©rations avant lâarrivÃ©e de ces\nRenforts, alors ce serait peut Ãªtre le cas dây aller. Je laisse tout\ncela Ã  faire Ã  votre prudence, et Ã  votre amitiÃ©, vous savez une partie\ndes raisons que jâai toujours eu et que jâai encore de ne point faire\nde demande Ã  ce sujet au GÃ©nÃ©ral Washington, mais vous savez aussi\ncombien je dÃ©sire dâaller en Caroline. Sâil y a quelque apparence que\nje puisse y arriver Ã  temps, je ne vois pas dâinconvÃ©nient Ã  ce que vous\nfaisiez usage auprÃ¨s du GÃ©neral de ce qui sâest passÃ© dans le CongrÃ¨s,\nparce que plusieurs membres de CongrÃ¨s lâont dÃ©jÃ  dit Ã  diffÃ©rentes\npersonnes.\n\n(Si vous voulez ensuite que je vous parle comme Ã  mon ami, je vous\ndirai que jâai eu lieu de voir que de mâenvoyer lÃ  bas, aurait fait un\nfort bon effet ici, surtout dans le commencement.)\n\nSupposez donc, que notre GÃ©neral jugeÃ¢t par des circonstances\nultÃ©rieures quâil peut encore Ãªtre temps de mây envoyer, comme il ne\nfaut pas perdre un moment, il serait bon que je ne fusse pas obligÃ© de\nretourner au camp. Pour cela il faudrait mâenvoyer avec les ordres,\ntoutes les lettres nÃ©cessaires pour le GÃ©neral Lincoln et autres. Vous\nsavez, mon cher Colonel, ce que je dÃ©sire Ã  cet Ã©gard. Si je vais lÃ -bas,\nil faut que mon arrivÃ©e soit comme un de ces accidents au thÃ©Ã¢tre\nqui rÃ©veille les spectateurs, et redonne de lâactivitÃ© et de la chaleur\nÃ  la piÃ¨ce, vous mâentendez.\n\nJe crois que dans ce cas le GÃ©nÃ©ral doit Ã©crire au CongrÃ¨s, outre les\nraisons quâil a de mâenvoyer pour le prier de me faire donner tous les\nmoyens nÃ©cessaires pour faire diligence.\n\nEnfin, prenez bien garde Ã  ceci, mon cher Colonel, si vous mâenvoyez\ndes ordres, sitÃ´t que cela sera dÃ©cidÃ©, envoyez chercher Monsieur\nde lâEstaing, mon Aide-de-Camp, et dites lui sâil vous plaÃ®t de faire\npartir sur le champ ma malle et la sienne sur un waggon du quartier\nmaÃ®tre, sâil y en a qui partant sur le champ, sinon sur mon propre\nwaggon: quâil nâoublie pas surtout mes papiers. Il peut ensuite venir\naprÃ¨s lui mÃªme et mâapporter les lettres du GÃ©nÃ©ral. Il faut quâil\nfasse diligence; je ne puis partir sans diffÃ©rentes choses qui sont\ndans ma malle; quâil se munisse lui mÃªme de ce quâil lui faut. Mon\nadresse ici est: Mrs. Sword in Logan Alley, Second-street.\n\nJe ne partirai point dâici avant lundi prochain afin dâattendre votre\nrÃ©ponse.\n\n                            Jâai lâhonneur dâÃªtre, mon cher Colonel,\n                            Avec le plus parfait attachment,\n                            Votre trÃ¨s humble et trÃ¨s obÃ©issant servant,\n                            Du Portail.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   Philadelphia, April 8, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n* * * * * * You have been mentioned in private conversation\nto go as Secretary to the Embassy at the Court of Versailles;\nthere is but one obstacle which prevents me from making up my\nmind on the subject; that you will know when I have the pleasure\nof seeing you. In the mean time revolve the matter in yours.\n\nThe pride, the folly, and perhaps, too, the wickedness of some on a\ncertain floor, combine to frustrate every intention to promote the\npublic weal, and relieve my amiable Chief from his well-grounded\nanxiety; the few that feel for him, and are alarmed at the critical\nstate of our public affairs, in every department, within as well as\nwithout, have not been able to carry a measure which they believed\nwould have had salutary consequences. They have now proposed that a\nCommittee should repair to head quarters, invested conjointly with\nthe General, with a kind of dictatorial power, in order to afford\nsatisfaction to the army, and to arrange the great departments\nthereof. Livingston, Elsworth, and Matthews, are appointed to prepare\nInstructions. Some good may result, if gentlemen who love the General,\nare not jealous of the army, and of a generous turn are sent; but\nshould General Sherman be at the head of the Triumviri, the General\nwill be tormented with a thousand little propositions which Roger has\nthrown together, and which he entitles a System. I shall not be sent on\nthis business, âbecause, it would not be proper to send a person who,\nas he has been in the army, will probably have a bias in its favor.â\nThis reasoning is conclusive.\n\nBeware of communications to this quarter, which you would not wish the\nworld to know; this hint will prevent you from writing but by a safe\nhand.\n\nIt is amusing to observe the effect Sir Harry Clintonâs private No.\n15 has. The Southernites have their spirits much raised by it. The\nNortherns look big, and the enemyâs distress is owing to their virtue\nand exertions. They wish for the 12,000 Hessians to have the pleasure\nof devouring them. The war is to be at an end next winter, and as they\nwish to conclude handsomely, they will insist that their constituents\ncomplete their quotas without delay, and furnish aids of money, &c. En\nveritÃ© there are only two or three of the club who believe the letter\nspurious, but two who are decidedly of that opinion.\n\nMy best wishes to all at head quarters.\n\n                                        I am, dear Sir, sincerely yours,\n                                        Ph. Schuyler.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\n\n\n                                                           May 10, 1780.\n\nDear Baron:\n\nGeneral Knox, in conversation, has observed to the General, that\ninstead of sending to Philadelphia for the fifteen hundred arms\nmentioned in your letter of the sixth, and sending those here to that\nplace to be fitted, it would be a great saving of expense, in the\narticle of transportation, to have the bayonets and accoutrements\nbrought on without the arms, and fitted to those now here; which can\neasily be done at the Park. The question is, if the arms here have no\nother defect than want of bayonets. The General will be glad to know\nwhat you think of General Knoxâs proposal. It seems to him eligible,\nunless there are reasons he is not acquainted with.\n\nIf there are any other articles you wish to have sent for (the General\nthinks you mentioned something of the kind to him), he will be glad to\nknow what they are.\n\nWe have heard from the Marquis. He will be here at dinner. Will you\ndine with us also? The General requests it.\n\n                                     I have the honor to be, dear Baron,\n                                     Your very humble servant,\n                                     Alex. Hamilton, A. D. C.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\n\n\n                                                           May 14, 1780.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nThis will be handed you by the Marquis, who brings us very important\nintelligence. The General communicates the substance of it in a private\nletter to you, and proposes a measure which all deem essential. For\nGodâs sake, my dear sir, engage Congress to adopt it, and come to a\nspeedy decision. We have not a moment to lose. Were we to improve every\ninstant of the interval, we should have too little time for what we\nhave to do. The expected succor may arrive in the beginning of June,\nin all probability it will not be later than the middle. In the last\ncase we have not a month to make our preparations in, and in this short\nperiod we must collect men, form magazines, and do a thousand things of\nas much difficulty as importance. The propriety of the measure proposed\nis so obvious, that an hour ought to decide it, and if any new members\nare to come, they ought to set out instantly with all expedition for\nhead quarters. Allow me, my dear sir, to give you a hint. The General\nwill often be glad to consult the Committee on particular points, but\nit will be inexpedient that he should be obliged to do it oftener than\nhe thinks proper, or any peculiar case may require. Their powers should\nbe formed accordingly. It is the essence of many military operations,\nthat they should be trusted to as few as possible.\n\nThe Marquis has a title to all the love of all America; but you know he\nhas a thousand little whims to satisfy; one of these he _will have_ me\nto write to some friend in Congress about. He is desirous of having the\nCaptain of the frigate in which he came complimented; and gives several\npretty instances of his punctuality and disinterestedness. He wishes\nCongress to pass some resolutions of thanks, and to recommend him to\ntheir Minister in France, to be recommended to the French Court. The\nfirst of these is practicable. The last I think might have an officious\nappearance. The _essential_ services the Marquis has rendered America\nin France, give him a claim for all that can be done with propriety;\nbut Congress must not commit themselves.\n\nAgain, my dear sir, I must entreat you to use the spur on the present\noccasion. The fate of America is perhaps suspended on the issue; if we\nare found unprepared, it must disgrace us in the eyes of all Europe,\nbesides defeating the good intentions of our allies, and losing the\nhappiest opportunity we ever have had to save ourselves. Adieu, my dear\nSir.\n\nBelieve me to be, with the truest respect and affection,\n\n                                               Your most obedât servant,\n                                               A. Hamilton.\n\n  Hon. James Duane, Philadelphia.\n  Honored by Marquis De Lafayette.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\n\n\n                                                           June 7, 1780.\n\nDear Baron:\n\nI am commanded by the General to inform you, that the enemy are out in\nconsiderable force; and, by the last advice, were advancing this way.\nWe are going to meet them. The General is just set out for Chatham, and\nwill be happy to meet you there.\n\n                                          Yours, respectfully,\n                                          A.

Those in view I calculate at about three\nthousand: there may be, and probably enough are, others out of sight.\nThey have sent all their horse to the other side, except about fifty\nor sixty. Their baggage, it is agreed on all hands, has also been sent\nacross, and their wounded. It is not ascertained that any of their\ninfantry have passed to the other side. There are four or five hundred\non the opposite point; but it is uncertain whether they are those who\nwent from this side, or those who were on Staten Island. I rather\nsuppose the former.\n\nDifferent conjectures may be made. The present movement may be\ncalculated to draw us down and betray us into an action. They may have\ndesisted from their intention of passing till night, for fear of our\nfalling upon their rear. I believe this is the case: for as they have\nbut few boats, it would certainly be a delicate manÅuvre to cross in\nour face. We are taking measures to watch their motions to-night, as\nclosely as possible. An incessant but _very light_ skirmishing. Very\nfew boats, not more than enough to carry three or four hundred men at a\ntime. It is likely more will come down this evening.\n\n                                I have the honor to be,\n                                Your Excellencyâs most obedient servant,\n                                Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO CHEVALIER DE TERNAY.\n\n\n                                Au Cap Henry, le 13 Juin, 1780.\n\nMonsieur le Chevalier:\n\nJe suis envoyÃ© par le GÃ©nÃ©ral Washington au Cap Henry pour y attendre\nvotre escadre et vous remettre ainsi quâÃ  Monsieur le Comte de\nRochambau, les dÃ©pÃªches de Monsieur le Marquis de La Fayette--ces\ndÃ©pÃªches, Monsieur le Chevalier, contiennent le plan dâopÃ©rations que\nle GÃ©nÃ©ral Washington a lâhonneur de vous proposer, la situation des\nennemies et la nÃ´tre relativement aux forces respectives des deux\nparties, aux points occupÃ©s, aux moyens de subsistance et cetÃ©ra; tous\nles changements qui pouvraient survenir sur ces objets doivent mâÃªtre\ncommuniquÃ©s, afin quâÃ  votre arrivÃ©e vous puissiez avoir sous les yeux\nle plus de donnÃ©es possibles. Les mÃªmes dÃ©tails vous attendent Ã  Rhode\nIsland, et si vous ne devez les reÃ§evoir quâaprÃ¨s Ãªtre arrivÃ©, il est\npresque indiffÃ©rent, Monsieur le Chevalier, que votre escadre atterisse\nÃ  Rhode Island ou au Cap Henry; mais il y a des circonstances qui, si\nelles vous Ã©taient connues, tendraient peut Ãªtre Ã  vous dÃ©terminer\nplutÃ´t pour lâun de ces points que pour lâautre, ou mÃªme pour un\ntroisiÃ¨me point que vos instructions nâont pu prÃ©voir. Câest pour vous\nrendre compte de ces circonstances que je saisis lâoccasion du fier\nRodrique; heureux si, dans une conjoncture oÃ¹ les moments sont dâune si\ngrande importance, cette lettre peut anticiper de quelques jours vos\ndispositions.\n\n1Âº. Par le plan proposÃ© Ã  vous, Monsieur le Chevalier, et Ã  Monsieur\nle Comte de Rochambau, les efforts combinÃ©s de lâarmÃ©e FranÃ§aise et\nAmericaine doivent se porter sur New-York, et vous Ãªtes instamment priÃ©\nde vous rendre immÃ©diatement Ã  Sandy Hook.\n\n2Âº. Suivant les informations qui mâont Ã©tÃ© rÃ©cemment fournies par\nle Gouverneur de la Virginie, la ville de Charlestown est prise; les\nennemis embarquent une partie des troupes qui en ont fait la ConquÃªte;\net dâaprÃ¨s la certitude oÃ¹ nous sommes que la destination de votre\nescadre leur est connue, il semble que cet embarquement pourrait bien\navoir pour objet de renforcer la garnison de New-York.\n\n3Âº. La somme de leurs forces navales sur ce continent se borne Ã  trois\nvaisseaux de ligne, un de 50 canons, deux de 44, et quelques frÃ©gates Ã \nCharlestown; un vaisseau de 74 et quelques frÃ©gates, sortis de New-York\ndepuis trois semaines et dont nous ignorons la destination.\n\nAinsi, Monsieur le Chevalier, la premiÃ¨re de ces considÃ©rations vous\ninvite Ã  Sandy Hook; la seconde rÃ©clame votre atterrage sur un point\ndâoÃ¹ vous puissiez Ãªtre en mesure dâintercepter les Secours destinÃ©s\npour New-York, et la troisiÃ¨me vous offre un terme de comparaison entre\nla plus grande force qui puisse escorter ces secours, et celle avec\nlaquelle vous pouvez les attaquer. Il est encore Ã  observer quâexceptÃ©\nles trois vaisseaux de ligne, tous les autres (Ã  Charlestown) sont dans\nle port, et que les plus gros nâen peuvent sortir, quâaprÃ¨s avoir Ã©tÃ©\nallÃ©gÃ©s, et avec la concurrence dâune haute marÃ©e et dâun vent propice.\n\nTelles sont, Monsieur le Chevalier, les choses dont ma mission a pour\nobjet de vous rendre compte, et comme il est de toute importance que\nces informations vous parviennent le plus tÃ´t possible, jâai cru ne pas\ndevoir nÃ©gliger la probabilitÃ©, qui sâoffre de les faire devancer votre\narrivÃ©e.\n\nEn supposant, Monsieur le Chevalier, que le fier Rodrique vous\nrencontre et que vous jugiez Ã  propos de vous rendre en droiture\nÃ  Sandy Hook, il est un moyen de faire que les dÃ©pÃ¢ches qui vous\nattendent Ã  Rhode Island et du Cap Henry vous parviennent aussi\npromptement qui si vous aviez atterri Ã  lâun de ces deux points: ce\nserait de dÃ©pÃªcher, vers lâun ou lâautre, lâun de vos plus lÃ©gers\nvaisseaux qui recevrait Ã  son bord lâofficier chargÃ© de ces dÃ©pÃªches,\net vous irait rejoindre vers Sandy Hook, oÃ¹ vraisemblablement il se\nrendrait aussitÃ´t que votre flotte, ou du moins beaucoup plus tÃ´t que\nles rÃ©ponses de GÃ©nÃ©ral Washington ou de Monsieur le Marquis de La\nFayette, aux lettres qui leur annonceraient votre arrivÃ©e.\n\nSi le Cap Henry Ã©tait le point choisi, jâoserais vous prier, Monsieur\nle Chevalier, afin dâÃ©viter tous dÃ©lais, dâordonner quâÃ  la vue, du\nsignal que vous savez, le vaisseau y rÃ©ponde par un signal contraire,\nje veux dire en avertissant la position des pavillons; quâil envoie\nsa chaloupe Ã  terre avec un officier muni des mots de reconnaissance;\nque cet officier me donne la premiÃ¨re partie de ces mots et reÃ§oive\nde moi la seconde. Par lÃ  je crois, Monsieur le Chevalier, que toute\npossibilitÃ© de surprise est sauvÃ©e, de part et dâautre, sans quâil y\nait un seul instant de perdre par le CÃ©rÃ©monial de la reconnaissance.\n\n                                                   Je suis, &c. &c. &c.\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\nA Monsieur le Chevalier de Ternay.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\n\n\n                                       Whippany, June 25, 1780.\n\nDear Baron:\n\nThe enemy, the day before yesterday, made a forward movement to\nSpringfield, which they burnt, and retired to Elizabethtown Point. The\nsame evening they crossed over to Staten Island; and there are a great\nmany concurring circumstances which make it probable we shall next\nhear of them on the North River. As you are at West Point, the General\nwishes you to remain there until the present appearances come to some\nresult. He has confidence in your judgment, and wishes you to give your\nadvice and assistance to the commanding officer. As you have no command\nin the post, you can only do this in a private friendly way: but I dare\nsay General Howe will be happy to consult you. You will consider this\nas a private letter, in which I rather convey you the Generalâs wishes\nthan his commands.\n\nAll the army is in march toward you, and will be at Pompton this\nevening.\n\n                                   I have the honor to be,\n                                   Very respectfully and affectionately,\n                                   Your humble servant,\n                                   Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\n\n\n                          Head-Quarters, Ramapo, June 30, 1780.\n\nAgreeably to your request, my dear Baron, I communicated your project\nto the General. Happily the inactivity of the enemy has given us time\nto make dispositions which render the calling out of the militia\nunnecessary; and the whole has been accordingly countermanded.\n\nThe General requests that when you have completed the object of your\nerrand in your department, and put things in train, you will rejoin the\narmy.\n\nI wrote you a line from Whippany, of which you made no mention.\n\n                                          I have the honor to be, yours,\n                                          A. H.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\n\n\n                                  Head-Quarters, July 23, 1780.\n\nI have received, my dear Baron, your two letters of the sixteenth and\neighteenth. On the formation of the Light Infantry, the General has\nalready written to you. I presume it will be, ultimately, nearly as you\nhave proposed.\n\nSmith set out, some days since, to join you. Bradford, I am told, is\nundecided about entering into the office. Col. Scammel has promised\nto bring him to me; and if he accepts, we will forward him. I believe\nPrescott will be appointed in the Light Infantry. _Entre nous_, âtis\nnot easy to find good Majors for this corps in the Massachusetts Line;\nand as it will act a good deal with the French troops, we wish it (for\nthis additional reason) to be well officered. Prescott will answer\nthe purpose: but he is not yet to know that he is in contemplation.\nWe shall not long continue in our present position. The distinctions\nof departments are an old story, which now do not exist except with\nrespect to South Carolina. You are with a detachment of the main army.\n\nI dare say all you are doing will be found right. I shall join my\n_beau-pere_ to save you from the cord. The arrangement for your\ndepartment was unfortunately sent to Congress soon after you went\nfrom here; with the most pressing instances to determine upon it\nwithout delay. We have heard nothing of it since. We have repeated our\n_prayers_ and _exhortations_. If we get no answer in three or four\ndays, we must determine for ourselves.\n\nMajor Francis is returned from Philadelphia; but I have not seen him\nsince the arrival of your letters. I will move the inquiry you wish,\nwhen I see him. Can you do any thing for him in your department?\n\nA severe stroke upon us, is, that our arms, expected from France, are\nnot arrived. I do not know how we shall be able to arm our recruits.\n\nGraves sailed from the Hook the nineteenth. We had been playing off and\non two days.\n\nAdieu, my dear Baron, and believe me always, with the most respectful\nattachment,\n\n                                                    Your humble servant,\n                                                    A. H.\n\n\n\n\nBAUMAN TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   West Point, August 13, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI cannot help laying before you a few of my thoughts, which lately\nhave engrossed my whole attention, on the review of our changeable\ngovernment at West Point. However, I hope you will make no other use\nof them but such as may be of advantage; and whatever may be improper,\nor improperly stated, impute to my inability only: and there you\nwill please to let it rest, and take in good part what I shall say,\nas it proceeds from a zeal of affection to you, and from a regard to\nthe cause I am engaged in. On this consideration you will excuse me,\nif any where I should seem to exceed those bounds which custom has\nprescribed to subalterns, when they treat of any thing, or adopt modes,\nto their superiors.\n\nA continual change of commanding officers, or commandants, is, in my\nhumble opinion, injurious to this post, and hurtful to the military\nduty, so absolutely requisite to be performed, and preserved in a\ngarrison. As there is no nation at war which pursues the like mode\nexcepting us; I am therefore induced, not only from this consideration,\nbut from weighty experience during my station at this post, to offer\nan opinion of its impropriety, and bad consequences. The visible ill\nit creates; the damage to innumerable things; the irregularity it\ncontinually causes; and lastly, the total loss of the many thousands\nwhich have been, and daily are, expended on this national fabric, which\ninevitably must fall to pieces, unless an officer is fixed to this\npost (and who ought to be a competent judge of fortifications, and a\nmilitary man), are matters which, I think, demand consideration.\n\nA Town-Major, and a good Barrack-Master, are as necessary here, as\nthe necessaries of life are. The former to regulate the duty and to\nkeep up discipline in this jurisdiction: the latter to take care of\nthe buildings, which must otherwise be destroyed. The next thing which\nfalls to our attention, is the public provision, which has been, and\ndaily is, exposed here to be lost, to be stolen, and to be damaged, for\nwant of sufficient shelter and proper repositories. The troops have\nsuffered, and still suffer, from these and other causes. They have\nbeen cheated in weights, in measure, and in their scanty allowance of\nfatigue rum; which I can attest, by being appointed, after my having\nrepresented the matter to General MâDougall, to inspect into some of\nthose abuses. Notwithstanding the many thousands of boards which came\nhere, there are not sufficient for barracks, bunks, etc. For as fast\nas one thing is built up, another is torn down again. There is not,\nin all this garrison, a proper guard-house for the conveniency of\nsoldiers, nor for the security of the criminals. No powder magazine,\nnor a store for the reception and reserve of the implements of war. In\nshort, the whole appears, at present, under the care of ungovernable\nand undisciplined militia, like a wild Tartarâs camp, instead of that\nshining fortification all America thinks not only an insurmountable\nbarrier against the incursion of its enemy, but likewise an easy\ndefence in case of an unforeseen disaster of its army.\n\nHowever, to return to my subject. The importance of those heads already\nmentioned, and their connection with those preceding, will, I hope,\nobtain your pardon for the digression into which they have led me; and\nto your discretion I shall leave what I state.\n\nIn a letter I wrote to General Knox some time last winter, among many\nthings I had to say concerning the ordnance and myself, I made this\nremark, to wit: âThat relieving of an officer from a garrison, is not\nlike a relief in the field: for an officer who knows himself to be\nrelieved, will leave many things undone for the next to do; which I\nhave seen, heard, and experienced. Beside, after once every thing is to\nrights, the men then ought to desist from labor, and exercise the guns.\nBut new commanding officers have chiefly new systems of defence, which\nadd labor to labor, and nothing will be formed systematically.â\n\nI have already stated these and more things minutely to the general\nofficers here, who all agreed in their validity and propriety. But\nthey, being all liable to immediate removal, there cannot be any thing\nformed into a permanent and regular system. Moreover, I have been\ninformed, that owing to the mismanagement of their predecessors, they\nwere obliged, after they had taken the command, to hunt for materials\nin order to build their own systems; and to issue orders upon orders,\nto acquaint themselves with those persons who have, as it were, in\nkeeping, the several branches which flow into this department.\n\nAnd let me once more, in confidence, assure you, that I suffer\nincessant pain from the sad state this garrison is in. To rectify\ndefects, my dear sir, when roused to arms, can never be attainable.\nTherefore let me beg you to assist in adopting some plan which may be\nsoldierly, for the good of the service: which, however, can be done\nin no other manner, but such as I have hinted to you. For let General\nArnold have all the sagacity imaginable, it will take him some time\nto get himself well acquainted with the position and defence of this\npost; especially as there is not one single Continental officer left\nhere who can in any way assist him. Every thing seems new here; and the\nvery engineer is transferred from hence, on whom he, in some measure,\ncould have depended for information, with regard to the weakest and\nstrongest parts of this fortress. And I have not yet told you the one\nhundredth part of what I have to say upon some of these subjects; but I\nshall finish with prognosticating, that should ever capriciousness hold\nsway here, it may prove fatal to this post.\n\n                                            I am, with due respect, Sir,\n                                            Your most humble servant,\n                                            S. Bauman,\n                                            Major of Artillery.\n\n\n\n\nDE MARBOIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   Philadelphia, 21 Aout, 1780.\n\nJe viens de recevoir mon cher Colonel votre lettre du 17 de ce mois.\nVous mây parlez de mes FrÃ¨res comme si vous Ã©tiez sÃ»r quâils sont en\neffet prisonniers. Avez-vous sur cet article plus de connaissance que\nje nâen ai, on mâavez-vous dÃ©jÃ  Ã©crit Ã  ce sujet quelque lettre qui ne\nme serait point parvenue. Je vais Ã©crire Ã  M. de Ternay Ã  ce sujet,\nmais en attendant je vous prie de vouloir bien me communiquer tous les\nÃ©claircissements que vous aurez pu vous procurer, et dâÃªtre persuadÃ©\nque rien ne me touche plus que de leur procurer de soulagement sâils\nsont en effet entre les mains de lâennemi.\n\nSi vous avez quelques nouvelles derniÃ¨res touchant lâembarcation que\nM. le GÃ©nÃ©ral Clinton prÃ©pare, je vous prie de vouloir bien mâen\ninstruire, cet article Ã©tant de la plus grande importance pour nous. Je\nvous embrasse de tout mon cÅur.\n\n                                                    De Marbois.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                 Hillsborough, August 30, 1780.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nAbout the twenty-third instant, I wrote my friend Harrison from\nSalisbury, giving him a very hasty particular account of the defeat\nof General Gatesâs army at Suttonâs, near Campden, the sixteenth\ninstant. We were truly unfortunate, and completely routed. The infamous\ncowardice of the militia of Virginia and North Carolina, gave the enemy\nevery advantage over our few regular troops, whose firm opposition\nand gallant behavior have gained them the applause, as well of our\nsuccessful foes, as of our runaway friends. If I mentioned to Col.\nHarrison the loss of two howitzers, I was mistaken. We had eight\npieces of light artillery, with six ammunition wagons, which, with the\ngreatest part of our baggage, were lost.\n\nOur retreat was the most mortifying that could have happened. Those who\nescaped the dangers of the field, knew not where to find protection:\nthe wounded found no relief from the inhabitants, who were immediately\nin arms against us; and many of our fugitive officers and men were\ndisarmed by those faithless villains, who had flattered us with\npromises of joining us against the enemy. The tories are now assembling\nin different parts of the country; and there is actually a sort of\npartisan war waged between them and the whigs of this country.\n\nThe greatest part of our baggage was plundered by those who first left\nthe field. The enemy took a part; and much of what escaped them, has\nbeen pillaged by the inhabitants on the retreat. The wagon horses have\nbeen stolen, and frequently taken from the drivers; and some of those\ndesperate rascals have been daring enough to fire upon parties of our\nregular troops many miles from the place of action.\n\nGeneral Gates used the utmost expedition in getting from the lost field\nto this place. As this step is unaccountable to me, you must expect to\nknow the reason another time, and from better authority. An unfortunate\nGeneral usually loses the confidence of his army; and this is much the\ncase with us at present. However, I suppose every thing necessary will\nbe done, in justification of the steps that have been taken, and then\nall will be understood. Beside my ignorance, there is another reason\nfor my silence on this subject. The General is extremely mortified at\nthe disappointment his hopes have met with; and I think it ungenerous\nto oppress dejected spirits by a premature censure.\n\nThe legislature of this State is now sitting at this place, and\ndevising means of defending the country. The General has exhibited\nestimates (he informs me) of the supplies wanting to carry on the\ncampaign, both to the legislature of this State, and to Virginia; and\nhopes they will be furnished. The officers of North Carolina talk\nconfidently of re-embodying a great number of militia. General Stephens\nhad collected about eight hundred of the Virginia militia at this place\nsince the action. But I am sorry to add, at least half that number have\ndeserted. The Maryland Division, including the Delaware regiment, will,\nI hope, muster six hundred when all are collected. Part are now here: a\nparty are with General Smallwood at Ellisâs Ferry, Adkin river; and a\nsmall party with Major Anderson, who General Smallwood left some time\nat Charlotte, to receive the fugitives as they arrived. But this is the\nplace of general rendezvous.\n\nFrom the best accounts I can get, Lord Cornwallis had with him, on\nthe day of battle, the seventy-first, sixty-third, thirty-third, and\ntwenty-third British regiments; a corps of Hessians, Tarltonâs legion,\nand some new levies, amounting to about three thousand men. Our numbers\nwere very little greater; and our force will not be imagined so great,\nby those who are informed of our long march in a barren country, with\nvery little other subsistence than a short allowance of fresh beef,\ngreen corn, apples, and peaches.\n\nAs soon as I recover from a relaxation of spirits, which is all my\npresent complaint, I will write you again, and inform you that we are\nresolved not to despair, but bear our fortunes like veterans in the\nSouth; while you, like heroes in the North, win and wear the laurels\nof the present campaign. Present my most respectful compliments to\nthe General, whom I love; to all my friends at head quarters and in\ncamp. Not a man among you have been generous enough to write a single\nsentence to\n\n                                        Your sincere friend and servant,\n                                        O. H. Williams.\n\nI mentioned the surprise of General Sumpterâs party, which happened the\nsixteenth instant, in my last.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO JAMES DUANE.\n\n\n                               Liberty Pole, September 8, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAgreeably to your request, and my promise, I sit down to give you my\nideas of the defects of our present system, and the changes necessary\nto save us from ruin. They may, perhaps, be the reveries of a\nprojector, rather than the sober views of a politician. You will judge\nof them, and make what use you please of them.\n\nThe fundamental defect is a want of power in Congress. It is hardly\nworth while to show in what this consists, as it seems to be\nuniversally acknowledged; or to point out how it has happened, as the\nonly question is how to remedy it. It may, however, be said, that it\nhas originated from three causes; an excess of the spirit of liberty,\nwhich has made the particular States show a jealousy of all power not\nin their own hands; and this jealousy has led them to exercise a right\nof judging in the last resort of the measures recommended by Congress,\nand of acting according to their own opinions of their propriety,\nor necessity; a diffidence, in Congress, of their own powers, by\nwhich they have been timid and indecisive in their resolutions:\nconstantly making concessions to the States, till they have scarcely\nleft themselves the shadow of power; a want of sufficient means at\ntheir disposal to answer the public exigencies, and of vigor to draw\nforth those means; which have occasioned them to depend on the\nStates individually, to fulfil their engagements with the army; the\nconsequence of which, has been to ruin their influence and credit with\nthe army, to establish its dependence on each State separately, rather\nthan _on them_, that is, rather than on the whole collectively.\n\nIt may be pleaded, that Congress had never any definite powers granted\nthem, and, of course, could exercise none, could do nothing more\nthan recommend. The manner in which Congress was appointed, would\nwarrant, and the public good required, that they should have considered\nthemselves as vested with full power _to preserve the republic from\nharm_. They have done many of the highest acts of sovereignty, which\nwere always cheerfully submitted to: The declaration of independence;\nthe declaration of war: the levying of an army; creating a navy;\nemitting money; making alliances with foreign powers; appointing a\ndictator, etc., etc. All these implications of a complete sovereignty\nwere never disputed, and ought to have been a standard for the whole\nconduct of administration. Undefined powers are discretionary powers,\nlimited only by the object for which they were given; in the present\ncase, the independence and freedom of America. The Confederation\nmade no difference; for as it has not been generally adopted, it had\nno operation. But from what I recollect of it, Congress have even\ndescended from the authority which the spirit of that act gives them;\nwhile the particular States have no further attended to it, than as it\nsuited their pretensions and convenience. It would take too much time\nto enter into particular instances, each of which separately might\nappear inconsiderable; but united, are of serious import. I only mean\nto remark, not to censure.\n\nBut the Confederation itself is defective, and requires to be altered.\nIt is neither fit for war nor peace. The idea of an uncontrollable\nsovereignty, in each State, over its internal police, will defeat\nthe other powers given to Congress, and make our union feeble and\nprecarious. There are instances without number, where Acts, necessary\nfor the general good, and which rise out of the powers given to\nCongress, must interfere with the internal police of the States;\nand there are as many instances in which the particular States, by\narrangements of internal police, can effectually, though indirectly,\ncounteract the arrangements of Congress. You have already had examples\nof this, for which I refer you to your own memory.\n\nThe Confederation gives the States, individually, too much influence in\nthe affairs of the army. They should have nothing to do with it. The\nentire formation and disposal of our military forces, ought to belong\nto Congress. It is an essential cement of the union: and it ought to\nbe the policy of Congress, to destroy all ideas of State attachments\nin the army, and make it look up wholly to them. For this purpose, all\nappointments, promotions, and provisions, whatsoever, ought to be made\nby them. It may be apprehended that this may be dangerous to liberty.\nBut nothing appears more evident to me, than that we run much greater\nrisk of having a weak and disunited federal government, than one which\nwill be able to usurp upon the rights of the people.\n\nAlready some of the lines of the army would obey their States in\nopposition to Congress, notwithstanding the pains we have taken to\npreserve the unity of the army. If any thing would hinder this, it\nwould be the personal influence of the General; a melancholy and\nmortifying consideration.\n\nThe forms of our State constitutions, must always give them great\nweight in our affairs, and will make it too difficult to bend them to\nthe pursuit of a common interest; too easy to oppose whatever they do\nnot like: and to form partial combinations subversive of the general\none. There is a wide difference between our situation, and that of an\nempire under one simple form of government, distributed into counties,\nprovinces, or districts, which have no legislatures, but merely\nmagistratical bodies, to execute the laws of a common sovereign. Here\nthe danger is, that the sovereign will have too much power, and oppress\nthe parts of which it is composed. In our case, that of an empire\ncomposed of confederated States; each with a government completely\norganized within itself, having all the means to draw its subjects to\na close dependence on itself; the danger is directly the reverse. It\nis, that the common sovereign will not have power sufficient to unite\nthe different members together, and direct the common forces to the\ninterest and happiness of the whole.\n\nThe leagues among the old Grecian republics are a proof of this. They\nwere continually at war with each other; and, for want of union, fell\na prey to their neighbors. They frequently held general councils; but\ntheir resolutions were no further observed, than as they suited the\ninterests and inclinations of all the parties; and, at length, they\nsunk entirely into contempt.\n\nThe Swiss Cantons are another proof of the doctrine. They have had\nwars with each other, which would have been fatal to them, had not\nthe different powers, in their neighborhood, been too jealous of one\nanother, and too equally matched, to suffer either to take advantage of\ntheir quarrels. That they have remained so long united at all, is to be\nattributed to their weakness, to their poverty, and to the causes just\nmentioned. These ties will not exist in America; a little time hence,\nsome of the States will be powerful empires; and we are so remote from\nother nations, that we shall have all the leisure and opportunity we\ncan wish, to cut each otherâs throats.\n\nThe Germanic corps might also be cited as an example in favor of the\nposition.\n\nThe United Provinces may be thought to be one against it. But the\nfamily of the Stadtholders, whose authority is interwoven with the\nwhole Government, has been a strong link of union between them.\nTheir physical necessities, and the habits founded upon them, have\ncontributed to it.\n\nEach province is too inconsiderable, by itself, to undertake any thing.\nAn analysis of their present constitutions, would show that they have\nmany ties which would not exist in ours; and that they are by no means\na proper model for us.\n\nOur own experience should satisfy us. We have felt the difficulty of\ndrawing out the resources of the country, and inducing the States to\ncombine in equal exertions for the common cause.\n\nThe ill success of our last attempt is striking. Some have done a\ngreat deal; others little, or scarcely any thing. The disputes about\nboundaries, etc., testify how flattering a prospect we have of future\ntranquillity, if we do not frame, in time, a confederacy capable\nof deciding the differences, and compelling the obedience of the\nrespective members.\n\nThe Confederation, too, gives the power of the purse too entirely\nto the State Legislatures. It should provide perpetual funds, in\nthe disposal of Congress, by a land tax, poll tax, or the like. All\nimposts upon commerce ought to be laid by Congress, and appropriated\nto their use. For, without certain revenues, a Government can have no\npower. That power which holds the purse-strings absolutely, must rule.\nThis seems to be a medium which, without making Congress altogether\nindependent, will tend to give reality to its authority.\n\nAnother defect in our system, is want of method and energy in the\nadministration. This has partly resulted from the other defect; but\nin a great degree from prejudice, and the want of a proper executive.\nCongress have kept the power too much in their own hands, and have\nmeddled too much with details of every sort. Congress is, properly, a\ndeliberative corps; and it forgets itself when it attempts to play the\nexecutive. It is impossible such a body, numerous as it is, constantly\nfluctuating, can ever act with sufficient decision, or with system.\nTwo-thirds of the members, one half the time, cannot know what has\ngone before them, or what connection the subject in hand has to what\nhas been transacted on former occasions. The members who have been\nmore permanent, will only give information that promotes the side they\nespouse in the present case; and will as often mislead as enlighten.\nThe variety of business must distract; and the proneness of every\nassembly to debate, must at all times delay.\n\nLately, Congress, convinced of these inconveniences, have gone into the\nmeasure of appointing Boards. But this is, in my opinion, a bad plan.\n\nA single man, in each department of the administration, would be\ngreatly preferable. It would give us a chance of more knowledge, more\nactivity, more responsibility, and, of course, more zeal and attention.\nBoards partake of a part of the inconveniences of larger assemblies.\nTheir decisions are slower, their energy less, their responsibility\nmore diffused. They will not have the same abilities and knowledge as\nan administration by single men. Men of the first pretensions will not\nso readily engage in them; because they will be less conspicuous, of\nless importance, have less opportunity of distinguishing themselves.\nThe members of Boards will take less pains to inform themselves and\narrive to eminence, because they have fewer motives to do it. All\nthese reasons conspire to give a preference to the plan of vesting the\ngreat executive departments of the State in the hands of individuals.\nAs these men will be, of course, at all times under the direction of\nCongress, we shall blend the advantages of a Monarchy and Republic in\nour constitution.\n\nA question has been made, whether single men could be found to\nundertake these offices. I think they could; because there would be\nthen every thing to excite the ambition of candidates. But, in order\nto this, Congress, by their manner of appointing them, and the line of\nduty marked out, must show that they are in earnest in making these\nofficers, officers of real trust and importance.\n\nI fear a little vanity has stood in the way of these arrangements, as\nthough they would lessen the importance of Congress, and leave them\nnothing to do. But they would have precisely the same rights and powers\nas heretofore, happily disencumbered of the detail. They would have to\ninspect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate upon their plans,\noriginate others for the public good; only observing this rule: that\nthey ought to consult their ministers, and get all the information and\nadvice they could from them, before they entered into any new measures,\nor made changes in the old.\n\nA third defect is, the fluctuating constitution of our army. This\nhas been a pregnant source of evil: all our military misfortunes,\nthree-fourths of our civil embarrassments, are to be ascribed to it.\nThe General has so fully enumerated the mischiefs of it, in a letter of\nthe â â â, to Congress, that I could only repeat what he has said, and\nwill therefore refer you to that letter.\n\nThe imperfect and unequal provision made for the army, is a fourth\ndefect, which you will find delineated in the same letter. Without a\nspeedy change, the army must dissolve. It is now a mob, rather than an\narmy; without clothing, without pay, without provision, without morals,\nwithout discipline. We begin to hate the country for its neglect of\nus. The country begin to hate us for our oppressions of them. Congress\nhave long been jealous of us. We have now lost all confidence in them,\nand give the worst construction to all they do. Held together by the\nslenderest ties, we are ripening for a dissolution.\n\nThe present mode of supplying the army, by State purchases, is not one\nof the least considerable defects of our system. It is too precarious\na dependence; because the States will never be sufficiently impressed\nwith our necessities. Each will make its own ease a primary object; the\nsupply of the army a secondary one. The variety of channels through\nwhich the business is transacted, will multiply the number of persons\nemployed, and the opportunities of embezzling public money. From the\npopular spirit on which most of the Governments turn, the State agents\nwill be men of less character and ability: nor will there be so rigid\na responsibility among them, as there might easily be among those in\nthe employ of the Continent; of course, not so much diligence, care, or\neconomy. Very little of the money raised in the several States, will go\ninto the Continental treasury, on pretence, that it is all exhausted in\nproviding the quotas of supplies; and the public will be without funds\nfor the other demands of Government. The expense will be ultimately\nmuch greater, and the advantages much smaller. We actually feel the\ninsufficiency of this plan; and have reason to dread, under it, a\nruinous extremity of want.\n\nThese are the principal defects, in the present system, that now occur\nto me. There are many inferior ones, in the organization of particular\ndepartments, and many errors of administration, which might be pointed\nout; but the task would be troublesome and tedious: and if we had once\nremedied those I have mentioned, the others would not be attended with\nmuch difficulty.\n\nI shall now propose the remedies, which appear to me applicable to\nour circumstances, and necessary to extricate our affairs from their\npresent deplorable situation. The first step must be, to give Congress\npowers competent to the public exigencies. This may happen in two ways:\none, by resuming and exercising the discretionary powers I suppose to\nhave been originally vested in them, for the safety of the States;\nand resting their conduct on the candor of their countrymen, and\nthe necessity of the conjuncture: the other, by calling immediately\na Convention of all the States, with full authority to conclude\nfinally upon a General Confederation; stating to them, beforehand,\nexplicitly, the evils arising from a want of power in Congress, and\nthe impossibility of supporting the contest on its present footing;\nthat the delegates may come, possessed of proper sentiments, as well\nas proper authority, to give efficacy to the meeting. Their commission\nshould include a right of vesting Congress with the whole, or a\nproportion, of the unoccupied lands, to be employed for the purpose of\nraising a revenue: reserving the jurisdiction to the States by whom\nthey are granted.\n\nThe first plan, I expect, will be thought too bold an expedient, by the\ngenerality of Congress; and, indeed, their practice hitherto, has so\nriveted the opinion of their want of power, that the success of this\nexperiment may very well be doubted.\n\nI see no objection to the other mode, that has any weight, in\ncompetition with the reasons for it. The Convention should assemble the\nfirst of November next. The sooner the better. Our disorders are too\nviolent to admit of a common or lingering remedy. The reasons for which\nI require them to be vested with plenipotentiary authority, are, that\nthe business may suffer no delay in the execution; and may, in reality,\ncome to effect. A Convention may agree upon a Confederation: the\nStates, individually, hardly ever will. We must have one at all events,\nand a vigorous one, if we mean to succeed in the contest, and be happy\nhereafter. As I said before, to engage the States to comply with this\nmode, Congress ought to confess to them, plainly and unanimously, the\nimpracticability of supporting our affairs on the present footing, and\nwithout a solid coercive union. I ask, that the Convention should have\na power of vesting the whole, or a part, of the unoccupied lands in\nCongress; because it is necessary that body should have some property,\nas a fund for the arrangements of finance; and I know of no other kind\nthat can be given them.\n\nThe Confederation, in my opinion, should give Congress complete\nsovereignty; except as to that part of internal police, which relates\nto the rights of property and life among individuals, and to raising\nmoney by internal taxes. It is necessary that every thing belonging\nto this, should be regulated by the State legislatures. Congress\nshould have complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, peace,\ntrade, finance; and to the management of foreign affairs; the right of\ndeclaring war; of raising armies, officering, paying them, directing\ntheir motions in every respect; of equipping fleets, and doing the same\nwith them; of building fortifications, arsenals, magazines, etc., etc.;\nof making peace on such conditions as they think proper; of regulating\ntrade, determining with what countries it shall be carried on; granting\nindulgencies; laying prohibitions on all the articles of export, or\nimport; imposing duties; granting bounties and premiums for raising,\nexporting, or importing, and applying to their own use, the product of\nthese duties; only giving credit to the States on whom they are raised,\nin the general account of revenues and expenses; instituting Admiralty\nCourts, etc.; of coining money; establishing Banks on such terms, and\nwith such privileges, as they think proper; appropriating funds, and\ndoing whatever else relates to the operations of finance; transacting\nevery thing with foreign nations; making alliances, offensive and\ndefensive; treaties of commerce, etc., etc.\n\nThe Confederation should provide certain perpetual revenues,\nproductive, and easy of collection; a land tax, poll tax, or the like;\nwhich, together with the duties on trade, and the unlocated lands,\nwould give Congress a substantial existence, and a stable foundation\nfor their schemes of finance. What more supplies were necessary, should\nbe occasionally demanded of the States, in the present mode of quotas.\n\nThe second step I would recommend, is, that Congress should instantly\nappoint the following great officers of State. A Secretary for Foreign\nAffairs, a President of War, a President of Marine, a Financier, a\nPresident of Trade. Instead of this last, a Board of Trade may be\npreferable, as the regulations of trade are slow and gradual; and\nrequire prudence and experience more than other qualities; for which\nBoards are very well adapted.\n\nCongress should choose for these offices, men of the first abilities,\nproperty, and character, in the Continent; and such as have had the\nbest opportunities of being acquainted with the several branches.\nGeneral Schuyler, whom you mentioned, would make an excellent President\nof War; General MâDougall a very good President of Marine. Mr. Robert\nMorris would have many things in his favor for the department of\nfinance. He could, by his own personal influence, give great weight to\nthe measures he should adopt. I dare say men, equally capable, may be\nfound for the other departments.\n\nI know not if it would not be a good plan to let the Financier be\nPresident of the Board of Trade; but he should only have a casting\nvoice in determining questions there. There is a connection between\ntrade and finance, which ought to make the director of one acquainted\nwith the other; but the Financier should not direct the affairs of\ntrade, because, for the sake of acquiring reputation by increasing the\nrevenues, he might adopt measures that would depress trade. In what\nrelates to finance, he should be alone.\n\nThese officers should have nearly the same powers and functions as\nthose in France analogous to them: and each should be Chief in his\ndepartment; with subordinate Boards, composed of assistants, clerks,\netc., to execute his orders.\n\nIn my opinion, a plan of this kind would be of inconceivable utility to\nour affairs: its benefits would be very speedily felt. It would give\nnew life and energy to the operations of Government. Business would be\nconducted with dispatch, method, and system. A million of abuses, now\nexisting, would be corrected; and judicious plans would be formed and\nexecuted for the public good.\n\nAnother step of immediate necessity, is, to recruit the army for the\nwar, or at least for three years. This must be done by a mode similar\nto that which is practised in Sweden. There the inhabitants are thrown\ninto classes of sixteen; and when the sovereign wants men, each of\nthese classes must furnish one. They raise a fixed sum of money; and\nif one of the class is willing to become a soldier, he receives the\nmoney and offers himself a volunteer. If none is found to do this, a\ndraught is made; and he on whom the lot falls, receives the money, and\nis obliged to serve.\n\nThe minds of the people are prepared for a thing of this kind. The\nheavy bounties they have been obliged to pay for men to serve a few\nmonths, must have disgusted them with this mode, and made them desirous\nof another, that will, once for all, answer the public purposes, and\nobviate a repetition of the demand. It ought, by all means, to be\nattempted; and Congress should frame a general plan, and press the\nexecution upon the States.\n\nWhen the Confederation comes to be framed, it ought to provide for this\nby a fundamental law; and hereafter there would be no doubt of the\nsuccess.\n\nBut we cannot now wait for this. We want to replace the men whose times\nof service will expire the first of January: for then, without this, we\nshall have no army remaining; and the enemy may do what they please.\nThe General, in his letter already quoted, has assigned the most\nsubstantial reasons for paying immediate attention to this point.\n\nCongress should endeavor, both upon their credit in Europe, and\nby every possible exertion in this country, to provide clothing\nfor their officers; and should abolish the whole system of State\nsupplies. The making good the depreciation of the currency, and all\nother compensations to the army, should be immediately taken up by\nCongress, and not left to the States. If they would have the accounts\nof depreciation liquidated, and governmental certificates given for\nwhat is due, in specie, or an equivalent to specie, it would give\nsatisfaction; appointing periodical settlements for future depreciation.\n\nThe placing the officers upon half-pay during life, would be a great\nstroke of policy; and would give Congress a stronger tie upon them\nthan any thing else they can do. No man, that reflects a moment,\nbut will prefer a permanent provision of this kind to any temporary\ncompensation. Nor is it opposed to economy: the difference between\nthis, and between what has already been done, will be insignificant.\nThe benefit of it to the widows should be confined to those whose\nhusbands die during the war. As to the survivors, not more than one\nhalf, on the usual calculation of menâs lives, will exceed the seven\nyears for which the half-pay is already established. Beside this,\nwhatever may be the visionary speculations of some men at this time,\nwe shall find it indispensable, after the war, to keep on foot a\nconsiderable body of troops: and all the officers, retained for this\npurpose, must be deducted out of the half-pay list. If any one will\ntake the pains to calculate the expense of these principles, I am\npersuaded he will find the addition of expense, from the establishment\nproposed, by no means a national object.\n\nThe advantages of securing the attachment of the army to Congress, and\nbinding them to the service by substantial ties, are immense. We should\nthen have discipline; an army in reality, as well as in name. Congress\nwould then have a solid basis of authority and consequence: for, to me,\nit is an axiom, that in our constitution, an army is essential to the\nAmerican Union.\n\nThe providing of supplies, is the pivot of every thing else (though a\nwell-constituted army would, not in a small degree, conduce to this, by\ngiving consistency and weight to Government). There are four ways, all\nof which must be united: A foreign loan; heavy pecuniary taxes; a tax\nin kind; a Bank founded on public and private credit.\n\nAs to a foreign loan, I dare say Congress are doing every thing in\ntheir power to obtain it. The most effectual way will be to tell\nFrance, that, without it, we must make terms with Great Britain.\nThis must be done with plainness and firmness; but with respect, and\nwithout petulance; not as a menace, but as a candid declaration of our\ncircumstances.\n\nWe need not fear to be deserted by France. Her interest and honor\nare too deeply involved in our fate; and she can make no possible\ncompromise. She can assist us, if she is convinced it is absolutely\nnecessary; either by lending us, herself, or by becoming our surety,\nor by influencing Spain. It has been to me astonishing, how any man\ncould have doubted, at any period of our affairs, of the necessity of\na foreign loan. It was self-evident, that we had not a fund of wealth\nin this country capable of affording revenues equal to the expenses. We\nmust then create artificial revenues, or borrow. The first was done;\nbut it ought to have been foreseen that the expedient could not last,\nand we should have provided in time for its failure.\n\nHere was an error of Congress. I have good reason to believe, that\nmeasures were not taken, in earnest, early enough to procure a loan\nabroad. I give you my honor, that from our first outset, I thought as\nI do now, and wished for a foreign loan; not only because I foresaw\nit would be essential, but because I considered it as a tie upon the\nnation from which it was derived, and as a mean to prop our cause in\nEurope.\n\nConcerning the necessity of heavy pecuniary taxes, I need say nothing;\nas it is a point in which every body is agreed. Nor is there any\ndanger, that the product of any taxes, raised in this way, will\noverburthen the people, or exceed the wants of the public. Indeed, if\nall the paper in circulation were drawn annually into the treasury, it\nwould neither do one nor the other.\n\nAs to a tax in kind, the necessity of it results from this principle:\nthat the money in circulation is not a sufficient representative of\nthe productions of the country; and, consequently, no revenues, raised\nfrom it as a medium, can be a competent representative of that part\nof the products of the country which it is bound to contribute to\nthe support of the public. The public, therefore, to obtain its due,\nor satisfy its just demands, and its wants, must call for a part of\nthose products themselves. This is done in all those countries which\nare not commercial: in Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, etc., and is\npeculiarly necessary in our case.\n\nCongress, in calling for specific supplies, seem to have had this\nin view; but their intention has not been answered. The States, in\ngeneral, have undertaken to furnish supplies by purchase; a mode, as I\nhave observed, attended with every inconvenience, and subverting the\nprinciple on which the supplies were demanded; the insufficiency of our\ncirculating medium as a representative for the labor and commodities\nof the country. It is therefore necessary that Congress should be more\nexplicit; should form the outlines of a plan for a tax in kind, and\nrecommend it to the States as a measure of absolute necessity.\n\nThe general idea I have of a plan, is, that a respectable man should\nbe appointed by the State, in each county, to collect the taxes\nand form magazines; that Congress should have, in each State, an\nofficer to superintend the whole; and that the State collectors\nshould be subordinate and responsible to them. This Continental\nSuperintendent might be subject to the general direction of the\nQuarter-Master-General, or not, as might be deemed best; but if not\nsubject to him, he should be obliged to make monthly returns to\nthe President at War, who should instruct him what proportion to\ndeliver to the Quarter-Master-General. It may be necessary, that the\nSuperintendents should sometimes have power to dispose of the articles\nin their possession, on public account; for it would happen, that the\ncontributions, in places remote from the army, could not be transported\nto the theatre of operations without too great expense; in which case\nit would be eligible to dispose of them, and purchase, with the money\nso raised, in the countries near the immediate scene of war.\n\nI know the objections which may be raised to this plan; its tendency\nto discourage industry, and the like. But necessity calls for it. We\ncannot proceed without it: and less evils must give place to greater.\nIt is, besides, practised with success in other countries, and why not\nin this? It may be said, the examples cited are from nations under\ndespotic governments; and that the same would not be practicable with\nus. But I contend, where the public good is evidently the object, more\nmay be effected in governments like ours, than in any other. It has\nbeen a constant remark, that free countries have ever paid the heaviest\ntaxes. The obedience of a free people to general laws, however hard\nthey bear, is ever more perfect than that of slaves to the arbitrary\nwill of a prince. To this may be added, that Sweden was always a free\ngovernment; and is so now, in a great degree, notwithstanding the late\nrevolution. How far it may be practicable to erect a Bank on the\njoint credit of the public and of individuals, can only be certainly\ndetermined by the experiment. But it is of so much importance, that the\nexperiment ought to be fully tried. When I saw the subscriptions going\non to the Bank established for supplying the army, I was in hopes it\nwas only the embryo of a more permanent and extensive establishment.\nBut I have reason to believe I shall be disappointed. It does not seem\nto be at all conducted on the true principles of a Bank.\n\nThe Directors of it are purchasing with their Stock, instead of Bank\nnotes, as I expected: in consequence of which, it must turn out to be a\nmere subscription of a particular sum of money for a particular purpose.\n\nPaper credit never was long supported in any country, on a national\nscale, where it was not founded on a joint basis of public and private\ncredit. An attempt to establish it on public credit alone, in France,\nunder the auspices of Mr. Law, had nearly ruined the kingdom. We have\nseen the effects of it in America; and every successive experiment,\nproves the futility of the attempt. Our new money is depreciating\nalmost as fast as the old; though it has, in some States, as real funds\nas paper money ever had. The reason is, that the moneyed men have not\nan immediate interest to uphold its credit. They may even, in many\nways, find it their interest to undermine it. The only certain manner\nto obtain a permanent paper credit, is to engage the moneyed interest\nimmediately in it, by making them contribute the whole, or part of the\nStock, and giving them the whole, or part of the profits.\n\nThe invention of Banks, on the modern principle, originated in Venice.\nThere the public, and a Company of moneyed men, are mutually concerned.\nThe Bank of England unites public authority and faith with private\ncredit: and hence we see, what a vast fabric of paper credit is raised\non a visionary basis. Had it not been for this, England would never\nhave found sufficient funds to carry on her wars: but, with the help\nof this, she has done, and is doing, wonders. The Bank of Amsterdam is\non a similar foundation. And why can we not have an American Bank?\nAre our moneyed men less enlightened to their own interest, or less\nenterprising in the pursuit? I believe the fault is in Government,\nwhich does not exert itself to engage them in such a scheme. It is\ntrue, the individuals in America are not very rich; but this would not\nprevent their instituting a Bank; it would only prevent its being done\nwith such ample funds as in other countries. Have they not sufficient\nconfidence in the Government, and in the issue of the cause? Let\nthe Government endeavor to inspire that confidence, by adopting the\nmeasures I have recommended, or others equivalent to them. Let it\nexert itself to procure a solid Confederation; to establish a good\nplan of executive administration; to form a permanent military force;\nto obtain, at all events, a foreign loan. If these things were in a\ntrain of vigorous execution, it would give a new spring to our affairs;\nGovernment would recover its respectability, and individuals would\nrenounce their diffidence.\n\nThe object I should propose to myself, in the first instance, from\na Bank, would be an auxiliary mode of supplies; for which purpose,\ncontracts should be made, between Government and the Bank, on terms\nliberal and advantageous to the latter. Every thing should be done,\nin the first instance, to encourage the Bank. After it gets well\nestablished, it will take care of itself; and Government may make the\nbest terms it can, for itself.\n\nThe first step to establishing the Bank, will be to engage a number of\nmoneyed men of influence to relish the project, and make it a business.\nThe subscribers to that lately established, are the fittest persons\nthat can be found; and their plan may be interwoven.\n\nThe outlines of my plan would be, to open subscriptions in all the\nStates; for the Stock, which we will suppose to be one million of\npounds. Real property of every kind, as well as specie, should be\ndeemed good Stock; but at least a fourth part of the subscription\nshould be in specie, or plate. There should be one great Company, in\nthree divisions: in Virginia, Philadelphia, and at Boston; or two at\nPhiladelphia and Boston. The Bank should have a right to issue Bank\nnotes, bearing two per cent. interest, for the whole of their stock;\nbut not to exceed it. These notes may be payable every three months, or\noftener: and the faith of government must be pledged for the support of\nthe Bank. It must therefore have a right, from time to time, to inspect\nits operations, and must appoint inspectors for the purpose.\n\nThe advantages of the Bank may consist in this: in the profits of\nthe contracts made with Government, which should bear interest to\nbe annually paid in specie; in the loan of money at interest, say\nsix per cent.; in purchasing lives by annuities, as practised in\nEngland, etc. The benefit resulting to the Company, is evident from\nthe consideration, that they may employ, in circulation, a great\ndeal more money than they have specie in Stock, on the credit of the\nreal property which they will have in other use. This money will be\nemployed, either in fulfilling their contracts with the public, by\nwhich also they will gain a profit; or in loans at an advantageous\ninterest, or in annuities.\n\nThe Bank may be allowed to purchase plate and bullion, and coin money;\nallowing Government a part of the profit. I make the Bank notes bear\ninterest, to obtain a readier currency, and to induce the holders to\nprefer them to specie, to prevent too great a run upon the Bank, at any\ntime, beyond its ability to pay.\n\nIf Government can obtain a foreign loan, it should lend to the Bank,\non easy terms, to extend its influence, and facilitate a compliance\nwith its engagements. If Government could engage the States to raise\na sum of money in specie, to be deposited in Bank in the same manner,\nit would be of the greatest consequence. If Government could prevail\non the enthusiasm of the people, to make a contribution in plate for\nthe same purpose, it would be a master-stroke. Things of this kind\nsometimes succeed in popular contests; and, if undertaken with address,\nI should not despair of its success: but I should not be sanguine.\n\nThe Bank may be instituted for a term of years by way of trial; and the\nparticular privilege of coining money, be for a term still shorter.\nA temporary transfer of it to a particular Company, can have no\ninconvenience, as the Government are in no condition to improve this\nresource; nor could it, in our circumstances, be an object to them;\nthough, with the industry of a knot of individuals, it might be a\nvaluable one to them. A Bank of this kind, even in its commencement,\nwould answer the most valuable purposes to Government and to the\nproprietors: in its progress, the advantages will exceed calculation.\nIt will promote commerce, by furnishing a more extensive medium, which\nwe greatly want, in our circumstances. I mean a more extensive valuable\nmedium. We have an enormous nominal one at this time, but it is only a\nname.\n\nIn the present unsettled state of things in this country, we can hardly\ndraw inferences from what has happened in others; otherwise I should be\ncertain of the success of this scheme: but I think it has enough in its\nfavor to be worthy of trial.\n\nI have only skimmed the surface of the different subjects I have\nintroduced. Should the plans recommended come into contemplation, in\nearnest, and you desire my further thoughts, I will endeavor to give\nthem more form and particularity. I am persuaded a solid Confederation,\na permanent army, a reasonable prospect of subsisting it, would give us\ntreble consideration in Europe, and produce a peace this winter.\n\nIf a Convention is called, the minds of all the States, and the people,\nought to be prepared to receive its determinations by sensible and\npopular writings, which should conform to the views of Congress. There\nare epochs in human affairs when _novelty_ even is useful. If a general\nopinion prevails that the old way is bad, whether true or false, and\nthis obstructs or relaxes the operations of the public service, a\nchange is necessary, if it be but for the sake of change. This is\nexactly the case now. âTis a universal sentiment, that our present\nsystem is a bad one, and that things do not go right on this account.\nThe measure of a Convention would revive the hopes of the people,\nand give a new direction to their passions, which may be improved in\ncarrying points of substantial utility. The eastern States have already\npointed out this mode to Congress: they ought to take the hint and\nanticipate the others.\n\nAnd, in future, my dear sir, two things let me recommend, as\nfundamental rules for the conduct of Congress: to attach the army to\nthem by every motive; to maintain an air of authority (not domineering)\nin all their measures with the States. The manner in which a thing is\ndone, has more influence than is commonly imagined. Men are governed\nby opinion: this opinion is as much influenced by appearances as by\nrealities. If a Government appears to be confident of its own powers,\nit is the surest way to inspire the same confidence in others. If it is\ndiffident, it may be certain there will be a still greater diffidence\nin others; and that its authority will not only be distrusted,\ncontroverted, but contemned.\n\nI wish, too, Congress would always consider, that a kindness\nconsists as much in the manner as in the thing. The best things done\nhesitatingly, and with an ill grace, lose their effect, and produce\ndisgust rather than satisfaction or gratitude. In what Congress have at\nany time done for the army, they have commonly been too late. They have\nseemed to yield to importunity, rather than to sentiments of justice or\nto a regard to the accommodation of their troops. An attention to this\nidea, is of more importance than it may be thought. I, who have seen\nall the workings and progress of the present discontents, am convinced,\nthat a want of this has not been among the most inconsiderable causes.\n\nYou will perceive, my dear sir, this letter is hastily written, and\nwith a confidential freedom: not as to a member of Congress, whose\nfeelings may be sore at the prevailing clamors; but as to a friend, who\nis in a situation to remedy public disorders; who wishes for nothing so\nmuch as truth; and who is desirous of information, even from those less\ncapable of judging than himself. I have not even time to correct and\ncopy; and only enough to add, that I am, very truly and affectionately,\ndear sir,\n\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                                   1780.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nYour favor of the 17th I received on that day. That of the 13th has\ntaken a tour to Albany and was delivered me this moment.\n\nCommissioners will be appointed to meet the Eastern Convention; I\nbelieve Judge Hubbard, Mr. Benson, the Attorney General, and myself,\nwill go; the two gentlemen I have mentioned are as deeply impressed as\nmen can be with the necessity of more power in the directing councils,\nor what would be better in our present situation, ----. The lower house\nare for it, but the upper timid, although heartily disposed to every\nmeasure which will give vigor.\n\nI was too much indisposed to undertake the journey to Hartford,\nand continue so much so that I am obliged to quit this before the\nLegislature rises.\n\nI am informed Gates is to have the thanks of the Senate for not\ndespairing of the Commonwealth, but that they do not mean to tread\nwholly in the steps of the Romans, and confine him to subordinate\ncommands; he is to have a potent army, and to drive Cornwallis and his\ncrew into the sea with more rapidity than he flew to Hillsborough.\n\nPray entreat the General and the gentlemen of his family to accept of\nmy best wishes, in which you always partake.\n\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\n                                             Affectionately yours, etc.,\n                                             P. Schuyler.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MISS SCHUYLER.\n\n\n                                                      September 6, 1780.\n\nMost people here are groaning under a very disagreeable piece of\nintelligence just come from the southward, that Gates has had a total\ndefeat near Camden, in South Carolina. Cornwallis and he met in the\nnight of the fifteenth, by accident, marching to the same point. The\nadvanced guards skirmished, and the two armies halted and formed till\nmorning. In the morning a battle ensued, in which the militia, and\nGates with them, immediately ran away, and left the Continental troops\nto contend with the enemyâs whole force.\n\nThey did it obstinately, and probably are most of them cut off. Gates,\nhowever, who writes to Congress, seems to know very little what has\nbecome of his army. He showed that age and the long labors and fatigues\nof a military life had not in the least impaired his activity, for in\nthree days and a half he reached Hillsborough, one hundred and eighty\nmiles from the scene of action, leaving all his troops to take care of\nthemselves, and get out of the scrape as well as they could.\n\nHe has confirmed, in this instance, the opinion I always had of him.\nThis event will have very serious consequences to the southward.\nPeopleâs imaginations have already given up North Carolina and\nVirginia; but I do not believe either of them will fall. I am certain\nVirginia cannot. This misfortune affects me less than others, because\nit is not in my temper to repine at evils that are past, but to\nendeavor to draw good out of them, and because I think our safety\ndepends on a total change of system, and this change of system will\nonly be produced by misfortune.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\n\n\n                                                      September 6, 1780.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nThe letter accompanying this has lain by two or three days for want\nof an opportunity. I have heard since of Gatesâs defeat: a very good\ncomment on the necessity of changing our system. His passion for\nmilitia, I fancy, will be a little cured, and he will cease to think\nthem the best bulwark of American liberty. What think you of the\nconduct of this great man? I am his enemy personally, for unjust and\nunprovoked attacks upon my character; therefore what I say of him ought\nto be received as from an enemy, and have no more weight than as it\nis consistent with fact and common sense. But did ever any one hear\nof such a disposition or such a flight? His best troops placed on the\nside strongest by nature, his worst on that weakest by nature, and\nhis attack made with these. âTis impossible to give a more complete\npicture of military absurdity. It is equally against the maxims of\nwar and common sense. We see the consequences. His left ran away, and\nleft his right uncovered. His right wing turned on the left has in all\nprobability been cut off. Though, in truth, the General seems to have\nknown very little what became of his army.\n\nHad he placed his militia on his right, supported by the morass,\nand his Continental troops on his left, where it seems he was most\nvulnerable, his right would have been more secure, and his left would\nhave opposed the enemy; and instead of going backward when he ordered\nto attack, would have gone forward. The reverse of what has happened\nmight have happened.\n\nBut was there ever an instance of a General running away, as Gates\nhas done, from his whole army? And was there ever so precipitous a\nflight? One hundred and eighty miles in three days and a half. It does\nadmirable credit to the activity of a man at his time of life. But it\ndisgraces the General and the soldier. I always believed him to be very\nfar short of a Hector, or a Ulysses. All the world, I think, will begin\nto agree with me.\n\nBut what will be done by Congress? Will he be changed or not? If he is\nchanged, for Godâs sake overcome prejudice, and send Greene. You know\nmy opinion of him. I stake my reputation on the events, give him but\nfair play.\n\nBut, above all things, let us have, without delay, a vigorous,\ngovernment, and a well constituted army for the war.\n\n                                                   Adieu, my dear Sir,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nCOL. FLEURY TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                     Boston, September 7, 1780.\n\nIf you do write to me, direct your letters to General Heath, and under\nhis cover. I cannot tell why till I see you; I want it much.\n\nThe enemy have left Marthaâs Vineyard. It is reported they sailed to\nthe southward.\n\nI beg you would remember me to my friend Laurens; I have written to\nhim, but he keeps silent.\n\nI do not like your situation at Leeâs Fort: you throw the glove to\nClinton; he will take it, and we are not near enough to be your\nseconds. Our sick increase; not much; but they increase.\n\n                                      Farewell, your servant and friend,\n                                      F * * y.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO LAURENS.\n\n\n                                                        September, 1780.\n\nSince my return from Hartford, my dear Laurens, my mind has been too\nlittle at ease to permit me to write to you sooner. It has been wholly\noccupied by the affecting and tragic consequences of Arnoldâs treason.\nMy feelings were never put to so severe a trial. You will no doubt\nhave heard the principal facts before this reaches you. But there are\nparticulars, to which my situation gave me access, that cannot have\ncome to your knowledge from public report, which I am persuaded you\nwill find interesting.\n\nFrom several circumstances, the project seems to have originated\nwith Arnold himself, and to have been long premeditated. The first\noverture is traced back to some time in June last. It was conveyed in\na letter to Colonel Robinson; the substance of which was, that the\ningratitude he had experienced from his country, concurring with other\ncauses, had entirely changed his principles; that he now only sought\nto restore himself to the favor of his king, by some signal proof of\nhis repentance; and would be happy to open a correspondence with Sir\nHenry Clinton for that purpose. About this period he made a journey to\nConnecticut: on his return from which to Philadelphia, he solicited\nthe command of West Point; alleging that the effects of his wounds had\ndisqualified him for the active duties of the field. The sacrifice of\nthis important post was the atonement he intended to make. General\nWashington hesitated the less to gratify an officer who had rendered\nsuch eminent services, as he was convinced the post might be safely\nintrusted to one who had given so many distinguished specimens of his\nbravery. In the beginning of August he joined the army and renewed his\napplication. The enemy, at this juncture, had embarked the greatest\npart of their forces on an expedition to Rhode Island; and our army was\nin motion to compel them to relinquish the enterprise, or to attack\nNew-York in its weakened state. The General offered Arnold the left\nwing of the army, which he declined, on the pretext already mentioned,\nbut not without visible embarrassment. He certainly might have executed\nthe duties of such a temporary command; and it was expected from his\nenterprising temper, that he would gladly have embraced so splendid an\nopportunity. But he did not choose to be diverted a moment from his\nfavorite object; probably from an apprehension that some different\ndisposition might have taken place, which would have excluded him. The\nextreme solicitude he discovered to get possession of the post, would\nhave led to a suspicion of treachery, had it been possible, from his\npast conduct, to have supposed him capable of it.\n\nThe correspondence thus begun, was carried on between Arnold and Major\nAndrÃ©, Adjutant-General to the British army, in behalf of Sir Henry\nClinton, under feigned signatures, and in a mercantile disguise. In\nan intercepted letter of Arnoldâs, which lately fell into our hands,\nhe proposes an interview, âto settle the risks and profits of the\ncopartnership;â and, in the same style of metaphor, intimates an\nexpected augmentation of the garrison; and speaks of it as the means\nof extending their traffic. It appears, by another letter, that AndrÃ©\nwas to have met him on the lines, under the sanction of a flag, in the\ncharacter of Mr. John Anderson. But some cause or other, not known,\nprevented this interview.\n\nThe twentieth of last month, Robinson and AndrÃ© went up the river\nin the Vulture sloop-of-war. Robinson sent a flag to Arnold with\ntwo letters; one to General Putnam, inclosed in another to himself;\nproposing an interview with Putnam, or, in his absence, with Arnold, to\nadjust some private concerns. The one to General Putnam, was evidently\nmeant as a cover to the other, in case, by accident, the letters should\nhave fallen under the inspection of a third person.\n\nGeneral Washington crossed the river, on his way to Hartford, the day\nthese dispatches arrived. Arnold, conceiving he must have heard of the\nflag, thought it necessary, for the sake of appearances, to submit the\nletters to him, and ask his opinion of the propriety of complying with\nthe request. The General, with his usual caution, though without the\nleast surmise of the design, dissuaded him from it, and advised him\nto reply to Robinson, that whatever related to his private affairs,\nmust be of a civil nature, and could only properly be addressed to the\ncivil authority. This reference fortunately deranged the plan; and was\nthe first link in the chain of events that led to the detection. The\ninterview could no longer take place in the form of a flag, but was\nobliged to be managed in a secret manner.\n\nArnold employed one Smith to go on board the Vulture the night of\nthe twenty-second, to bring AndrÃ© on shore, with a pass for Mr. John\nAnderson. AndrÃ© came ashore accordingly; and was conducted within a\npicket of ours to the house of Smith, where Arnold and he remained\ntogether in close conference all that night and the day following.\nAt daylight in the morning, the commanding officer at Kingâs Ferry,\nwithout the privity of Arnold, moved a couple of pieces of cannon to\na point opposite to where the Vulture lay, and obliged her to take a\nmore remote station. This event, or some lurking distrust, made the\nboatmen refuse to convey the two passengers back, and disconcerted\nArnold so much, that by one of those strokes of infatuation which\noften confound the schemes of men conscious of guilt, he insisted on\nAndrÃ©âs exchanging his uniform for a disguise, and returning in a mode\ndifferent from that in which he came. AndrÃ©, who had been undesignedly\nbrought within our posts in the first instance, remonstrated warmly\nagainst this new and dangerous expedient. But Arnold persisting in\ndeclaring it impossible for him to return as he came, he at length\nreluctantly yielded to his direction, and consented to change his\ndress, and take the route he recommended. Smith furnished the disguise,\nand in the evening passed Kingâs Ferry with him, and proceeded to\nCrompond, where they stopped the remainder of the night, at the\ninstance of a militia officer, to avoid being suspected by him. The\nnext morning they resumed their journey, Smith accompanying AndrÃ©\na little beyond Pineâs Bridge, where he left him. He had reached\nTarrytown, when he was taken up by three militia men, who rushed out of\nthe woods and seized his horse.\n\nAt this critical moment, his presence of mind forsook him. Instead\nof producing his pass, which would have extricated him from our\nparties, and could have done him no harm with his own, he asked the\nmilitia men, if they were of the _upper_ or _lower_ party; distinctive\nappellations known among the enemyâs refugee corps. The militia men\nreplied, they were of the lower party; upon which he told them he\nwas a British officer, and pressed them not to detain him, as he was\nupon urgent business. This confession removed all doubts; and it was\nin vain he afterwards produced his pass. He was instantly forced off\nto a place of greater security, where, after a careful search, there\nwere found, concealed in the feet of his stockings, several papers\nof importance, delivered to him by Arnold! Among these, were a plan\nof the fortifications of West Point; a memorial from the engineer\non the attack and defence of the place; returns of the garrison,\ncannon, and stores; copy of the minutes of a council of war held by\nGeneral Washington a few weeks before. The prisoner, at first, was\ninadvertently ordered to Arnold; but on recollection, while still on\nthe way, he was countermanded, and sent to Old Salem. The papers were\ninclosed in a letter to General Washington, which, having taken a\nroute different from that by which he returned, made a circuit that\nafforded leisure for another letter, through an ill-judged delicacy,\nwritten to Arnold with information of Andersonâs capture, to get to him\nan hour before General Washington arrived at his quarters; time enough\nto elude the fate that awaited him. He went down the river in his barge\nto the Vulture with such precipitate confusion, that he did not take\nwith him a single paper useful to the enemy. On the first notice of the\naffair, he was pursued, but much too late to be overtaken.\n\nThere was some color for imagining it was a part of the plan to betray\nthe General into the hands of the enemy. Arnold was very anxious to\nascertain from him the precise day of his return; and the enemyâs\nmovements seem to have corresponded to this point. But if it was really\nthe case, it was very injudicious. The success must have depended\non surprise; and as the officers at the advanced posts were not in\nthe secret, their measures might have given the alarm; and General\nWashington, taking the command of the post, might have rendered the\nwhole scheme abortive. Arnold, it is true, had so dispersed the\ngarrison, as to have made a defence difficult, but not impracticable;\nand the acquisition of West Point was of such magnitude to the enemy,\nthat it would have been unwise to connect it with any other object,\nhowever great, which might make the obtaining of it precarious.\n\nArnold, a moment before the setting out, went into Mrs. Arnoldâs\napartment, and informed her that some transactions had just come to\nlight, which must for ever banish him from his country. She fell\ninto a swoon at this declaration: and he left her in it, to consult\nhis own safety, till the servants, alarmed by her cries, came to her\nrelief. She remained frantic all day; accusing every one who approached\nher, with an intention to murder her child (an infant in her arms);\nand exhibiting every other mark of the most genuine and agonizing\ndistress. Exhausted by the fatigue and tumult of her spirits, her\nphrensy subsided towards evening, and she sank into all the sadness\nof affliction. It was impossible not to have been touched with her\nsituation. Every thing affecting in female tears, or in the misfortunes\nof beauty; every thing pathetic in the wounded tenderness of a wife,\nor in the apprehensive fondness of a mother; and, till I have reason\nto change the opinion, I will add, every thing amiable in suffering\ninnocence; conspired to make her an object of sympathy to all who\nwere present. She experienced the most delicate attentions, and every\nfriendly office, till her departure for Philadelphia.\n\nAndrÃ© was, without loss of time, conducted to the head quarters of\nthe army, where he was immediately brought before a Board of General\nOfficers, to prevent all possibility of misrepresentation, or cavil\non the part of the enemy. The Board reported, that he ought to be\nconsidered as a spy, and, according to the laws of nations, to suffer\ndeath; which was executed two days after.\n\nNever, perhaps, did any man suffer death with more justice, or\ndeserve it less. The first step he took, after his capture, was to\nwrite a letter to General Washington, conceived in terms of dignity\nwithout insolence, and apology without meanness. The scope of it was\nto vindicate himself from the imputation of having assumed a mean\ncharacter for treacherous or interested purposes; asserting that he\nhad been involuntarily an impostor; that contrary to his intention,\nwhich was to meet a person for intelligence on neutral ground, he had\nbeen betrayed within our posts, and forced into the vile condition\nof an enemy in disguise; soliciting only, that, to whatever rigor\npolicy might devote him, a decency of treatment might be observed,\ndue to a person, who, though unfortunate, had been guilty of nothing\ndishonorable. His request was granted in its full extent; for, in the\nwhole progress of the affair, he was treated with the most scrupulous\ndelicacy. When brought before the Board of Officers, he met with every\nmark of indulgence, and was required to answer no interrogatory which\ncould even embarrass his feelings. On his part, while he carefully\nconcealed every thing that might involve others, he frankly confessed\nall the facts relating to himself; and, upon his confession, without\nthe trouble of examining a witness, the Board made their Report. The\nmembers of it were not more impressed with the candor and firmness,\nmixed with a becoming sensibility, which he displayed, than he was\npenetrated with their liberality and politeness. He acknowledged\nthe generosity of the behavior towards him in every respect, but\nparticularly in this, in the strongest terms of manly gratitude. In\na conversation with a gentleman who visited him after his trial, he\nsaid he flattered himself he had never been illiberal; but if there\nwere any remains of prejudice in his mind, his present experience must\nobliterate them.\n\nIn one of the visits I made to him (and I saw him several times during\nhis confinement), he begged me to be the bearer of a request to the\nGeneral, for permission to send an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton.\nâI foresee my fate,â said he, âand though I pretend not to play the\nhero, or to be indifferent about life; yet I am reconciled to whatever\nmay happen, conscious that misfortune, not guilt, has brought it upon\nme. There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity. Sir Henry\nClinton has been too good to me; he has been lavish of his kindness. I\nam bound to him by too many obligations, and love him too well, to bear\nthe thought, that he should reproach himself, or that others should\nreproach him, on the supposition of my having conceived myself obliged,\nby his instructions, to run the risk I did. I would not, for the world,\nleave a sting in his mind that should imbitter his future days.â He\ncould scarce finish the sentence, bursting into tears in spite of his\nefforts to suppress them; and with difficulty collected himself enough\nafterwards to add: âI wish to be permitted to assure him, I did not act\nunder this impression, but submitted to a necessity imposed upon me,\nas contrary to my own inclination as to his orders.â His request was\nreadily complied with; and he wrote the letter annexed, with which I\ndare say you will be as much pleased as I am, both for the diction and\nsentiment.\n\nWhen his sentence was announced to him, he remarked, that since it\nwas his lot to die, there was still a choice in the mode, which would\nmake a material difference in his feelings; and he would be happy, if\npossible, to be indulged with a professional death. He made a second\napplication, by letter, in concise but persuasive terms. It was thought\nthis indulgence, being incompatible with the customs of war, could not\nbe granted; and it was therefore determined, in both cases, to evade an\nanswer, to spare him the sensations which a certain knowledge of the\nintended mode would inflict.\n\nIn going to the place of execution, he bowed familiarly as he\nwent along, to all those with whom he had been acquainted in his\nconfinement. A smile of complacency expressed the serene fortitude of\nhis mind. Arrived at the fatal spot, he asked, with some emotion, âMust\nI then die in this manner?â He was told it had been unavoidable. âI am\nreconciled to my fate,â said he, âbut not to the mode.â Soon, however,\nrecollecting himself, he added: âIt will be but a momentary pang:â\nand, springing upon the cart, performed the last offices to himself,\nwith a composure that excited the admiration, and melted the hearts\nof the beholders. Upon being told the final moment was at hand, and\nasked if he had any thing to say, he answered, âNothing but to request\nyou will witness to the world, that I die like a brave man.â Among the\nextraordinary circumstances that attended him, in the midst of his\nenemies, he died universally esteemed and universally regretted.\n\nThere was something singularly interesting in the character and\nfortunes of AndrÃ©. To an excellent understanding, well improved by\neducation and travel, he united a peculiar elegance of mind and\nmanners, and the advantage of a pleasing person. âTis said he possessed\na pretty taste for the fine arts, and had himself attained some\nproficiency in poetry, music, and painting. His knowledge appeared\nwithout ostentation, and embellished by a diffidence that rarely\naccompanies so many talents and accomplishments: which left you to\nsuppose more than appeared. His sentiments were elevated, and inspired\nesteem: they had a softness that conciliated affection. His elocution\nwas handsome: his address easy, polite, and insinuating. By his merit,\nhe had acquired the unlimited confidence of his General, and was\nmaking a rapid progress in military rank and reputation. But in the\nheight of his career, flushed with new hopes from the execution of a\nproject, the most beneficial to his party that could be devised, he was\nat once precipitated from the summit of prosperity, and saw all the\nexpectations of his ambition blasted, and himself ruined.\n\nThe character I have given of him, is drawn partly from what I saw\nof him myself, and partly from information. I am aware that a man of\nreal merit is never seen in so favorable a light as through the medium\nof adversity: the clouds that surround him, are shades that set off\nhis good qualities. Misfortune cuts down the little vanities that, in\nprosperous times, serve as so many spots in his virtues; and gives a\ntone of humility that makes his worth more amiable. His spectators,\nwho enjoy a happier lot, are less prone to detract from it, through\nenvy, and are more disposed, by compassion, to give him the credit he\ndeserves, and perhaps even to magnify it.\n\nI speak not of AndrÃ©âs conduct in this affair as a philosopher, but as\na man of the world. The authorized maxims and practices of war, are\nthe satires of human nature. They countenance almost every species\nof seduction as well as violence; and the General who can make most\ntraitors in the army of his adversary, is frequently most applauded. On\nthis scale we acquit AndrÃ©; while we could not but condemn him, if we\nwere to examine his conduct by the sober rules of philosophy and moral\nrectitude. It is, however, a blemish on his fame, that he once intended\nto prostitute a flag: about this, a man of nice honor ought to have had\na scruple; but the temptation was great: let his misfortunes cast a\nveil over his error.\n\nSeveral letters from Sir Henry Clinton and others, were received in the\ncourse of the affair, feebly attempting to prove, that AndrÃ© came out\nunder the protection of a flag, with a passport from a general officer\nin actual service; and consequently could not be justly detained.\nClinton sent a deputation, composed of Lieutenant-General Robinson,\nMr. Elliot, and Mr. William Smith, to represent, as he said, the true\nstate of Major AndrÃ©âs case. General Greene met Robinson, and had a\nconversation with him; in which he reiterated the pretence of a flag;\nurged AndrÃ©âs release as a personal favor to Sir Henry Clinton; and\noffered any friend of ours, in their power, in exchange. Nothing could\nhave been more frivolous than the plea which was used. The fact was,\nthat beside the time, manner, object of the interview, change of dress,\nand other circumstances, there was not a single formality customary\nwith flags; and the passport was not to Major AndrÃ©, but to Mr.\nAnderson. But had there been, on the contrary, all the formalities, it\nwould be an abuse of language to say, that the sanction of a flag for\ncorrupting an officer to betray his trust, ought to be respected. So\nunjustifiable a purpose, would not only destroy its validity, but make\nit an aggravation.\n\nAndrÃ©, himself, has answered the argument, by ridiculing and exploding\nthe idea, in his examination before the Board of Officers. It was a\nweakness to urge it.\n\nThere was, in truth, no way of saving him. Arnold, or he, must have\nbeen the victim: the former was out of our power.\n\nIt was by some suspected, Arnold had taken his measures in such a\nmanner, that if the interview had been discovered in the act, it might\nhave been in his power to sacrifice AndrÃ© to his own security. This\nsurmise of double treachery, made them imagine Clinton might be induced\nto give up Arnold for AndrÃ©; and a gentleman took occasion to suggest\nthis expedient to the latter, as a thing that might be proposed by him.\nHe declined it. The moment he had been capable of so much frailty, I\nshould have ceased to esteem him.\n\nThe infamy of Arnoldâs conduct previous to his desertion, is only\nequalled by his baseness since. Beside the folly of writing to Sir\nHenry Clinton, assuring him that AndrÃ© had acted under a passport from\nhim, and according to his directions while commanding officer at a\npost; and that, therefore, he did not doubt, he would be immediately\nsent in; he had the effrontery to write to General Washington in the\nsame spirit; with the addition of a menace of retaliation, if the\nsentence should be carried into execution. He has since acted the farce\nof sending in his resignation. This man is, in every sense, despicable.\nAdded to the scene of knavery and prostitution during his command in\nPhiladelphia, which the late seizure of his papers has unfolded; the\nhistory of his command at West Point is a history of little, as well\nas great, villanies. He practised every dirty art of peculation; and\neven stooped to connections with the suttlers of the garrison, to\ndefraud the public.\n\nTo his conduct, that of the captors of AndrÃ© forms a striking contrast.\nHe tempted them with the offer of his watch, his horse, and any sum\nof money they should name. They rejected his offers with indignation:\nand the gold that could seduce a man high in the esteem and confidence\nof his country, who had the remembrance of past exploits, the motives\nof present reputation and future glory, to prop his integrity, had\nno charms for three simple peasants, leaning only on their virtue\nand an honest sense of their duty. While Arnold is handed down, with\nexecration, to future times, posterity will repeat, with reverence, the\nnames of Van Wart, Paulding, and Williams.\n\nI congratulate you, my friend, on our happy escape from the mischiefs\nwith which this treason was big. It is a new comment on the value of an\nhonest man, and if it were possible, would endear you to me more than\never.\n\n                                                   Adieu,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                  Poughkeepsie, Sept. 10, 1780.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI am very apprehensive the unhappy event, mentioned in your favor of\nthe fifth instant, will draw very serious consequences in its train. It\nwill certainly much embarrass us, and probably retard the termination\nof the war. It will, however, be attended with one good; the adherents,\nin Congress, to the gallant Commander, will not have it any longer in\ntheir power to play him off against the General. Gracious God! that\nany rational being should put two men in competition, one of which has\n_commanded_ an army, the other only been at the head of one; for I\naver, that when he was to the northward, he never made a disposition of\nhis troops. Indeed he was incapable: he never saw an enemy, except at\na good distance, and from places of perfect security. Indeed, indeed,\nhe has not lost a whit, in my estimation, by this stroke of his.\n\nThe General will have shown you extracts from the Senate and Assemblyâs\nAddresses to the Governor. A Committee of both Houses is appointed to\nreport on the proceedings of the Convention: they will certainly adopt\nand extend the views of that Convention. Some here are for appointing\na Dictator, with a Vice Dictator in each State, invested with all the\npowers conferred formerly by the Roman people on theirs. I made great\ninterest to be left out of the delegation, and obtained it, although\nnot without much difficulty. General MâDougal is appointed in my stead:\nbut I believe I shall be obliged to go to the eastern Convention. If\nso, I shall not repair to Rhode Island so soon as I intended.\n\nColonel Warner is wounded, and two of his officers killed near Fort\nEdward.\n\nPray make my respects acceptable to the General, to the gentlemen of\nthe family, the Marquis, and those of his.\n\n                                      Adieu.\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\n                                      Very affectionately and sincerely,\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\n                                      Ph. Schuyler.\n\nI forgot to inform the General that the Governor had sent him an\nextract of the proceedings of the Convention which I had promised to\ntransmit.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                              Poughkeepsie, September 16, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe great scarcity of wheat before harvest, and the drought since,\nhas prevented the agent appointed to collect the supply required from\nthis State, to deliver it to the Issuing Commissary; and we are at\nleast ten thousand barrels in arrears; the wheat for all which is\nalready assessed, a considerable quantity of it brought to the mills\nto be manufactured, and the remainder daily collecting. Hence, unless\na second drought should prevail, our deficiency can be made good in\nthe course of a month: and this may be relied on. But should the\narmy actually be in operation, I do not _make a doubt_ but that the\nhand of Government will be laid on all in the country; and, in that\ncase, a constant supply can be kept up so as to complete to thirty\nthousand barrels, and perhaps half as much more, should Congress\norder the quota of Pennsylvania (if she deigns to furnish any) to be\nsold, and the money transmitted to this State. Exclusive of the wheat\nalready assessed to complete our quota of flour, the inhabitants of\nTryon County, and the western part of Albany, are threshing. This the\nLegislature has ordered to be purchased for a State Magazine, should we\nnot be able to purchase the whole. The whole may, however, be obtained,\nand without delay, if an operation takes place: to procure flour casks\nis the greatest difficulty. I wish those at West Point were ordered\nto be immediately put in order: those, and an aid of bags, may be\nnecessary.\n\nI have communed with the Governor on the subject of MâHenryâs wish. He\nis very much disposed to use his influence on the occasion, but doubts\nif he should be able to obtain a Lieutenancy, unless the Ensigns that\nnow are, could all be provided for. If MâHenry merely wants military\nrank for the campaign, and will not accept of an Ensigncy, the Governor\ncan, and will, give him a Lieutenant-Colonelcy in the State Levies,\nwhich will always give him rank in our militia, and, consequently, in\nthe army, when the militia is in the field. But this must be determined\nbefore the Legislature rises. Please, therefore, to desire MâHenry to\nwrite me on the subject without delay, and to assure him of the best\nservices in my power.\n\nIf I knew when you would be at Fishkill, if you pass that way, I would\nmeet you there. Or if I believed it would not be disagreeable to the\nGeneral, I would go to Hartford, as I wish to see the other Sachem.\n\nA spirit favorable to the common cause, has pervaded almost both\nHouses. They begin to talk of a Dictator and Vice Dictators, as if\nit was a thing that was already determined on. To the Convention to\nbe held at Hartford, I believe I shall be sent, with instructions to\npropose that a Dictator should be appointed.\n\nI have just seen Van Schaickâs whim. There is not one Lieutenancy\nvacant.\n\nI have had the inclosed several days with me, for want of a conveyance.\nPlease to dispatch the bearer as expeditiously back as you can.\nCompliments to all.\n\n                             I am, dear Sir, affectionately yours, etc.,\n                             Ph. Schuyler.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GREENE.\n\n\n                                                   25th September, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere has just been unfolded at this place a scene of the blackest\ntreason. Arnold has fled to the enemy--AndrÃ©, the British Adjutant\nGeneral, is in our possession as a spy. His capture unravelled the\nmystery.\n\nWest Point was to have been the sacrifice. All the dispositions have\nbeen made for the purpose, and âtis possible, though not probable, we\nmay still see the execution. The wind is fair. I came here in pursuit\nof Arnold, but was too late. I advise your putting the army under\nmarching orders, and detaching a brigade immediately this way.\n\n                                             I am, with great regard,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             Alex. Hamilton,\n                                             Aid-de-Camp.\n\nTo Major General Greene.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MISS SCHUYLER.\n\n\n                                                     September 25, 1780.\n\nArnold, hearing of the plot being detected, immediately fled to the\nenemy. I went in pursuit of him, but was much too late; and could\nhardly regret the disappointment, when, on my return, I saw an amiable\nwoman, frantic with distress for the loss of a husband she tenderly\nloved; a traitor to his country and to his fame; a disgrace to his\nconnections: it was the most affecting scene I ever was witness to.\nShe, for a considerable time, entirely lost herself. The General went\nup to see her, and she upbraided him with being in a plot to murder her\nchild. One moment she raved, another she melted into tears. Sometimes\nshe pressed her infant to her bosom, and lamented its fate, occasioned\nby the imprudence of its father, in a manner that would have pierced\ninsensibility itself. All the sweetness of beauty, all the loveliness\nof innocence, all the tenderness of a wife, and all the fondness of a\nmother, showed themselves in her appearance and conduct. We have every\nreason to believe, that she was entirely unacquainted with the plan,\nand that the first knowledge of it, was when Arnold went to tell her\nhe must banish himself from his country and from her for ever. She\ninstantly fell into a convulsion, and he left her in that situation.\n\nThis morning she is more composed. I paid her a visit, and endeavored\nto soothe her by every method in my power; though you may imagine she\nis not easily to be consoled. Added to her other distresses, she is\nvery apprehensive the resentment of her country will fall upon her (who\nis only unfortunate) for the guilt of her husband.\n\nI have tried to persuade her that her fears are ill founded; but she\nwill not be convinced. She received us in bed, with every circumstance\nthat would interest our sympathy: and her sufferings were so eloquent,\nthat I wished myself her brother, to have a right to become her\ndefender. As it is, I have entreated her to enable me to give her\nproofs of my friendship. Could I forgive Arnold for sacrificing his\nhonor, reputation, and duty, I could not forgive him for acting a part\nthat must have forfeited the esteem of so fine a woman. At present she\nalmost forgets his crime in his misfortunes; and her horror at the\nguilt of the traitor, is lost in her love of the man. But a virtuous\nmind cannot long esteem a base one; and time will make her despise if\nit cannot make her hate.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MISS SCHUYLER.\n\n\n                                          Tappan, Oct. 2, 1780.\n\nPoor AndrÃ© suffers to-day. Every thing that is amiable in virtue, in\nfortitude, in delicate sentiment, and accomplished manners, pleads for\nhim: but hard-hearted policy calls for a sacrifice. He must die----. I\nsend you my account of Arnoldâs affair; and to justify myself to your\nsentiments, I must inform you, that I urged a compliance with AndrÃ©âs\nrequest to be shot; and I do not think it would have had an ill effect:\nbut some people are only sensible to motives of policy, and sometimes,\nfrom a narrow disposition, mistake it.\n\nWhen AndrÃ©âs tale comes to be told, and present resentment is over; the\nrefusing him the privilege of choosing the manner of his death will be\nbranded with too much obstinacy.\n\nIt was proposed to me to suggest to him the idea of an exchange for\nArnold; but I knew I should have forfeited his esteem by doing it,\nand therefore declined it. As a man of honor he could not but reject\nit; and I would not for the world have proposed to him a thing which\nmust have placed me in the unamiable light of supposing him capable of\nmeanness, or of not feeling myself the impropriety of the measure. I\nconfess to you, I had the weakness to value the esteem of a dying man,\nbecause I reverenced his merit.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Albany, October 10, 1780.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI am still confined to my room, but believe my disorder has taken a\nfavorable turn, and that I shall soon be tolerably restored.\n\nColonel Van Schaick informs me that he is ordered down with his\nregiment. We are so sadly off here for directors, that I most sincerely\nwish he had been permitted to remain here: his deafness will render him\nlittle serviceable with his regiment.\n\nI am informed that some people have recommended, or intend to\nrecommend, to the General, to evacuate Fort Schuyler. I hope it will\nnot take place, as the enemy would immediately occupy the ground,\nand make it a receptacle for Indians and tories, from whence to pour\ndestruction on the country. A certain Lieutenant Laird, of the militia,\nwho was carried off, or went off voluntarily, with Sir John Johnson,\nwhen last in the country, is returned, and advises that about two\nthousand men were collected at St. Johnâs to make separate attacks on\nthe Grants, Saratoga, and the Mohawk river. If this be true, it was\nprobably intended as a co-operating plan, if Sir Harry had come up the\nriver. An Express is this moment arrived, announcing that about five\nhundred men of the enemy are arrived at the Canajoharie Falls. If this\nshould be confirmed, I shall venture to advise Van Schaick to detain\nhis regiment, and hope it will meet the Generalâs approbation. It is\nsaid the enemy are fortifying at Oswego. I hope the garrison for that\nplace will be speedily sent up.\n\nWhen do you intend to be here? Who will accompany you? Is it probable\nthe General will pay us a visit in winter? I most earnestly wish\nit. Will you make my excuses to the Marquis for my not writing him:\nthe Doctor will not permit me; but what is worse, I really have not\nstrength as yet. Entreat the General to accept of my best wishes: the\nfamily share in them. Adieu, my dear sir.\n\n                                                  I am, affectionately,\n                                                  Yours, etc., etc.,\n                                                  Ph. Schuyler.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ISAAC SEARS.\n\n\n                                      Boston, October 12, 1780.\n\nI was much obliged to you, my dear sir, for the letter which you did me\nthe favor to write me since your return to Boston. I am sorry to find\nthat the same spirit of indifference to public affairs prevails. It is\nnecessary we should rouse, and begin to do our business in earnest, or\nwe shall play a losing game. It is impossible the contest can be much\nlonger supported on the present footing. We must have a Government with\nmore power. We must have a tax in kind. We must have a foreign loan.\nWe must have a Bank, on the true principles of a Bank. We must have\nan Administration distinct from Congress, and in the hands of single\nmen under their orders. We must, above all things, have an army for\nthe war, and an establishment that will interest the officers in the\nservice.\n\nCongress are deliberating on our military affairs: but I apprehend\ntheir resolutions will be tinctured with the old spirit. We seem to be\nproof against experience. They will, however, recommend an army for the\nwar, at least as a primary object. All those who love their country,\nought to exert their influence in the States where they reside, to\ndetermine them to take up this object with energy. The States must sink\nunder the burden of temporary enlistments; and the enemy will conquer\nus by degrees during the intervals of our weakness.\n\nClinton is now said to be making a considerable detachment to the\nsouthward. My fears are high, my hopes low. We are told here, there\nis to be a Congress of the neutral powers at the Hague, for mediating\nof peace. God send it may be true. We want it: but if the idea goes\nabroad, ten to one if we do not fancy the thing done, and fall into a\nprofound sleep till the cannon of the enemy awaken us next campaign.\nThis is our national character.\n\n                                      I am, with great regard, dear Sir,\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\n                                      A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\n\n\n                                                          Oct. 18, 1780.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nSince my last to you, I have had the pleasure of receiving two\nletters from you. I am sorry to find we do not seem to agree in the\nproper remedies to our disorder, at least in the practicability of\napplying those which are proper. Convinced, as I am, of the absolute\ninsufficiency of our present system to our safety, if I do not despair\nof the Republic, it is more the effect of constitution than of judgment.\n\nWith the sentiments I entertain of Gates, I cannot but take pleasure in\nhis removal; and with the confidence I have in Greene, I expect much\nfrom his being the successor; at least, I expect all his circumstances\nwill permit. You seem to have mistaken me on the subject of this\ngentleman. When I spoke of prejudice, I did not suppose it to exist\nwith you, but with Congress as a body; at least with a great part of\nthem. The part they have taken in the affair, in my opinion, does honor\nto their impartiality. I hope they will support the officer appointed\nwith a liberal confidence; his situation surrounded with difficulties\nwill need support. Of your influence for this purpose I am too\nthoroughly persuaded of your patriotism, my dear sir, to doubt.\n\nBe assured, my dear sir, the marks of your regard give me a sincere\npleasure, and I shall be always happy to cultivate it, and to give you\nproofs of my affectionate attachment.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                     Saratoga, Oct. 19th, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor of the 12th inst., I had the pleasure to receive last night.\nMajor Carlton, as you will have heard, has been down to the vicinity\nof this place, at the head of eight hundred British, about two hundred\nenlisted tories, and as many Indians. Fort Ann and Fort George fell\ninto his hands; he burnt Kings and Queensborough townships, and the\nnorth part of this district, to within five miles of my house. The\nthree monthsâ men have evacuated Fort Edward, so that I have nobody\nbetween me and the enemy except two poor families, and about one\nhundred militia with me; on the 17th about one hundred and fifty of the\nenemy burnt Balstown, which lies about twenty miles below me and about\ntwelve miles west of the road leading to Albany; another party is about\neighteen miles east of me, where they have burnt about ten houses. The\nvery valuable settlement of Schoharie, which lays west of Albany, was\nalso entirely consumed on the 17th instant. Thus are we surrounded from\nevery quarter, and the inhabitants flying down the country. I believe\nmy turn will be in a few days, unless troops are sent up. Carlton is at\nTiconderoga and Mount Independence, and waits a reinforcement, which\nis momentarily expected; my informant says he intends a second tour to\ndestroy the settlements on this river, as far as to where the Mohawk\nRiver falls into it, which is about twenty-four miles below this. I\nmost sincerely wish that some continental troops were hastened up for\nthe protection of the county. I entreated Van Schaick to remain.\n\n                                                   P. Schuyler.\n\n  Col. Hamilton, from\n  Genâl Schuyler.\n\n\n\n\n\nHARRISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                       October 27, 1780.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nWe are only leaving Philadelphia. The most flattering attentions have\nbeen paid to Meade and myself, and such as would not permit us to\nprogress before, unless we had shown ourselves entirely disregardless\nof the great world. Besides, motives of a public nature concurred to\nmake us stay thus long. From all I have seen and heard, there is a good\ndisposition in Congress to do all they can for the army and the public\ninterest; and there are many very sensible men among them. In general,\nthey are most warmly attached to the General; and his recommendations\nwill have their weight while the same spirit prevails. It is said there\nhas been infinitely more harmony among them for some time past, than\nhas appeared since the first years of their appointment. I am not,\nhowever, without some apprehension, that if they proceed in the case\nof Lee, etc., the MONSTER (PARTY) may show itself again, and that we may\nhave a second edition of the measures adopted in the instance of Deane.\nOur friends Sullivan and Carroll have been of great service: and\ngentlemen who are, or pretend to be, in the secrets of the cabinet,\nsay they have contributed immeasurably, by their independent conduct,\nto destroy the EASTERN ALLIANCE. Bland is very clever, and without\nquestion wishes to push on in the true and right road. Grayson says\nthis is the best Congress we have had since the first. Our dear Laurens\nrespects many of the members: and General Greeneâs appointment, I\nbelieve, is entirely consonant to the wishes of Congress in general,\nthough we have heard there were members much disposed, if facts had\nnot been so obstinate, to excuse General Gates. The former is here,\nand I suppose will set out in a day or two. Meade and I will serve\nhim all we can. We have done what we could already. Apropos, you\ndelivered him my letter. Our finances are entirely deranged, and there\nis little or no money in the treasury. I believe they are a subject\nof much consideration and puzzlement. The supplies of the army are\nalso matters of present attention, but I donât know what will be\ndone. I hope we shall, by Christmas, have some clothing from the West\nIndies, if the moth have not destroyed it: a quantity, it is said, has\nbeen lying there. It is much to be wished that General Greene were\nat the South. The delegates from that quarter think the situation of\nCornwallis delicate, and that by management, and a proper application\nand use of the force there, the late check given Furguson might be\nimproved into the Earlâs total defeat. This, I fear, is too much even\nto hope. The sending the Baron is considered, as far as I have heard,\nperfectly right, and Leeâs corps give great satisfaction. I am just\nabout to mount my horse, and therefore shall say but little more.\nLaurens will write unto you in a few days, I suppose, and communicate\nany new occurrences. My love to the lads of the family. The same to\nyou. May you be long happy. My most respectful compliments to the\nGeneral.\n\n                                          Most truly and affectionately,\n                                          Rob. H. Harrison.\n\nP. S. The Board have been absolutely too poor to procure parchment for\nthe many promotions that have been required.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                                   1780.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nI shall be obliged to you for the answer to the address, as soon as it\nis convenient to you. If we do not ride to the Point to see the fleet\npass out, I am to have a conference with Count de Rochambeau, and the\nengineer, directly after breakfast, at which I wish you to be present.\n\n                                I am sincerely and affectionately yours,\n                                Geo. Washington.\n\nHalf-past, A. M.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                     November 22d, 1780.\n\nInclosed, my dear Hamilton, I send you a letter for Mr. De Marbois,\nwherein are contained two exemplaires of my dispatches to Doctor\nFranklin. In the hurry of our arrangement, I forgot to mention them\nto the General. Be pleased to give him a summary of their contents,\nto which I have added the southern news of yesterday. Tell him that,\nknowing from experience, how negligent we were in sending accounts to\nEurope, I take upon myself to forward such as may influence mediating\npowers in case of a negotiation.\n\nI have made a calculation about boats, and think that if _we act upon\na large scale_ in the Staten Island expedition, we ought to have\nforty boats--about a thousand (the hundred artillery included) for\nthe watering place and Richmond; your attack should have two hundred.\nIn this calculation I put the staff and other officers, &c., twelve\nhundred men, or thirty per boat, makes forty boats; at least we ought\nnot to have much less.\n\nLet me know, my dear friend, if what we were speaking of last night,\nand the night before last, will be complied with. In consequence of\nwhat was said by the General, I was set at liberty to speak fully to\nG., who was charmed with the beauty and propriety of the thing. I am\nfully, fully of opinion that we would be very sorry not to go (at least\nconditionally), upon that plan, which perhaps will be as easy as any\nthing else: we may even say, il est beau mÃªme dâen tomber. Adieu; write\nme upon what scale, that I may prepare my troops. To-morrow we must\ncarry your private affair. Show me your letter before you give it.\n\n                                                    Yours,\n                                                    La Fayette.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                                      November 22, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time last fall, when I spoke to your Excellency about going to\nthe southward, I explained to you candidly my feelings with respect to\nmilitary reputation; and how much it was my object to act a conspicuous\npart in some enterprise, that might perhaps raise my character as a\nsoldier above mediocrity. You were so good as to say, you would be glad\nto furnish me with an occasion. When the expedition to Staten Island\nwas afoot, a favorable one seemed to offer. There was a battalion\nwithout a field officer, the command of which, I thought, as it\nwas accidental, might be given to me without inconvenience. I made\nan application for it through the Marquis, who informed me of your\nrefusal on two principles: one, that the giving me a whole battalion\nmight be a subject of dissatisfaction; the other, that if any accident\nshould happen to me in the present state of your family, you would be\nembarrassed for the necessary assistance.\n\nThe project you now have in contemplation affords another opportunity.\nI have a variety of reasons, that press me to desire ardently to have\nit in my power to improve it. I take the liberty to observe, that\nthe command may now be proportioned to my rank; and that the second\nobjection ceases to operate, as, during the period of establishing\nour winter quarters, there will be a suspension of material business:\nbesides which, my peculiar situation will, in any case, call me away\nfrom the army in a few days, and Mr. Harrison may be expected back\nearly next month. My command may consist of one hundred and fifty or\ntwo hundred men, composed of fifty men of Major Gibbesâ corps, fifty\nfrom Colonel Meigsâ regiment, and fifty or a hundred more from the\nlight infantry: Major Gibbes to be my Major. The hundred men from here\nmay move on Friday morning towards ----, which will strengthen the\nappearances for Staten Island, to form a junction on the other side of\nthe Passaic. I suggest this mode to avoid the complaints that might\narise from composing my party wholly of the Light Infantry, which might\ngive umbrage to the officers of that corps, who, on this plan, can have\nno just subject for it.\n\nThe primary idea may be, if circumstances permit, to attempt with my\ndetachment Bayardâs Hill. Should we arrive early enough to undertake\nit, I should prefer it to any thing else, both for the brilliancy\nof the attempt in itself, and the decisive consequence of which its\nsuccess would be productive. If we arrive too late to make this\neligible (as there is reason to apprehend), my corps may form the van\nof one of the other attacks, and Bayardâs Hill will be a pretext for\nmy being employed in the affair, on a supposition of my knowing the\nground, which is partly true. I flatter myself, also, that my military\ncharacter stands so well in the army, as to reconcile the officers, in\ngeneral, to the measure. All circumstances considered, I venture to\nsay, any exceptions which might be taken, would be unreasonable.\n\nI take this method of making the request, to avoid the embarrassment\nof a personal explanation. I shall only add, that however much I have\nthe matter at heart, I wish your Excellency entirely to consult your\nown inclination, and not, from a disposition to oblige me, to do any\nthing that may be disagreeable to you. It will, nevertheless, make me\nsingularly happy if your wishes correspond with mine.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                    Paramus, November 28, 1780.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nHere I arrived last night, and am going to set out for Philadelphia.\nGouvion goes straight to New Windsor, and by him I write to the\nGeneral. I speak of Hand and Smith, whom I recommend, and add: âIf,\nhowever, you were to cast your eye on a man, who, I think, would suit\nbetter than any other in the world, Hamilton is, I confess, the officer\nwhom I would like best to see in my * * * * *.â Then I go on with the\nidea, that, at equal advantages, you deserve from him the preference;\nthat your advantages are the greatest; I speak of a co-operation;\nof your being in the family; and conclude, that on every public and\nprivate account I advise him to take you.\n\nI know the Generalâs friendship and gratitude for you, my dear\nHamilton: both are greater than you perhaps imagine. I am sure he needs\nonly to be told that something will suit you, and when he thinks he\ncan do it he certainly will. Before this campaign I was your friend,\nand very intimate friend, agreeably to the ideas of the world. Since\nmy second voyage, my sentiment has increased to such a point the world\nknows nothing about. To show _both_, from want and from scorn of\nexpressions, I shall only tell you--Adieu.\n\n                                                    Yours,\n                                                    La Fayette.\n\n\n\n\nDE CORNY TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Newport, 4th Dec., 1780.\n\nSir:\n\nThe ill state of my health obliges me to request permission to\nreturn to France, for as short a time as possible. I must, before my\ndeparture, acquit myself of the double duty of thanking you for the\nfavors with which you have honored me, and of soliciting your orders\nfor my country. The satisfaction I feel of being chosen to accompany\nthe Marquis de la Fayette, and of executing under his orders, the\ndispositions necessary to the arrival of the French army, which, as\nan interesting period of my life, will not be superior to that of\nreturning to give our great and good General Washington new proofs of\nmy zeal. I shall always be honored in being reckoned one of your most\nfaithful comrades. I wish that happiness, success and glory follow you\nfor ever.\n\n                             I am, with everlasting attachment,\n                             Your most humble and most obedient servant,\n                             Estris de Corny,\n                             Lt. Colonel of Cavalry.\n\nI pray you to present my friendship and full compliments to the\nGeneralâs family.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nDU PORTAIL TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                                   1780.\n\nJe vous prie, mon cher Colonel, de lire les papiers ci-joints, ils vous\nmettront au fait de ce dont il sâagit. Nous avons dÃ©jÃ  parlÃ© ensemble\nde cet objet, ainsi il est inutile dây revenir, il est certain que\nsi Son Excellence ne vous favorit point dans ces occasions, il nous\nest absolument impossible pour nous mÃªmes de nous tirer dâembarras.\nLâhomme dont il est question, et qui est celui qui vous remettra cette\nlettre, sert lui-mÃªme Ã  prouver le peu de ressources que nous avons\ndans ce genre. M. de Vellefranche en avait Ã©tÃ© si mÃ©content la campagne\nderniÃ¨re, quâil lâavait renvoyÃ©, et nâen voulait plus entendre parler.\nLâimpossibilitÃ© dâen trouver un autre le force de le reprendre; il\nne demande pas mieux assurÃ©ment que de le changer, il fait tous ses\nefforts pour cela, il frappe Ã  toutes les portes, mais inutilement.\n\nIl est bien aisÃ© de faire de belles loix pour corriger les abus; tout\nle monde voit les abus, tout le monde peut se faire valoir en dÃ©clamant\ndâautre, mais dÃ©terminer, presque les circonstances permettent, de\ncorriger lâabus, en supprimant des moyens abusifs de faire une chose en\nsubstituer dâautres voilÃ  ce que les RÃ©formateurs Croyans ne font pas\ntoujours.\n\nVous expliquerez cela Ã  qui il appartient, probablement vous ne vous\ntromperez pas, au fait dont je vous prie de donner Ã  M. de Villefranche\nun mot comme vous lâavez donnÃ© Ã  M. de Rochefontaine.\n\nJe suis, mon cher Colonel, dans une totale dÃ©faute de livres anglais;\njâen ai rÃ©luquÃ© un sur la table aujourdâhui, que le Colonel Harrison\nmâa dit que vous lisiez, mais je pense que vous ne lisez pas les deux\nvolumes Ã  la fois. Si vous pouviez mâen prÃªter un, vous obligeriez\nbeaucoup votre trÃ¨s humble serviteur.\n\n                                                    Du Portail.\n\nJe vous prie de me renvoyer les papiers en cachets.\n\n                                                    Du Portail.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                    Philadelphia, Dec. 9, 1780.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nOn my arrival at Paramus, I wrote a letter to the General, which\nColonel Gouvion was to deliver to himself at New Windsor; so that more\nexpedition had been made than you had thought. But the General having\nunfortunately altered his mind, and taken the road to Morristown,\nanother misfortune threw Hand in his way; and remembering your advice\non the occasion, he hastened to make him the proposition, and in\nconsequence of it wrote his letter to Congress. From Paramus I went\nmyself to the Lots, and from thence to Morristown, where I met the\nGeneral; and knowing that my letter could not reach him under some\ndays, I became regardless of your wishes, and made a verbal application\nin my own name, and about the same time that had been settled between\nus. I canât express to you, my dear friend, how sorry and disappointed\nI felt, when I knew from him, the General, that (greatly in consequence\nof your advice) he had settled the whole matter with Hand, and written\nfor him to Congress. I confess I became warmer on the occasion than\nyou would perhaps have wished me to be; and I wanted the General to\nallow my sending an express, who would have overtaken the letter, as it\nwas in the hands of General St. Clair: but the General did not think it\nto be a convenient measure; and, I confess, I may have been a little\nblinded on its propriety. I took care not to compromise you in this\naffair, when the General expressed a desire to serve you, and in a\nmanner you would have been satisfied with. Now for the voyage to France.\n\nCongress seem resolved that an _Envoy be sent in the way you wish_, and\nthis was yesterday determined in the House. Next Monday the gentleman\nwill be elected. I have already spoken to many members. I know of a\nnumber of voices that will be for you. This day, and that of to-morrow,\nwill be by me employed in paying visits. As soon as the business is\nfixed upon, I shall send you an express. I think you ought to hold\nyourself in readiness, and in case you are called for, come with all\npossible speed; for you must go immediately, that you may have returned\nbefore the beginning of operations. If you go, my dear sir, I shall\ngive you all public or private knowledge about Europe I am possessed\nof. Besides many private letters, that may introduce you to my friends,\nI intend giving you the _key_ of the cabinet, as well as of the\nsocieties which influence them. In a word, my good friend, any thing in\nmy power shall be entirely yours.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                          Albany, Dec. 9, 1780.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Rensselaer, who has the direction of the Armory here, tells me that\nthe Board of War write him, they are unable to support it any longer\non the present establishment for want of supplies, and propose to him\nto endeavor to have it carried on by contract. This he declares is\nimpossible. The Armory must either continue on the present footing\nor cease. As far as I understand the matter, there is no objection\nto the terms in themselves, but a want of means to comply with them.\nIf there is a want of means, the thing must be relinquished; but as\nit does not strike me that it can be more difficult to maintain an\nArmory here than elsewhere; and as I apprehend, in the present state\nof Arsenals, we shall stand in need of all the repairing we can do; I\ntake the liberty, at Mr. Rensselaerâs request, to mention the matter\nto you. I have seen the Armory myself. It appears to be in excellent\norder, and under a very ingenious and industrious man. I am told it\nhas been conducted hitherto with great activity. Its situation is, in\nmy opinion, advantageous. As there is a considerable body of troops\nalways at West Point, and the army generally in its vicinity, the river\nis very convenient for transportation to and from the Armory; and, I\nshould think, would be conducive to economy. This consideration strikes\nme as of importance. General Knox, however, will be the best judge of\nthe usefulness of this Armory.\n\nMr. Rensselaer also mentions a considerable number of hides in the\nhands of persons here who had had orders from the Clothier-General not\nto dispose of them but by his order. He says he can no longer, but with\ngreat difficulty, procure leather for the public works on credit; and\nhas requested me to mention this also to your Excellency.\n\nMrs. Hamilton presents her respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington\nand yourself. After the holidays we shall be at head quarters.\n\nI believe I imparted to you General Schuylerâs wish that you could make\nit convenient to pay a visit with Mrs. Washington this winter. He and\nMrs. Schuyler have several times repeated their inquiries and wishes. I\nhave told them I was afraid your business would not permit you: if it\nshould I shall be happy. You will enable me to let them know about what\nperiod it will suit. When the sleighing arrives, it will be an affair\nof two days up and two days down.\n\n                                                   I have, etc.,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                    New-Windsor, Dec. 27, 1780.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nYour letter of the 19th came safe by the Doctor, who set out this\nmorning for Philadelphia.\n\nI had, previous to the receipt of it, and without knowledge that the\nBoard of War had given any direction respecting the Armory at Albany,\nrequested the Governor to exempt (if he could do so with propriety) the\ncitizens who were employed in it, from military services in case of\nalarm; and had written to General Clinton to direct the Quarter-Master\nto afford every assistance in his power to have the work repaired, and\nthe business, as far as depended upon him, accelerated. I have now\ngiven order for delivery of such hides as Mr. Rensselaer shall find\n_absolutely_ necessary for the use of the Armory.\n\nAlthough a trip to Albany, on more accounts than one, would be\nperfectly agreeable to my wishes, I am so far from having it in my\npower, at this time, to fix a period for this gratification of them,\nthat I have but small hope of accomplishing it at all this winter.\nThere are some matters in suspense which may make a journey to Rhode\nIsland necessary; but as the subject is not fit for a letter, I shall\nwithhold the communication till I see you.\n\nA second embarkation has taken place at New-York. The strength of the\ndetachment, or its destination, are vaguely reported; and no certainty\nunder whose command it goes. Arnold is said to be of it; from whence\nthe connections conclude that New-Haven or New-London must infallibly\nbe the object, while more rational conjecturers send it to the\nsouthward, from whence no late accounts have been received.\n\nMrs. Washington most cordially joins me in compliments of\ncongratulation to Mrs. Hamilton and yourself, on the late happy event\nof your marriage, and in wishes to see you both at head quarters. We\nbeg of you to present our respectful compliments to General Schuyler,\nhis lady and family, and offer them strong assurances of the pleasure\nwe should feel at seeing them at New-Windsor.\n\n                             With much truth, and great personal regard,\n                             I am, dear Hamilton,\n                             Your affectionate friend and servant,\n                             G. Washington.\n\n\n\n\nGREENE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                       January 10, 1781.\n\nMy Dear Colonel:\n\nGeneral Du Portail being on his way to the northward, gives me an\nopportunity to write you, which I should have done before, had not my\nletters to His Excellency contained as full information of the state of\nthings as I was able to give, from the little time I had been in the\ndepartment.\n\nWhen I was appointed to this command, I expected to meet with many\nnew and singular difficulties; but they infinitely exceed what I\napprehended. This is really carrying on a war in an enemyâs country;\nfor you cannot establish the most inconsiderable magazine, or convey\nthe smallest quantity of stores from one post to another, without\nbeing obliged to detach guards for their security. The division among\nthe people is much greater than I imagined; and the whigs and tories\npersecute each other with little less than savage fury. There is\nnothing but murders and devastations in every quarter.\n\nThe loss of our army at Charleston, and the defeat of General Gates,\nhas been the cause of keeping such shoals of militia on foot; and their\nservice has been accompanied with such destruction and loss, as has\nalmost laid waste the whole country. Nothing has been more destructive\nto the true interest of this country than the mode adopted for its\ndefence. Two misfortunes happening one after the other, may have\nrendered it unavoidable the last season; but should it be continued,\nthe inhabitants are inevitably ruined, and the resources of the country\nrendered incapable of affording support to an army competent to\nits defence. Government here is infinitely more popular than to the\nnorthward; and there is no such thing as national character or national\nsentiment. The inhabitants are from all quarters of the globe, and as\nvarious in their opinions, projects, and schemes, as their manners and\nhabits are from their early education. Those in office, from a vanity\nto be thought powerful, join in the measure of imposing upon the public\nrespecting the strength and resources of these southern States: and\nwhile Congress, and the minister of France, are kept under this fatal\ndelusion, I fear little support will be given to this department. The\ninhabitants are numerous; but they would be rather formidable abroad\nthan at home. They are scattered over such a vast extent of country,\nthat it is difficult to collect, and still more difficult to subsist\nthem. There is a great spirit of enterprise among the black people; and\nthose that come out as volunteers are not a little formidable to the\nenemy. There are, also, some particular corps under Sumpter, Marion,\nand Clarke, that are bold and daring; the rest of the militia are\nbetter calculated to destroy provisions than oppose the enemy.\n\nAt Philadelphia, and all my journey through the country, I endeavored\nto impress upon those in power, the necessity of sending clothing, and\nsupplies of every kind, immediately to this army. But poverty was urged\nas a plea, in bar to every application. They all promised fair, but I\nfear will do but little: ability is wanting with some, and inclination\nwith others.\n\nPublic credit is so totally lost, that private people will not give\ntheir aid, though they see themselves involved in one common ruin.\nIt is my opinion that General Washingtonâs influence will do more\nthan all the assemblies upon the continent. I always thought him\nexceeding popular; but in many places he is little less than adored,\nand universally admired. His influence in this country might possibly\neffect something great. However, I found myself exceedingly well\nreceived, but more from being the friend of the General, than from my\nown merit.\n\nThis country wants, for its defence, a small but well appointed army,\norganized so as to move with great celerity. It should consist of\nabout five thousand infantry, and from eight hundred to a thousand\nhorse. The enemy cannot maintain a larger force in this quarter,\nneither can we. The resources from the country are too small to subsist\na large body of troops at any one point: and to draw supplies from a\ndistance, through such long tracts of barren land, will be next to\nimpossible, unless the business can be aided by a water transportation;\nand, in either case, it will be accompanied with an amazing expense.\nCould we get a superiority of horse, we could soon render it difficult\nfor Lord Cornwallis to hold his position so far in the country. Nor\nshould I be under any apprehensions, with a much inferior force to\nhis, of taking post near him, if I had but such a body of horse. But\nthe enemyâs horse is so much superior to ours, that we cannot move a\ndetachment towards them without hazarding its ruin.\n\nWhen I came to the army, I found it in a most wretched condition. The\nofficers had lost all confidence in the General, and the troops all\ntheir discipline. The troops had not only lost their discipline, but\nthey were so addicted to plundering that they were a terror to the\ncountry. The General and I met at least upon very civil terms; and he\nexpressed the greatest happiness at my being appointed to succeed him.\n\nGeneral Smallwood and he were not upon good terms; the former suspected\nthe latter of having an intention to supplant him, but many think\nwithout reason. Others, again, are of opinion, his suspicions were well\nfounded, and that Smallwood was not a little mortified at my being\nappointed to this department, and got outrageous when he heard Baron\nSteuben was coming also. How the matter was, I know not; certain it\nis, he is gone home, having refused to act under Baron Steuben, and\ndeclares he will not serve at all, unless Congress will give him a\ncommission, dated at least two years before his appointment. This, I\nthink, can never happen, notwithstanding his private merit, and the\nclaim of the State. The battle of Camden here is represented widely\ndifferent from what it is to the northward.\n\nColonel Williams thinks that none of the general officers were entitled\nto any extraordinary merit. The action was short, and succeeded by a\nflight, wherein every body took care of himself, as well officers\nas soldiers. Not an officer, except Major Anderson, and one or two\nCaptains, that brought off the field of battle a single soldier. The\nColonel also says, that General Gates would have shared little more\ndisgrace than is the common lot of the unfortunate, notwithstanding he\nwas early off, if he had only halted at the Waxhaws or Charlotte--the\nfirst about sixty, and the last about eighty miles from the field of\nbattle. What little incidents either give or destroy reputation! How\nmany long hours a man may labor with an honest zeal in his countryâs\nservice, and be disgraced for the most trifling error either in conduct\nor opinion! Hume very justly observes, no man will have reputation\nunless he is useful to society, be his merit or abilities what they\nmay. Therefore, it is necessary for a man to be fortunate, as well as\nwise and just. The greater part of the loss of the Maryland line, in\nthe action of Camden, happened after they began to retreat: indeed,\nthis was the case with all the troops. What gave Smallwood such great\nreputation, was his halt at Salisbury, which was nothing but accident.\nYou know there are great parties prevailing in the Maryland line; and\nperhaps his merit is not a little diminished on that account. I think\nhim a brave and good officer, but too slow to effect any thing great\nin a department like this, where embarrassments are without number,\nand where nothing can be effected without the greatest promptitude and\ndecision. This army is in such a wretched condition that I hardly know\nwhat to do with it. The officers have got such a habit of negligence,\nand the soldiers so loose and disorderly, that it is next to impossible\nto give it a military complexion. Without clothing, I am sure I shall\nnever do it. I call no councils of war, and I communicate my intentions\nto very few. The army was posted at Charlotte when I came up with\nit; and in a council it had been determined to winter there; but the\ndifficulty of procuring subsistence, and other reasons, induced me not\nonly to take a new position, but to make an entire new disposition.\nAll this I effected by a single order, having first made the necessary\ninquiry respecting the new positions, by sending a man to examine\nthe grounds and other requisites. If I cannot inspire the army with\nconfidence and respect by an independent conduct, I foresee it will\nbe impossible to instil discipline and order among the troops. General\nLeslie has arrived, and joined Lord Cornwallis, whose force now is more\nthan three times larger than ours. And we are subsisting ourselves by\nour own industry; and I am not without hopes of forming something like\na magazine. I am laboring also to get clothing from every quarter.\nBaron Steuben is in Virginia, and is indefatigable in equipping and\nforwarding the troops from that State. I left General Guest in Maryland\nfor the same purpose; but I have got nothing from there yet, nor do\nI expect much for months to come. The North Carolina State have such\na high opinion of the militia, that I donât expect they will ever\nattempt to raise a single continental soldier; notwithstanding the most\nsensible among them will acknowledge the folly of employing militia.\n\nBut I must have tried your patience, and therefore will make a full\nstop concerning matters in this department, and inquire how you go on\nto the northward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI beg my compliments to General Washingtonâs family, to General Knox\nand his family, and all other of my acquaintances.\n\nI shall be exceedingly obliged to you if you will communicate to me,\nwith great freedom, every thing worthy of note that is said or respects\nthis department.\n\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\n                                                   N. Greene.\n\nTo Col. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nMEADE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                       January 13, 1781.\n\nWhat shall I say, or think, of my dear friend Hamilton? Not a single\nline from him since we parted. I will not, however, charge you, my dear\nfellow, with not having done your duty, or, at least, of a want of\ninclination to do it: you may have complied fully with your promise,\nand your letters miscarried: mine probably have shared the same fate.\nThis is the third since I got home. The first was writ shortly after\nGeneral Greeneâs arrival at Richmond, and committed to his care; the\nsecond, telling you I was married, had not so favorable a prospect of\nconveyance; and this must take its chance.\n\nArnold, you knew, was coming here. He has really been here, and, with\nshame be it said, marched twenty-five miles, and back, without having\na single musket fired at him: but let me observe, in justice to the\npeople at large, that there are fewer disaffected by far, in this\nState, than any other in the Union; and that the people turn out with\nthe utmost cheerfulness. The misfortune, on the present invasion, was,\nthat in the confusion the arms were sent every where, and no timely\nplan laid to put them into the hands of the men who were assembling.\nThe Baron has, no doubt, given the General the particulars of the\nwhole affair. Should he not have done it, I must refer you for them to\nRivingtonâs paper: he can hardly be himself, and say any thing on the\nsubject that ought not to be credited. The damage, however, done by the\nenemy is not considerable, and much less than might have been expected\nfrom them. My friends have suffered. I have often felt much pain, my\ndear Hamilton, at scenes of the kind to the northward, but never in\nso great a degree as on this occasion. The nearest and dearest to me\nwere within reach of the enemy; wife, mother, brother, sister; and all\nhave shared deeply in the distress; and, indeed, many of them were in\npersonal danger, and my best friend of the number; myself of course\nsomewhat exposed. You possess a heart that can feel for me; you have a\nfemale, too, that you love. * * * * * After placing her, with at least\ntwenty other females and children, at a safe distance, I immediately\nreturned, and joined the Baron about the time the enemy left Richmond,\nin order to render him all the aid I could, being intimately acquainted\nwith the country for many miles in the vicinity of the enemy: and\non their return down the river, I left him to go in pursuit of a\nresidence for a favorite brother who was driven from his home, and\nobliged to attend to his wife and a family of little children.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis gives me an opening to speak of my return to the army. I have been\nlong wishing your advice in full on the occasion. You are acquainted\nwith the arguments I have used in favor of my stay here. * * * * * I\nhave not, however, as yet, thrown off the uniform, but I am inclined to\nbelieve it must be the case. If we meet not again, my dear Hamilton, as\nbrother aids, I still flatter myself that, in the course of time, we\nshall meet as the sincerest of friends. If you have not already writ to\nme, my dear fellow, let me entreat you, when you go about it, to fill\na sheet in close hand. Say all about yourself first, and next, what\nmay be most interesting and new to me, for I have not heard a syllable\nfrom camp since I left it. I wrote to the âOld Secretaryâ while he was\nin Virginia, but could not hear from him. Tell him that I suffered\nnot a little on his account, for I conceived, for a long time, that\nhis cousinâs unlucky fall from his horse had happened to him: such an\nopinion had like to have carried me to Alexandria.\n\nI am under the necessity of concluding, but first let me present my\nrespects to the General and Mrs. Washington, my sincerest esteem to\nthe lads of the family, and every officer of the army whom you know I\nregard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                                   Your sincere friend,\n                                                   R. R. Meade.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Albany, January 25, 1781.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYesterday I received your favor of the sixteenth instant. It affords\nme pleasure to learn that the Pennsylvania line is reduced to order;\nbut we in this quarter are on the point of experiencing a similar\ncommotion. Two regiments threaten to march to head quarters, unless\nsome money is paid them, the certificates for the depreciation\nexpedited, and, in future, better supplied with provisions. Yesterday,\nabout three thousand bushels of wheat, six hundred pounds worth of beef\nand three or four thousand dollars, were subscribed. I am in hopes\nwe shall procure what will afford each man about ten dollars; and I\nhave some hopes that this, with a little management, will render them\ntolerably quiet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEntreat the General and his lady to accept my best wishes. Do not\nforget to remember me to Colonels Harrison and Tilghman. Adieu.\n\n                                                  I am, dear Sir,\n                                                  Most affectionately,\n                                                  Yours, etc., etc.,\n                                                  Ph: Schuyler.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Albany, February 5, 1781.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe plan you mention for supplying the armies in America, I should\nbe exceedingly happy to see attempted; but I fear Congress will not\nventure on it, although they should be convinced of its eligibility.\nIn the course of last year, I proposed it repeatedly to individual\nmembers, who generally approved, and once or twice took occasion to\nmention it in Congress; but in the House no one dared to give his\nopinion. I am persuaded, if it was adopted, that a saving, at present\nalmost inconceivable, would be induced, and an order and economy in the\npublic expenditures, which, whilst it would reconcile the minds of men\nto bear the public burthens with alacrity, would effectually eradicate\nthe fears which too generally prevail, that we shall sink under the\nenormous weight of our expenses. * * *\n\n                                                  I am, my dear Sir,\n                                                  Very affectionately,\n                                                  Yours, etc., etc.,\n                                                  Ph: Schuyler.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO SCHUYLER.\n\n\n                 Head Quarters, New Windsor, February 18, 1781.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nSince I had the pleasure of writing you last, an unexpected change\nhas taken place in my situation. I am no longer a member of the\nGeneralâs family. This information will surprise you, and the manner\nof the change will surprise you more. Two days ago, the General and\nI passed each other on the stairs. He told me he wanted to speak to\nme. I answered that I would wait upon him immediately. I went below,\nand delivered Mr. Tilghman a letter to be sent to the commissary,\ncontaining an order of a pressing and interesting nature.\n\nReturning to the General, I was stopped on the way by the Marquis de\nLa Fayette, and we conversed together about a minute on a matter of\nbusiness. He can testify how impatient I was to get back, and that\nI left him in a manner which, but for our intimacy, would have been\nmore than abrupt. Instead of finding the General, as is usual, in his\nroom, I met him at the head of the stairs, where, accosting me in an\nangry tone, âColonel Hamilton,â said he, âyou have kept me waiting\nat the head of the stairs these ten minutes. I must tell you, sir,\nyou treat me with disrespect.â I replied, without petulancy, but with\ndecision, âI am not conscious of it, sir; but since you have thought\nit necessary to tell me so, we part.â âVery well, sir,â said he, âif\nit be your choice,â or something to this effect, and we separated.\nI sincerely believe my absence, which gave so much umbrage, did\nnot last two minutes. In less than an hour after, Tilghman came to\nme in the Generalâs name, assuring me of his great confidence in my\nabilities, integrity, usefulness, etc.; and of his desire, in a candid\nconversation, to heal a difference which could not have happened but in\na moment of passion. I requested Mr. Tilghman to tell him--1st. That I\nhad taken my resolution in a manner not to be revoked. 2d. That, as a\nconversation could serve no other purpose than to produce explanations,\nmutually disagreeable, though I certainly would not refuse an interview\nif he desired it, yet I would be happy if he would permit me to decline\nit. 3d. That though determined to leave the family, the same principles\nwhich had kept me so long in it, would continue to direct my conduct\ntowards him when out of it. 4th. That, however, I did not wish to\ndistress him, or the public business, by quitting him before he could\nderive other assistance by the return of some of the gentlemen who were\nabsent. 5th. And that, in the mean time, it depended on him, to let\nour behavior to each other be the same as if nothing had happened. He\nconsented to decline the conversation, and thanked me for my offer of\ncontinuing my aid in the manner I had mentioned.\n\nI have given you so particular a detail of our difference, from the\ndesire I have to justify myself in your opinion. Perhaps you may think\nI was precipitate in rejecting the overture made by the General to an\naccommodation. I must assure you, my dear sir, it was not the effect of\nresentment: it was the deliberate result of maxims I had long formed\nfor the government of my own conduct.\n\nI always disliked the office of an aid-de-camp, as having in it a\nkind of personal dependence. I refused to serve in this capacity with\ntwo Major-Generals, at an early period of the war. Infected, however,\nwith the enthusiasm of the times, an idea of the Generalâs character\novercame my scruples, and induced me to accept his invitation to enter\ninto his family * * *. It has been often with great difficulty that I\nhave prevailed upon myself not to renounce it; but while, from motives\nof public utility, I was doing violence to my feelings, I was always\ndetermined, if there should ever happen a breach between us, never to\nconsent to an accommodation. I was persuaded, that when once that nice\nbarrier, which marked the boundaries of what we owed to each other,\nshould be thrown down, it might be propped again, but could never be\nrestored.\n\nThe General is a very honest man. His competitors have slender\nabilities, and less integrity. His popularity has often been essential\nto the safety of America, and is still of great importance to it. These\nconsiderations have influenced my past conduct respecting him, and will\ninfluence my future. I think it is necessary he should be supported.\n\nHis estimation in your mind, whatever may be its amount, I am persuaded\nhas been formed on principles, which a circumstance like this cannot\nmaterially effect: but if I thought it could diminish your friendship\nfor him, I should almost forego the motives that urge me to justify\nmyself to you. I wish what I have said, to make no other impression\nthan to satisfy you I have not been in the wrong. It is also said in\nconfidence, as a public knowledge of the breach would, in many ways,\nhave an ill effect. It will probably be the policy of both sides to\nconceal it, and cover the separation with some plausible pretext. I am\nimportuned by such of my friends as are privy to the affair, to listen\nto a reconciliation; but my resolution is unalterable.\n\nAs I cannot think of quitting the army during the war, I have a project\nof re-entering into the artillery, by taking Lieutenant-Colonel\nForrestâs place, who is desirous of retiring on half-pay. I have not,\nhowever, made up my mind upon this head, as I should be obliged to come\nin the youngest Lieutenant-Colonel instead of the eldest, which I ought\nto have been by natural succession, had I remained in the corps; and,\nat the same time, to resume studies relative to the profession, which,\nto avoid inferiority, must be laborious.\n\nIf a handsome command in the campaign in the light infantry should\noffer itself, I shall balance between this and the artillery. My\nsituation in the latter would be more solid and permanent; but as I\nhope the war will not last long enough to make it progressive, this\nconsideration has the less force. A command for the campaign, would\nleave me the winter to prosecute studies relative to my future career\nin life * * *. I have written to you on this subject with all the\nfreedom and confidence to which you have a right, and with an assurance\nof the interest you take in all that concerns me.\n\n                                      Very sincerely and affectionately,\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\n                                      A. Hamilton.\n\nGeneral Schuyler.\n\n\n\n\nLAURENS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                                   1781.\n\nI am indebted to you, my dear Hamilton, for two letters; the first\nfrom Albany, as masterly a piece of cynicism as ever was penned; the\nother from Philadelphia, dated the second March: in both, you mention\na design of retiring, which makes me exceedingly unhappy. I would not\nwish to have you, for a moment, withdrawn from the public service: at\nthe same time, my friendship for you, and knowledge of your value to\nthe United States, make me most ardently desire, that you should fill\nonly the first offices of the Republic. I was flattered with an account\nof your being elected a delegate from New-York, and am much mortified\nnot to hear it confirmed by yourself. I must confess to you, that, at\nthe present stage of the war, I should prefer your going into Congress,\nand from thence becoming a minister plenipotentiary for peace, to your\nremaining in the army, where the dull system of seniority, and the\n_tableau_, would prevent you from having the important commands to\nwhich you are entitled: but at any rate I will not have you renounce\nyour rank in the army, unless you entered the career above mentioned.\nYour private affairs cannot require such immediate and close attention.\nYou speak like a _paterfamilias_ surrounded with a numerous progeny.\n\nI had, in fact, resumed the black project, as you were informed,\nand urged the matter very strenuously, both to our privy council\nand legislative body; but I was out-voted, having only reason on my\nside, and being opposed by a triple-headed monster, that shed the\nbaneful influence of avarice, prejudice, and pusillanimity, in all\nour assemblies. It was some consolation to me, however, to find that\nphilosophy and truth had made some little progress since my last\neffort, as I obtained twice as many suffrages as before.\n\n\n\n\nDUKE DE LAUZUN TO HAMILTON.\n\n                                A Lebanon, le 26 FÃ©vrier, 1781.\n\nPermettez moi, Monsieur, de vous adresser une lettre pour le Marquis\nde Lafayette, ne sachant oÃ¹ il est. Je ne veux point importuner son\nExcellence dans un moment oÃ¹ tant dâaffaires lâaccablent. M. de Closen,\nAide-de-Camp de M. le Comte de Rochambeau, lui porte des dÃ©pÃªches\nimportantes; M. le Marquis de Laval paraÃ®t destinÃ© Ã  commander un\ndÃ©tachement de Grenadiers, et chasseurs de lâArmÃ©e FranÃ§aise. Je vous\nsupplie de vouloir bien rappeler au GÃ©nÃ©ral, que de quelque maniere\nquâil me juge utile, je me trouverai heureux dâÃªtre employÃ©, et quâil\nveuille bien tÃ©moigner Ã  M. de Rochambeau que ce choix ne lui sera pas\ndÃ©sagrÃ©able.\n\nRecevez les excuses de mon ImportunitÃ©, et les assurances de tous les\nsentiments dâestime et de considÃ©ration, avec lesquels jâai lâhonneur\ndâÃªtre, Monsieur, votre trÃ¨s humble et trÃ¨s obÃ©issant serviteur.\n\n                                                     De Lauzun.\n\n\n\n\nHARRISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   New Windsor, March 26, 1781.\n\nI came here, my dear Hamilton, on Friday night, to bid adieu to the\nGeneral, to you, and to my other friends, as a military man, and regret\nmuch that I have not had the happiness of seeing you. To-morrow I am\nobliged to depart; and it is possible our separation may be for ever.\nBut be this as it may, it can only be with respect to our persons; for\nas to affection, mine for you will continue to my latest breath. This\nevent will probably surprise you; but from your knowledge of me, I rely\nyou will conclude, at the instant, that no light considerations would\nhave taken me from the army; and I think I might safely have rested the\nmatter here. However, as the friendship between us gives you a claim\nto something more, and as I am not indifferent about character, and\nshall be anxious to have the esteem of all who are good, and virtuously\ngreat, I shall detail to you, my friend, the more substantial reasons\nwhich have led to my present conduct. I go from the army, then, because\nI have found, on examination, that my little fortune, earned by an\nhonest and hard industry, was becoming embarrassed--to attend to the\neducation of my children--to provide, if possible, for the payment of\na considerable sum of sterling money and interest, with which I stand\ncharged, on account of the land I lately received from my honored\nfather, for equality of partition between myself and two brothers--to\nsave a house which he had begun, and which, without instant attention,\nwould be ruined, or at least greatly injured--to provide, if possible,\nfor the payment of goods, which far exceed any profits I can make from\nmy estate--and because the State of Maryland, in a flattering manner,\nhave been pleased to appoint me to a place, very respectable in its\nnature, corresponding with my former, and very interesting to my\nwhole future life and support. They have appointed me to the Chair of\ntheir Supreme Court. These, my friend, are the motives to my present\nresolution. My own feelings are satisfied on the occasion, though\nI cannot but regret parting with the most valuable acquaintances I\nhave; and I hope they will justify me most fully to you, my Hamilton,\nespecially when you consider, besides, the time I have been in service,\nand the compensation I have received. I wish, seriously, I had been\nsooner apprised of the good intentions of the State towards me, for\nreasons which will occur to you. They were but very lately known, and\nI was no sooner possessed of them, than I communicated the matter (that\nI should leave the army) to the General--having found, on inquiry,\nit was only in my power to accept the offer of the Chair, or decline\nit for ever, as the filling it had become a measure of immediate\nnecessity; and there were other gentlemen, both of ability and merit,\nwho had been mentioned for it, and who would probably have willingly\naccepted it. You are now to pardon me for this long relation, so very\npersonal. You must do it, as what I owed to your friendship produced\nit, and as it is my hope and wish to stand fair in your opinion and\nesteem.\n\nI proceed to tell you that I live in Charles County, Maryland, where\nI should be peculiarly happy to see you: but as I can have but little\nhopes of being gratified in this, let me have the next pleasure to\nit, the favor of a letter now and then; in which, write of matters\npersonally interesting to yourself, as they will be so to me. Present\nme most respectfully to your lady, to General and Mrs. Schuyler. My\nbest wishes attend you all. Adieu.\n\n                                    Yours in haste, most affectionately,\n                                    Robt. H. Harrison.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                           Elk, April 10, 1781.\n\nWhere is, for the present, my dear Hamilton? This question is not a\nmere affair of curiosity. It is not even wholly owing to the tender\nsentiments of my friendship. But motives both of a public and private\nnature conspire in making me wish that your woe be not accomplished.\nPerhaps you are at head quarters--perhaps at Albany; at all events,\nIâll tell you my history. Had the French fleet come in, Arnold was\nours. The more certain it was, the greater my disappointment has been;\nat last it has become necessary for them to return to Rhode Island. I\nthink they have exerted themselves for the common good, and this has\nbeen a comfort in our misfortune.\n\nHaving luckily arrived at Elk by water, which at first I had no right\nto expect, I have received the Generalâs letters. If you are at head\nquarters, you will have seen my correspondence with the General; if\nnot, I tell you that I am ordered to the southern army, and the General\nthinks that the army under his immediate command will remain inactive.\nAfter a march of forty days, we will arrive at a time when the heat\nof the season will put an end to operations. This detachment is so\ncircumstanced as to make it very inconvenient for officers and men to\nproceed. Before we arrive, we shall perhaps be reduced to five or six\nhundred men. There will be no light infantry formed--no attack against\nNew-York--none of those things which had flattered my mind. If a corps\nis sent to the southward by land, it ought to have been the Jersey\nline, because if we weaken ourselves, New-York will be out of the\nquestion.\n\nMonsieur Destouches will, I think, propose to the General to send to\nPhiladelphia lâEveillÃ© and all the frigates; these, with the frigates\nnow at Philadelphia, would carry fifteen hundred men to whatever\npart of the continent the General would think proper. We could then\ngo to Morristown, there to form a new corps of light infantry upon\nthe principles at first intended, and embarking in the first days of\nMay, we could be at Wilmington, Georgetown, or any where else, sooner\nthan we can now be by land. I would have the battalions composed of\nsix companies; Colonels employed--Webb, Sprout, Huntington, Olney,\nHill, Barber, Gimat, _Laurens_; Majors Willet, Fish, Gibbes, Inspector\nSmith, and another; Brigadier Generals Huntington and Scamell, and\na good corps of artillerists under * * * * * *. My good friend, you\nwould be more important at head quarters; but if you donât stay there,\nyou know what you have promised to me. Adieu. Write often and long\nletters. It is probable I will be in the southern wilderness until the\nend of the war, far from head quarters, from the French army, from my\ncorrespondence with France; but the whole good I could have operated,\nin this last instance, must have taken place by this time. My best\nrespects and affectionate compliments wait on Mrs. Hamilton.\n\n                                                    Most friendly yours,\n                                                    La Fayette.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   April 15, 1781. Susquehanna.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nYou are so sensible a fellow, that you certainly can explain to me what\nis the matter that New-York is given up; that our letters to France go\nfor nothing; that while the French are coming, I am going. This last\nmatter gives great uneasiness to the Minister of France. All this is\nnot comprehensible to me, who, having been long from head quarters,\nhave lost the course of intelligence.\n\nHave you left the family, my dear sir? I suppose so; but from love to\nthe General, for whom you know my affection, I ardently wish it was not\nthe case; many, many reasons conspire to this desire of mine. But if\nyou do leave it, and if I go to exile, come and partake it with me.\n\n                                                                  Yours,\n                                                                  L. F.\n\n\n\n\nCOL. TILGHMAN TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Head Quarters, 27th April, 1781.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nBetween me and thee there is a gulf, or I should not have been thus\nlong without seeing you. My faith is strong, but not strong enough to\nattempt walking upon the waters. You must not suppose from my dealing\nso much in Scripture phrases, that I am either drunk with religion or\nwith wine, though had I been inclined to the latter, I might have found\na jolly companion in my Lord, who came here yesterday.\n\nWe have not a word of news. Whenever any arrives worth communicating,\nand good, you shall have it instantly--if bad, I will not promise so\nmuch dispatch.\n\nI must go over and see you soon, for I am not yet weaned from you, nor\ndo I desire to be. I will not present so cold words as compliments to\nMrs. Hamilton. She has an equal share of the best wishes of\n\n                                                 Your most affectionate,\n                                                 Tilghman.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                            De Peysterâs Point, April 27, 1781.\n\nSir:\n\nI imagine your Excellency has been informed, that in consequence of\nthe resolution of Congress for granting commissions to Aid-de-Camps\nappointed under the former establishment, I have obtained one of\nLieutenant Colonel in the army of the United States, bearing rank since\nthe 1st of March, 1777.\n\nIt is become necessary to me to apply to your Excellency, to know in\nwhat manner you foresee you will be able to employ me in the ensuing\ncampaign. I am ready to enter into activity whenever you think proper,\nthough I am not anxious to do it till the army takes the field, as\nbefore that period I perceive no object.\n\nUnconnected as I am with any regiment, I can have no other command than\nin a light corps; and I flatter myself my pretensions to this are good.\n\nYour Excellency knows, I have been in actual service since the\nbeginning of â76. I began in the line, and had I continued there, I\nought, in justice, to have been more advanced in rank than I now am.\nI believe my conduct, in the different capacities in which I have\nacted, has appeared to the officers of the army, in general, such as\nto merit their confidence and esteem; and I cannot suppose them to\nbe so ungenerous as not to see me with pleasure put into a situation\nstill to exercise the disposition I have always had of being useful\nto the United States. I mention these things, only to show that I do\nnot apprehend the same difficulties can exist in my case (which is\npeculiar), that have opposed the appointments to commands of some other\nofficers, not belonging to what is called the line. Though the light\ninfantry is chiefly formed, yet being detached to the southward, I take\nit for granted there will be a vanguard by detachment formed for this\narmy.\n\n                                     I have the honor to be,\n                                     Very respectfully,\n                                     Your Excellencyâs most obât servât,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\nTo General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   New Windsor, April 27, 1781.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of this date has not a little embarrassed me. You must\nremember the ferment in the Pennsylvania line last campaign, occasioned\nby the appointment of Major MâPherson; and you know the uneasiness\nwhich at this moment exists among the eastern officers, on account of\nthe commands conferred upon Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan, although it\nwas the result of absolute necessity.\n\nShould circumstances admit of the formation of another advanced corps,\nof which I see very little prospect, from present appearances, it can\nbe but small, and must be composed almost entirely of eastern troops:\nand to add to the discontents of the officers of those lines, by the\nfurther appointment of an officer of your rank to the command of\nit, or in it, would, I am certain, involve me in a difficulty of a\nvery disagreeable and delicate nature; and might, perhaps, lead to\nconsequences more serious than it is easy to imagine. While I adhere\nfirmly to the right of making such appointments as you request, I am\nat the same time obliged to reflect, that it will not do to push that\nright too far; more especially in a service like ours, and at a time so\ncritical as the present.\n\nI am convinced that no officer can, with justice, dispute your merit\nand abilities. The opposition heretofore made, has not been for the\nwant of those qualifications in the gentlemen who are, and have been,\nthe objects of discontent. The officers of the line contend, without\nhaving reference to particular persons, that it is a hardship and\nreflection upon them, to introduce brevet officers into commands\n(of some permanency), in which there are more opportunities of\ndistinguishing themselves than in the line of the army at large, and\nwith the men they have had the trouble to discipline and to prepare for\nthe field.\n\nMy principal concern arises from an apprehension, that you will\nimpute my refusal of your request to other motives than those I have\nexpressed; but I beg you to be assured, I am only influenced by the\nreasons which I have mentioned.\n\n                                          I am, dear Sir,\n                                          Your obedient, humble servant,\n                                          G. Washington.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Saratoga, April 29, 1781.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe troops here are destitute of meat, and I fear will abandon the\npost; the inhabitants in consternation, and preparing to fly, since\nthey have heard of the arrival of some of the enemyâs shipping at\nCrown Point. Flour we can procure for the present, I having, on my own\naccount, purchased one hundred barrels about twelve miles from this. If\nbeef is sent up so as to enable the troops to remain, an engineer will\nbe absolutely necessary to construct two or three small fortifications.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\n                                      Most affectionately and sincerely,\n                                      Yours, etc., etc.,\n                                      Ph. Schuyler.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\n\n\n                                                         April 30, 1781.\n\nSir:\n\nI was among the first who were convinced that an administration, by\nsingle men, was essential to the proper management of the affairs of\nthis country. I am persuaded, now, it is the only resource we have, to\nextricate ourselves from the distresses which threaten the subversion\nof our cause. It is palpable, that the people have lost all confidence\nin our public councils; and it is a fact, of which I dare say you are\nas well apprised as myself, that our friends in Europe are in the same\ndisposition. I have been in a situation that has enabled me to obtain a\nbetter idea of this than most others; and I venture to assert, that the\nCourt of France will never give half the succors to this country, while\nCongress hold the reins of administration in their own hands, which\nthey would grant, if these were intrusted to individuals of established\nreputation, and conspicuous for probity, abilities, and fortune.\n\nWith respect to ourselves, there is so universal and rooted a\ndiffidence of the government, that, if we could be assured the future\nmeasures of Congress would be dictated by the most perfect wisdom and\npublic spirit, there would be still a necessity for a change in the\nforms of our administration, to give a new spring and current to the\npassions and hopes of the people. To me it appears evident, that an\nexecutive ministry, composed of men with the qualifications I have\ndescribed, would speedily restore the credit of government abroad\nand at home--would induce our allies to greater exertions in our\nbehalf--would inspire confidence in moneyed men in Europe, as well as\nin America, to lend us those sums of which it may be demonstrated we\nstand in need, from the disproportion of our national wealth to the\nexpenses of the war.\n\nI hope, sir, you will not consider it as a compliment, when I assure\nyou that I heard, with the greatest satisfaction, of your nomination\nto the department of finance. In a letter of mine, last summer, to Mr.\nDuane, urging, among other things, the plan of an executive ministry, I\nmentioned you as the person who ought to fill that department. I know\nof no other in America, who unites so many advantages; and of course\nevery impediment to your acceptance, is to me a subject of chagrin. I\nflatter myself Congress will not preclude the public from your services\nby an obstinate refusal of reasonable conditions; and, as one deeply\ninterested in the event, I am happy in believing you will not easily\nbe discouraged from undertaking an office, by which you may render\nAmerica, and the world, no less a service than the establishment of\nAmerican independence! âTis by introducing order into our finances--by\nrestoring public credit--not by gaining battles, that we are finally to\ngain our object. âTis by putting ourselves in a condition to continue\nthe war--not by temporary, violent, and unnatural efforts to bring it\nto a decisive issue, that we shall, in reality, bring it to a speedy\nand successful one. In the frankness of truth I believe, sir, you are\nthe man best capable of performing this great work.\n\nIn expectation that all difficulties will be removed, and that you\nwill ultimately act on terms you approve, I take the liberty to submit\nto you some ideas, relative to the objects of your department. I\npretend not to be an able financier: it is a part of administration\nwhich has been least in my way, and, of course, has least occupied my\ninquiries and reflections. Neither have I had leisure or materials to\nmake accurate calculations. I have been obliged to depend on memory\nfor important facts, for want of the authorities from which they are\ndrawn. With all these disadvantages, my plan must necessarily be crude\nand defective; but if it may be a basis for something more perfect, or\nif it contains any hints that may be of use to you, the trouble I have\ntaken myself, or may give you, will not be misapplied. At any rate, the\nconfidence I have in your judgment, assures me that you will receive,\nwith pleasure, communications of this sort: if they contain any thing\nuseful, they will promote your views and the public benefit; if not,\nthe only evil is the trouble of reading them; and the best informed\nwill frequently derive lights, even from reveries of projectors and\nquacks. There is scarcely any plan so bad as not to have something good\nin it. I trust mine to your candor without further apology; you will at\nleast do justice to my intention.\n\nThe first step towards determining what ought to be done in the\nfinances of this country, is to estimate, in the best manner we can,\nits capacity for revenue; and the proportion between what it is able to\nafford, and what it stands in need of, for the expenses of its civil\nand military establishments. There occur to me two ways of doing this:\n1st. By examining what proportion the revenues of other countries have\nborne to their stock of wealth, and applying the rule to ourselves,\nwith proper allowance for the difference of circumstances. 2d. By\ncomparing the result of this rule with the product of taxes in those\nStates which have been the most in earnest in taxation. The reason for\nhaving recourse to the first method is, that our own experience of our\nfaculties in this respect, has not been sufficiently clear, or uniform,\nto admit of a certain conclusion: so that it will be more satisfactory\nto judge of them by a general principle, drawn by the example of other\nnations, compared with what we have effected ourselves, than to rely\nentirely upon the latter.\n\nThe nations with whose wealth and revenues we are best acquainted, are\nFrance, Great Britain, and the United Provinces. The real wealth of a\nnation, consisting in its labor and commodities, is to be estimated\nby the sign of that wealth--its circulating cash. There may be times\nwhen, from particular accidents, the quantity of this may exceed or\nfall short of a just representative; but it will turn again to a proper\nlevel, and, in the general course of things, maintain itself in that\nstate.\n\nThe circulation of France is almost wholly carried on in the precious\nmetals; and its current cash is estimated at from fifteen to sixteen\nhundred millions of livres. The net revenue of the kingdom, the sum\nwhich actually passes into the public coffers, is somewhere between\nthree hundred and sixty and four hundred millions, about one fourth of\nthe whole of its currency. An estimate of the wealth of this nation\nis liable to less fallacy than of that of the other two, as it makes\nlittle use of paper credit, which may be artificially increased, and\neven supported, a long time beyond its natural bounds.\n\nIt is supposed that the gross sum extracted from the people by the\ncollectors of the revenue, may be one-third more than that which goes\ninto the treasury: but as their exactions are excessive, and fall too\nheavy on particular orders, who are by that means reduced to indigence\nand misery, it is to be inferred, that, with moderate and reasonable\nexpenses of collection, the present revenue is as great as the kingdom\ncan well afford, from its present quantity of wealth.\n\nThe circulating cash of Great Britain, in paper and specie, may be\nstated at about forty millions of pounds sterling. Mr. Hume supposes\nit to have been, at the time he wrote his Essay on the Balance of\nTrade, about thirty millions. Other writers have carried it to fifty,\nand it is probably in a medium that we shall find the truth. I do not\ninclude in this, the whole amount of Bank notes, Exchequer bills,\nIndia bonds, etc. etc.; but only such part as is really employed in\ncommon circulation, and performs the offices of current cash. In â75,\nby Dr. Priceâs statement, the net revenue of Great Britain was ten\nmillions--that is, about one-fourth of its current cash, as in France.\n\nI have never met with any calculation that might be depended upon, of\nthe current cash of the Seven Provinces. Almost the whole of their\ncoin, as well as large quantities of plate and bullion, are shut up\nin the Bank of Amsterdam. The real wealth of the Bank is believed to\nbe about fifteen millions sterling; though, upon the strength of\nthis fund, it has a credit almost unlimited, that answers all the\npurposes of cash in trade. As the Dutch, by their prudent maxims, have\ncommonly the rate of exchange throughout Europe in their favor, and\na considerable balance of trade, the use of paper credit (which, in\npart, also depends upon the particular nature of their Banks) has not\nthe same tendency with them, as in England, to banish the precious\nmetals. We may therefore suppose these to be here, as in France, the\ntrue sign of the wealth of the nation. If to the fifteen millions in\nBank, we add two millions of specie for the retail circulation and\nvarious transactions of business, we shall, I imagine, have nearly the\ntrue stock of wealth of the United Provinces. Their revenues amount\nto something more than four millions, and bear the same proportion to\nthe stock from which they are drawn, as those of France and England.\nI confess, however, the data, in their case, are not sufficiently\nascertained to permit us to rely equally on the result. From these\nthree examples we may venture to deduce this general rule,--that the\nproportion of revenue which a nation is capable of affording, is\nabout one-fourth of its circulating cash, so far as this is a just\nrepresentative of its labor and commodities.\n\nThis is only applicable to commercial countries, because, in those\nwhich are not so, the circulating cash is not an adequate sign. A great\npart of domestic commerce is carried on by barter; and the State must\nreceive a part of its dues in the labor and commodities themselves. The\nproportion, however, of the revenues of such a State to the aggregate\nof its labor and commodities, ought to be the same as in the case\nof trading nations to their circulating cash; with this difference,\nthat the difficulty of collection and transportation, the waste and\nembezzlement inseparable from this mode of revenue, would make the real\nadvantage and ultimate gain to the State, infinitely less than when the\npublic dues are paid in cash.\n\nWhen I say that one-fourth part of its stock of wealth is the revenue\nwhich a nation is capable of affording to the government, I must be\nunderstood in a qualified, not in an absolute sense. It would be\npresumptuous to fix a precise boundary to the ingenuity of financiers,\nor to the patience of the people: but this we may safely say, that\ntaxation is already carried, in the nations we have been speaking of;\nto an extent which does not admit of a very considerable increase\nwithout a proportionable increase of industry. This suffices for a\nstandard to us; and we may proceed to the application.\n\nFrom a comparison of the several estimates I have seen, of the quantity\nof current cash in this country previous to the war (specie and paper),\nI have settled my opinion of the amount at thirty millions of dollars,\nof which about eight might have been in specie: one-fourth of this, by\nanalogy, was at that time the proper revenue of these States; that is,\nseven and a half millions of dollars.\n\nAs taxation, however, has, by slow gradations, been carried to an\nextreme in those countries which I have chosen as examples, that would\nnot be, but in a course of time, practicable in this, where the people\nhave been so little accustomed to taxes, it may be doubted whether\nit would be possible to raise the same proportion of revenue here.\nThe object of the war, I imagine, would supply the want of habit,\nand reconcile the minds of the people to paying to the utmost of\ntheir abilities, provided the taxes were judiciously imposed, and the\nrevenues wisely administered. Besides this, there is a circumstance\nin our favor, which puts it in the power of government to raise an\nequal proportion of revenue without burthening the lower classes of\nthe people in the same degree as in Europe. This circumstance is the\nmuch greater equality of fortunes, by which means men, in this country,\nmay be made to contribute to the public exigencies in a much juster\nproportion to their property; and this is in fact the case. In France\nthe rich have gained so entire an ascendant, that there is a constant\nsacrifice of the ease and happiness of the people to their avarice and\nluxury: their burthens are in no proportion to those of the middle\norder, and still less to those of the poor. In England and Holland the\ncase, though not altogether, is in a great measure the same. There are\nalso men of very large moneyed capitals, which were either formerly\nexempt from taxes by being in the public funds, or, having no visible\nrepresentative for taxation to operate upon, enjoy virtually the same\nadvantages. But if, at the commencement of the war, the ability of\nthese States for revenue may be rated at seven and a half millions of\ndollars, when the amount of its circulating cash was thirty millions,\nnow that it is reduced more than one-half in real value, to what\nrevenue are they to be supposed equal at this time? I should judge\nabout one-fifth less, and not more.\n\nThe diminution of our circulating cash is principally artificial. It is\ntrue, our foreign commerce has declined by the war, but our domestic\ncommerce has increased. I know of no good reason to believe, that the\nquantity of labor and commodities have been materially diminished. Our\nexports have lessened, but our internal consumption has augmented. The\nmen employed in the army, and in the departments connected with it,\nconsume and waste three times as much as the same number of men in\ncivil life. A number of husbandmen have been taken from their ploughs\ninto military service; but the progress of our natural population\nhas, in part, supplied their place; and the demands of the war have\nincreased individual industry. The great influx of money, at first\noperated upon the avarice of the people, and, for a long time, served\nalso as a stimulus to industry, which taxation has since kept up on the\nprinciple of necessity. Notwithstanding the demands and competitions of\ntwo armies for supplies, we see that corn, which is the staple of these\nmiddle States, is cheaper than for some years before the war; a strong\nargument of plenty.\n\nWe may infer from all this, that we stand in need now of nearly the\nsame quantity of medium for our circulation as before the war. The\ndepreciation of the money below the standard, is to be attributed to\na want of confidence rather than to a decay of resources. We find the\npeople, in some of the States, distressed to pay their taxes, for\nwant of money, with ample means otherwise; which is a proof, that\nour current cash is not a competent representative of the labor and\ncommodities of the country. Another proof of the same nature is, that\nparticular States who have found no small difficulty in collecting\ntheir pecuniary taxes, have been successful in raising contributions\nto a large amount in kind. This country never having been a country of\nmanufactures, the productions of the soil ever were, as they still are,\nthe principal source of revenue. The inhabitants have abridged their\nwants of foreign articles, from the scarcity of them, and have, in\npart, supplied their place by home manufactures; which, being chiefly\nconducted by the women, take nothing from the labor appropriated to\nagriculture, while it enables the farmer to spare a larger portion of\nhis income to the public.\n\nWhatever diminution our means of revenue may have suffered, must\nbe accounted for on the decay of foreign trade, and on the loss of\nterritory. The imposts on trade in Great Britain amounted to about a\nfourth of its total revenue. The proportion must be less in America.\nBut suppose it to be the same; suppose our external commerce to\nbe reduced one-half, which I believe is an ample allowance, then,\none-eighth should be deducted from our revenue on this account; which\nwould bring it down to six millions, five hundred and sixty-two\nthousand, five hundred dollars. Allow for the loss of Georgia and\nSouth Carolina one-eighth of this sum: this would reduce the income\nof the remaining States to five millions, seven hundred and forty-two\nthousand, one hundred and eighty-eight, and four-eighths, dollars.\nBut as the allowance, in both cases, is large, the diminution I have\nalready supposed, of one-fifth of the whole, appears to be nearest the\ntruth; which leaves these States with a net revenue of six millions of\ndollars.\n\nWe will now examine how far this rule agrees with experience, and with\nwhat has already been effected in these States. Massachusetts may serve\nas a criterion. This is one of the States where taxation has been\ncarried furthest. Taxes were so heavy last year, that I am informed\nthere were real marks of distress among some classes of the people. The\nLegislature, in their late Address, tell us that they amounted to six\nhundred thousand pounds lawful: and they appear to have thought the\npressure of them too great, by reducing them at a time when they are\nobliged to have recourse to a large loan, to answer the exigencies of\nthe current year.\n\nThe taxes they specify which seem to belong to those of the present\nyear, with the addition of the bounties for raising men, and the beef\nsupply, may be estimated at near five hundred thousand pounds.\n\nThis State is in a different situation from any other. Its position\nhas made it impossible for the enemy to intercept its trade; while\nthat of all the others has been greatly injured or totally obstructed.\nIt has become, in consequence, the mart of the States northward of\nPennsylvania; and its commerce has enlarged itself much beyond its\nformer limits. A great part of the money expended for the support of\nthe war, has been disbursed there. Congress, in their requisitions for\nmoney, have rated the quota of Massachusetts at â â of the whole;\nbut I believe its ability, at this time, is in the proportion of\none-fifth. I found this estimation on an impartial comparison of the\ncircumstances of the several States.\n\nAdmitting the proportion to be just, and taking the taxes of the\npresent year as a standard, the gross amount of our collective revenues\nwould be two millions, five hundred thousand pounds lawful; or eight\nmillions, three hundred and thirty-three thousand, three hundred and\nthirty-three, and one-third, dollars. The expense of collection, in\nEngland, is about the ninth of the gross amount; and considering\nthat our revenue is to be raised in eleven different governments,\neach having a complete set of collectors of its own, the expense of\ncollection, with us, will in all probability be not much less than it\nis in England. Supposing it to be the same, and that the taxes were to\nprove as productive as their nominal amount, our net revenue would then\nbe seven millions, four hundred and seven thousand, four hundred and\neight, and one-half, dollars; which considerably exceeds what it ought\nto be by my first calculation.\n\nBut there are considerations which may induce us to make large\ndeductions from this sum. When the Legislature tells us, that the\ntaxes of last year amounted to six hundred thousand pounds, it also\ntells us that there was _a part_ of them still to be levied; which,\namong other things, had occasioned them to postpone the next tax to a\nfuture session. Whatever is due on the last year, may be considered,\nin effect, as an anticipation on the taxes of the present; for it takes\noff so much from the ability of the people to pay them. The chances\nare, that the additional impositions projected for the current year\nwill not be raised in their full extent. Taxes are seldom or never so\nproductive as their estimated value; and in a case like this, must be\nexpected to be more than commonly deficient.\n\nIt is to be observed, also, that the last year was a year of peculiar\nexertion. There was a general expectation of some attempt, in\nconjunction with our allies, decisive of the war. This made the people\nstrain their efforts beyond their natural abilities: and yet they did\nnot comply with the demands of the Legislature.\n\nThe money for the bounties this year, which I have calculated at\nsixty thousand pounds,[12] may, in like manner, be regarded as an\nextraordinary and special contribution, which the people may be willing\nto submit to, over and above what they could probably afford to pay, to\nget rid of the insupportable inconvenience of temporary enlistments.\n\nReasonable deductions on these accounts being made, will bring the two\ncalculations to a pretty exact agreement, and make them confirm each\nother. But were not this the case, I should be inclined, in preference,\nto trust the first, as being founded on a basis better known and better\nascertained by experience. I believe, however, we may safely conclude,\nfrom both, that between six and seven millions of dollars is the proper\nrevenue of these States, after the dismemberment of South Carolina and\nGeorgia.\n\nHaving formed an estimate of our ability for revenue, the next thing\nto be ascertained is, the annual expense of our civil and military\nestablishments. With tolerable economy, I should suppose two millions\nand a half of dollars would amply suffice for the first, including the\nparticular administration of each State. For the second, judiciously\nmanaged, eight millions of dollars would be adequate, calculating for\nan army of twenty thousand men, which are as many as we shall stand in\nneed of, or be able[13] to raise. Eleven millions of dollars will be\nthen the amount of the annual expenses of these States. I speak on a\nsupposition that a system were embraced, well adapted to rescuing our\naffairs from the chaos in which they are now involved; and which, while\nit continues, must baffle all calculation.\n\nThe difference between our revenues and expenses, on the preceding\nscale, will be from four to four and a half millions of dollars; which\ndeficiency must of course be supplied by credit, foreign or domestic,\nor both.\n\nWith regard to credit abroad, I think we have little chance of\nobtaining a sufficiency, nearly to answer our purpose. France, by all\nthe reforms she can make in her interior economy, by all the means\nshe can procure in loans and lotteries, in addition to her revenue,\ncan do little more than satisfy her own wants. The death of the\nEmpress Queen, and the notorious hostility of the Emperor, will add\nto the number of these. She will, in all probability, be obliged to\npay greater attention to her army, which has been neglected, for\nseveral years past, to apply all the resources of the kingdom to\nthe improvement of the navy. Though Russia and Prussia, by the last\nadvices, seemed disposed to control the ill-humor of the Emperor,\nFrance will hardly think it prudent to leave herself in a defenceless\ncondition, relying on the precarious friendship and momentary interests\nof other powers. The increase of her army will necessarily increase her\nexpenses, as she cannot, in the present state of things, retrench any\nthing from the navy; and of course she will have less money to spare\nto allies. It has been observed, that France has hitherto imposed none\nof the additional taxes usual in time of war; by doing which, it is\nimagined she would have it in her power, not only to supply her own\nwants better, but to contribute largely to ours. To this it has been\nanswered, with great appearance of reason, that the credit of the\nfinancier very much depends on his having such a resource in reserve,\nwhich, being considered as a mean he may command, when necessary, to\nfulfil his engagements, disposes moneyed men to lend to him with the\ngreater freedom and confidence. The breaking in upon that resource,\ntherefore (it is said), would injure credit, and obstruct loans in a\ndegree that could not be compensated by the direct value of the revenue\nit would furnish.\n\nUpon the whole, however, from a variety of siftings and inquiries, I\nshould be mistaken if France did not lend this country eight or ten\nmillions of livres annually, during the war; provided its finances were\nonce put upon a reasonable footing: but this is not above a third of\nour wants.\n\nI find no reason to flatter ourselves that we have much to expect\neither from the ability or inclination of Spain. Her government is far\nfrom being so rich as is vulgarly imagined. The mines of South America,\nof late years, have been less liberal of their profits; and, for fear\nof accidents, but a small part of their product, since the war, has\nbeen imported into Europe. The extreme indolence of the Spaniards,\nand their neglect of agriculture, manufactures, and trade, make them\ntributary to their more industrious neighbors, who drain them of their\nprecious metals as fast as they arrive.\n\nBut if they were heartily disposed to do it, they might still afford\nus some assistance. Their conduct, hitherto, has manifested no such\ndisposition: it has been as cold and reserved as it could well be.\nThe bills drawn upon them have not been rejected, but they have not\nbeen paid. Their permitting the residence of a British emissary among\nthem, and the countenance they give him, unprecedented in a state of\nwar, afford just room for a distrust of their intentions, though it\nmay be nothing more than a stroke of policy, to play him off against\nour negotiations, and make us bid higher for their friendship. Their\nmethod of prosecuting the war is passive, to a degree that can scarcely\nbe resolved even into Spanish supineness; but seems to have a more\ncorrupt original. A bigoted prince, governed by a greedy confessor, is\na character on which little dependence can be placed.\n\nâTis not on Spain, then, that we are to build our hopes of any\nconsiderable succors in money.\n\nThe Dutch government has of long standing mortgaged all its revenues.\nTaxation has been carried to a length that admits of little extension.\nâTis from its credit with its own citizens, that it must derive the\nmeans of making war. It has every thing to do. Its fleet is to be in a\nmanner created anew; and its land forces to be recruited, having been,\nfor some time past, suffered to decline very much. It will, therefore,\nstand in need of all its credit for its own uses. Of course we have\nnothing to expect from the government of that country.\n\nThe individuals will not have confidence enough in our public councils,\nto embark any considerable part of their fortunes with us, on the\nordinary principles of a loan. Stronger inducements, the prospect of\ncommercial advantages, securities different from the mere faith of the\nUnited States, must be held out, to tempt them to engage far with us.\nThe plan I am going to propose, endeavors to conciliate these objects.\n\nAs to internal loans, on which, after all, we must chiefly depend,\nthere are two things that operate against them, to any large amount;\nthe want of a sufficient number of men, with sufficient moneyed\ncapitals to lend the sums required, and the want of confidence in those\nwho are able to lend, to make them willing to part with their money. It\nmay be added, that they can employ it to greater advantage in traffic,\nthan by merely lending it on interest.\n\nTo surmount these obstacles, and give individuals ability and\ninclination to lend, in any proportion to the wants of government, a\nplan must be devised, which, by incorporating their means together,\nand uniting them with those of the public, will, on the foundation of\nthat incorporation and union, erect a mass of credit that will supply\nthe defect of moneyed capital, and answer all the purposes of cash; a\nplan which will offer adventurers immediate advantages, analogous to\nthose they receive by employing their money in trade, and, eventually,\ngreater advantages; a plan which will give them the greatest security\nthe nature of the case will admit for what they lend; and which will\nnot only advance their own interest, and secure the independence of\ntheir country, but, in its progress, have the most beneficial influence\nupon its future commerce, and be a source of national strength and\nwealth.\n\nI mean the institution of a NATIONAL BANK. This I regard, in some shape\nor other, as an expedient essential to our safety and success; unless,\nby a happy turn of European affairs, the war should speedily terminate\nin a manner upon which it would be unwise to reckon. There is no other\nthat can give to government that extensive and systematic credit,\nwhich the defect of our revenues makes indispensably necessary to its\noperations.\n\nThe longer it is delayed, the more difficult it becomes. Our affairs\ngrow every day more relaxed and more involved; public credit hastens\nto a more irretrievable catastrophe; the means for executing the plan\nare exhausted in partial and temporary efforts. The loan now making in\nMassachusetts would have gone a great way in establishing the funds on\nwhich the Bank must stand.\n\nI am aware of all the objections that have been made to public Banks;\nand that they are not without enlightened and respectable opponents.\nBut all that has been said against them, only tends to prove that,\nlike all other good things, they are subject to abuse, and, when\nabused, become pernicious. The precious metals, by similar arguments,\nmay be proven to be injurious. It is certain that the mines of South\nAmerica have had great influence in banishing industry from Spain, and\nsinking it in real wealth and importance. Great power, commerce, and\nriches, or, in other words, great national prosperity, may, in like\nmanner, be denominated evils; for they lead to insolence, an inordinate\nambition, a vicious luxury, licentiousness of morals, and all those\nvices which corrupt government, enslave the people, and precipitate\nthe ruin of a nation. But no wise statesman will reject the good, from\nan apprehension of the ill. The truth is, in human affairs there is\nno good, pure and unmixed: every advantage has two sides: and wisdom\nconsists in availing ourselves of the good, and guarding as much as\npossible against the bad.\n\nThe tendency of a National Bank is to increase public and private\ncredit. The former gives power to the State, for the protection of\nits rights and interests: and the latter facilitates and extends the\noperations of commerce among individuals. Industry is increased,\ncommodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufactures flourish: and\nherein consists the true wealth and prosperity of a State.\n\nMost commercial nations have found it necessary to institute Banks: and\nthey have proved to be the happiest engines that ever were invented for\nadvancing trade. Venice, Genoa, Hamburgh, Holland, and England, are\nexamples of their utility. They owe their riches, commerce, and the\nfigure they have made at different periods, in a great degree to this\nsource. Great Britain is indebted for the immense efforts she has been\nable to make, in so many illustrious and successful wars, essentially\nto that vast fabric of credit raised on this foundation. âTis by this\nalone she now menaces our independence.\n\nShe has, indeed, abused the advantage, and now stands on a precipice.\nHer example should both persuade and warn us. âTis in republics where\nBanks are most easily established and supported, and where they are\nleast liable to abuse. Our situation will not expose us to frequent\nwars; and the public will have no temptation to overstrain its credit.\nIn my opinion, we ought not to hesitate, because we have no other\nresource. The long and expensive wars of King William, had drained\nEngland of its specie: its commerce began to droop for want of a proper\nmedium: its taxes were unproductive, and its revenues declined. The\nadministration wisely had recourse to the institution of a Bank; and\nit relieved the national difficulties. We are in the same, and still\ngreater, want of a sufficient medium. We have little specie: the paper\nwe have is of small value, and rapidly descending to less: we are\nimmersed in a war for our existence as a nation, for our liberty and\nhappiness as a people: we have no revenues nor no credit. A Bank, if\npracticable, is the only thing that can give us either the one or the\nother.\n\nBesides these great and cardinal motives to such an institution, and\nthe advantages we should enjoy from it, in common with other nations,\nour situation, relatively to Europe and to the West Indies, would give\nus some peculiar advantages.\n\nNothing is more common than for men to pass from the abuse of a good\nthing, to the disuse of it. Some persons, disgusted by the depreciation\nof the money, are chimerical enough to imagine it would be beneficial\nto abolish all paper credit, annihilate the whole of what is now in\ncirculation, and depend altogether upon our specie, both for commerce\nand finance. The scheme is altogether visionary, and in the attempt\nwould be fatal. We have not a competent stock of specie in this\ncountry, either to answer the purposes of circulation in trade, or to\nserve as a basis for revenue. The whole amount of what we have, I am\npersuaded, does not exceed six millions of dollars, one-fifth of the\ncirculating medium before the war. To suppose this would be sufficient\nfor the operations of commerce, would be to suppose that our domestic\nand foreign commerce were both reduced four-fifths: a supposition that\ncarries absurdity in the face of it. It follows that if our paper\nmoney were destroyed, a great part of the transactions of traffic\nmust be carried on by barter; a mode inconvenient, partial, confined,\ndestructive both of commerce and industry. With the addition of the\npaper we now have, this evil exists in too great a degree. With respect\nto revenue, could the whole of our specie be drawn into the public\ntreasury annually, we have seen that it would be little more than one\nhalf of our annual expense. But this would be impracticable; it has\nnever been effected in any country. Where the numerary of a country\nis a sufficient representative, there is only a certain proportion of\nit that can be drawn out of daily circulation; because, without the\nnecessary quantity of cash, a stagnation of business would ensue. How\nsmall, then, would be the proportion of the six millions (in itself so\nunequal a representative) which the public would be able to extract in\nrevenue. It must either have little or no revenue, or it must receive\nits dues in kind; on the inefficacy and inconveniences of which mode, I\nhave already remarked. The necessity for it, in part, unhappily now has\nplace, for the cause assigned, a deficiency of current cash: but were\nwe to establish it as our principal dependence, it would be impossible\nto contrive a mode less productive to the public, more contrary to the\nhabits and inclinations of the people, or more baneful to industry.\n\nBut waiving the objections on this head, there would still remain\na balance of four millions of dollars more than these States can\nfurnish in revenue, which must be provided for the yearly expense of\nthe war. How is this to be procured without a paper credit, to supply\nthe deficiency of specie, and enable the moneyed men to lend? This\nquestion, I apprehend, will be of no easy solution.\n\nIn the present system of things, the health of a State, particularly\na commercial one, depends on a due quantity and regular circulation\nof cash, as much as the health of an animal body depends upon the due\nquantity and regular circulation of the blood. There are indisputable\nindications that we have not a sufficient medium; and what we have is\nin continual fluctuation. The only cure to our public disorders, is to\nfix the value of the currency we now have, and increase it to a proper\nstandard, in a species that will have the requisite stability.\n\nThe error of those who would explode paper money altogether, originates\nin not making proper distinctions. Our paper was, in its nature, liable\nto depreciation, because it had no funds for its support, and was not\nupheld by private credit. The emissions under the resolution of March,\nâ80, have partly the former advantage, but are destitute of the latter,\nwhich is equally essential. No paper credit can be substantial, or\ndurable, which has not funds, and which does not unite, immediately,\nthe interest and influence of the moneyed men, in its establishment and\npreservation. A credit begun on this basis, will, in process of time,\ngreatly exceed its funds: but this requires time, and a well settled\nopinion in its favor. âTis in a National Bank, alone, that we can find\nthe ingredients to constitute a wholesome, solid, and beneficial paper\ncredit.\n\nI am aware that, in the present temper of menâs minds, it will be no\neasy task to inspire a relish for a project of this kind: but much will\ndepend on the address and personal credit of the proposer. In your\nhands I should not despair: and I should have the greater hopes for\nwhat I am informed appeared to be the disposition, at the promulgation\nof the plan for a loan in Massachusetts. The men of property in\nAmerica, are enlightened about their own interest, and would easily\nbe brought to see the advantages of a good plan. They ought not to\nbe discouraged at what has happened heretofore, when they behold\nthe administration of our finances put into a better channel. The\nviolations of public engagements, hitherto, have proceeded more from a\nnecessity produced by ignorance and mismanagement, than from levity or\na disregard to the obligations of good faith.\n\nShould the success, in the first instance, not be as complete as\nthe extent of the plan requires, this should not hinder its being\nundertaken. It is of the nature of a Bank, wisely instituted, and\nwisely administered, to extend itself, and, from small beginnings, grow\nto a magnitude that could not have been foreseen.\n\nThe plan I propose, requires a stock of three millions of pounds,\nlawful money; but if one-half the sum could be obtained, I should\nentertain no doubt of its full success. It now remains to submit my\nplan, which I rather offer as an outline, than as a finished plan.\nIt contains, however, the general principles. To each article, in an\nopposite column, I shall affix an explanatory remark.\n\n Art I. A Bank to be              Remark 1.

VI. The United              Remark 6. This mode of pledging\n States, collectively and         the public faith, makes it as difficult\n particularly, to become          to be infringed as could possibly\n responsible for all the          be devised.

The reason of having\n issue notes payable at sight,    them payable at sight, is to inspire\n in pounds, shillings, and        the greater confidence and give them a\n pence, lawful: all of twenty     readier currency: nor do I apprehend\n shillings, and under, to bear    there would be any danger from it.

The power\n                                  of discounting bills of exchange will\n                                  be a considerable one.

It will be of\n have a right to contract with    great importance to the success of the\n the French government for the    subscriptions, that a previous assurance\n supply of its fleets and armies  of these contracts should take place:\n in _America_, and to contract    the profits of them would be no trifling\n with Congress for the supply of  inducement to adventurers; it would have\n their armies.                    the air of employing the money subscribed\n                                  in trade.

It is\n                                  so clearly the interest of the French\n                                  government to enter into these contracts,\n                                  that they must be blind not to do it,\n                                  especially when it is proposed under the\n                                  aspect of a method of re-establishing\n                                  our finances.

It is of the greatest\n to become responsible for the    importance that the old currency should\n redemption of all the paper      be fixed at a certain value, or there\n now emitted; the old, at forty   will be danger of its infecting the\n for one in thirty years, the     future paper: besides, we want to raise\n new at par, with gold and        it to a point that will make it approach\n silver, according to the terms   nearer to an adequate medium. I have\n promised by Congress in their    chosen the resolution of March, â80, as a\n resolution of March, â80.        standard. We ought not, on any account,\n One-third of the first to be     to raise the value of the old paper\n redeemed at the end of every     higher than forty to one, for this will\n ten years; and the whole of      give it about the degree of value that\n the last to be redeemed at the   is most salutary; at the same time that\n expiration of the six years      it will avoid a second breach of faith,\n specified by Congress, with the  which would cause a violent death to\n interest of five per cent. The   all future credit. A stable currency is\n United States, in compensation   an idea fundamental to all practicable\n for this responsibility, to      schemes of finance. It is the duty and\n establish certain funds for an   interest of the public to give stability\n annuity, payable to the Bank,    to that which now exists; and it will be\n equal to the discharge of the    the interest of the Bank, which alone\n whole amount of the paper        can effect it, to co-operate. I have\n currency in thirty years, with   not mentioned the amount of the annuity\n an interest of two per cent.     to be paid by Congress, because I have\n per annum.                       not materials to judge what quantity\n                                  of paper money now exists; since it\n                                  will be necessary to take all the State\n                                  emissions into the calculation. I suppose\n                                  (including State emissions) there may be\n                                  about four hundred millions of dollars of\n                                  the old standard, and about four millions\n                                  of the new.[16] This will give us, in\n                                  specie-value, about fourteen millions\n                                  of dollars. This is what the Bank is\n                                  to become answerable for, and what the\n                                  public is to pay, by an annuity of thirty\n                                  years, with two per cent. interest. This\n                                  annuity would amount to six hundred\n                                  and eleven thousand, three hundred and\n                                  thirty-three, and one-third, dollars,\n                                  for which funds are to be provided. By\n                                  a rough calculation, I find that the\n                                  Bank would gain, in the thirty years,\n                                  about three millions of dollars, on the\n                                  simple footing of interest; and that it\n                                  will, at different periods, have more\n                                  public money in its possession, than it\n                                  will be in advance at others: so that,\n                                  upon the whole, the sum it will gain in\n                                  interest, will be for the loan of its\n                                  credit to the public, not of any specific\n                                  sum of cash. Besides, the interest of\n                                  the Bank may gain a very considerable\n                                  sum by the purchases it may make of the\n                                  old paper at its current value, before\n                                  the influence of this plan has time to\n                                  bring it back to the point at which it\n                                  is intended to be fixed.[17] It is the\n                                  obvious interest of the United States to\n                                  concur in this plan, because, by paying\n                                  three millions of dollars in interest\n                                  to the Bank, more than it would have\n                                  to pay to the money-holders, agreeably\n                                  to its present engagements, it would\n                                  avoid a new breach of faith, fix its\n                                  circulating medium increased in value\n                                  more than one-half, render the taxes more\n                                  productive, and introduce order into its\n                                  finances, without which our independence\n                                  is lost. It will also have only about\n                                  two-thirds of the funds to establish for\n                                  this plan that are required by the Act of\n                                  March, â80, to discharge the new bills:\n                                  it will, of course, reserve a large\n                                  balance towards the current expenses,\n                                  which is no insignificant consideration.\n                                  Perhaps it may be imagined, that the same\n                                  funds established for the redemption\n                                  of the money in the same time, without\n                                  passing through the Bank, would have an\n                                  equal effect upon its credit, and then\n                                  we should save the interest of two per\n                                  cent. Experience proves the contrary. We\n                                  find the new notes depreciating in the\n                                  States which have provided good funds.\n                                  The truth is, there is not confidence\n                                  enough in any funds merely public. The\n                                  responsibility of the Bank would beget\n                                  a much stronger persuasion of the paper\n                                  being redeemed, and have incomparably\n                                  more efficacy in raising and confirming\n                                  its credit. Besides, the Bank might\n                                  immediately reduce the quantity by\n                                  purchase, which the public could not do.\n                                  It will be observed, that of the six\n                                  millions of dollars which constitute our\n                                  annual revenue, I require nine hundred\n                                  and seventy-nine thousand, three hundred\n                                  and thirty-three, and one-third, dollars,\n                                  in funds, to reimburse the loan for the\n                                  first year, and pay off the annuity for\n                                  the redemption of the old paper. It may\n                                  be asked, where these funds are to be\n                                  procured in the present impotence of\n                                  our federal government. I answer, there\n                                  are ample means for them, and they must\n                                  be had. Congress must deal plainly with\n                                  their constituents. They must tell them,\n                                  that power without revenue is a bubble;\n                                  that unless they give them substantial\n                                  resources of the latter, they will not\n                                  have enough of the former, either to\n                                  prosecute the war, or to maintain the\n                                  Union in peace; that, in short, they\n                                  must, in justice to the public and to\n                                  their own honor, renounce the vain\n                                  attempt of carrying on the war without\n                                  either; a perseverance in which, can only\n                                  deceive the people, and betray their\n                                  safety. They must demand an instant,\n                                  positive, and perpetual investiture of\n                                  an impost on trade; a land tax, and a\n                                  poll tax, to be collected by their own\n                                  agents. This Act to become a part of the\n                                  Confederation.\n\n                                  It has ever been my opinion that Congress\n                                  ought to have complete sovereignty in\n                                  all but the mere municipal law of each\n                                  State; and I wish to see a convention\n                                  of all the States, with full power to\n                                  alter and amend, finally and irrevocably,\n                                  the present futile and senseless\n                                  Confederation.\n\n                                  The taxes specified, may be made to\n                                  amount to three millions of dollars; the\n                                  other three millions to be raised by\n                                  requisition, as heretofore.\n\n Art. XV. The Bank                Remark 15. It is essential that\n notes to be received in payment  all taxes should be raised, throughout\n of all public customs and        the United States, in specie, or\n taxes, at an equivalent with     Bank notes at par, or the old paper\n gold and silver.                 at its current value at the time of\n                                  payment. This will serve to increase\n                                  the circulation and credit of the Bank\n                                  notes; but no person should be obliged to\n                                  receive them in private dealings. Their\n                                  credit must depend on opinion; and this\n                                  opinion would be injured by legislative\n                                  interposition.\n\n Art. XVI. The Bank to            Remark 16. This permission\n dissolve itself whenever it      to dissolve or sell at pleasure, will\n thinks proper, making effectual  encourage men to adventure; and, when\n provision for the payment of     once engaged, the profits will make them\n its debts; and a proprietor      willing to continue.\n of Bank stock to have the\n privilege of selling out\n whenever he pleases.\n\n Art. XVII. The Bank to           Remark 17. This is chiefly\n be established for thirty years  to prevent some speculative men being\n by way of experiment.            alarmed, who, upon the whole, may think a\n                                  paper credit detrimental and dangerous,\n                                  though they would be willing, from\n                                  necessity, to encourage it for a limited\n                                  time. Experience, too, may show the\n                                  defects of this plan, and give rise to\n                                  alterations for the better.\n\n Art. XVIII. No other             Remark 18. Other Banks might\n Bank, public or private, to be   excite a competition prejudicial to the\n permitted during that period.    interests of this, and multiply and\n                                  diversify paper credit too much.\n\n Art. XIX. Three Banks            Remark 19. These Banks ought\n to be erected in Massachusetts,  to be in the interior of the country,\n Pennsylvania, and Virginia, to   remote from danger, with every precaution\n facilitate the circulation and   for their security in every way. Their\n payment of the Bank notes.       distance from the capital trading points,\n                                  will be an advantage, as it will make\n                                  applications for the payment of Bank\n                                  notes less convenient.\n\n Art. XX. The affairs             Remark 20. It is necessary, for\n of the Bank to be managed by     reciprocal security of the public, the\n twelve general Directors, men    proprietors, and the people, that the\n of reputation and fortune;       affairs of the Bank should be conducted\n eight of them to be chosen       under a joint direction.\n by the private proprietors,\n and four by Congress. The\n Minister of Finance to have the\n privilege of inspecting all\n their proceedings.\n\nThese, as has been already observed, are only intended as outlines;\nthe form of administration for the Bank, and all other matters, may\nbe easily determined, if the leading principles are once approved. We\nshall find good models in the different European Banks, which we can\naccommodate to our circumstances. Great care, in particular, should\nbe employed to guard against counterfeits; and I think methods may be\ndevised that would be effectual.\n\nI see nothing to prevent the practicability of a plan of this kind, but\na distrust of the final success of the war, which may make men afraid\nto risk any considerable part of their fortunes in the public funds;\nbut, without being an enthusiast, I will venture to assert, that, with\nsuch a resource as is here proposed, the loss of our independence is\nimpossible. All we have to fear is, that the want of money may disband\nthe army, or so perplex and enfeeble our operations, as to create in\nthe people a general disgust and alarm, which may make them clamor for\npeace on any terms. But if a judicious administration of our finances,\nassisted by a Bank, takes place, and the ancient security of property\nis restored, no convulsion is to be apprehended. Our opposition will\nsoon assume an aspect of system and vigor, that will relieve and\nencourage the people, and put an end to the hopes of the enemy. âTis\nevident they have it not in their power to subdue us by force of arms.\nIn all these States they have not more than fifteen thousand effective\ntroops, nor is it possible for them much to augment this number. The\nEast and West Indies demand reinforcements. In all the Islands, they\nhave not, at this time, above five thousand men; a force not more\nthan equal to the proper garrisoning of Jamaica alone; and which, the\nmoment they lose a maritime superiority in those seas, will leave them\nmuch cause to fear for their possessions. They will probably send out\nfifteen hundred or two thousand men, to recruit their regiments already\nhere; but this is the utmost they can do.\n\nOur allies have five thousand men at Rhode Island, which, in the worst\nevent that can happen, will be recruited to eight, to co-operate with\nus on a defensive plan. Should our army amount to no more than fifteen\nthousand men, the combined forces, though not equal to the expulsion of\nthe enemy, will be equal to the purpose of compelling them to renounce\ntheir offensive, and content themselves with maintaining one or two\ncapital points. This is on the supposition that the public have the\nmeans of putting their troops in activity. By stopping the progress\nof their conquests, and reducing them to an unmeaning and disgraceful\ndefensive, we destroy the national expectation of success, from which\nthe ministry draw their resources. It is not a vague conjecture, but\na fact founded on the best information, that, had it not been for the\ncapture of Charleston, and the victory of Camden, the ministry would\nhave been in the utmost embarrassment for the supplies of this year.\nOn the credit of those events, they procured a loan of five and twenty\nmillions. They are in a situation where a want of splendid successes\nis ruin. They have carried taxation nearly to its extreme boundary;\nthey have mortgaged all their funds; they have a large unfunded debt,\nbesides the enormous mass which is funded. This must necessarily create\napprehensions in their most sanguine partisans: and if these are not\ncounteracted by flattering events, from time to time, they cannot much\nlonger continue the delusion. Indeed, in this case, I suppose they must\nthemselves despair.\n\nThe game we play is a sure game, if we play it with skill. I have\ncalculated, in the preceding observations, on the most disadvantageous\nside. Many events may turn up, in the course of the summer, to make\neven the present campaign decisive.\n\nIf we compare the real ability of France, for revenue, with that of\nGreat Britain; the economy and sagacity in the conduct of the finances\nof the former; the extravagance and dissipation which are overwhelming\nthose of the latter; there will be found every reason to believe,\nthat the resources of France will outlast those of her adversary. Her\nfleet is not much inferior, independent of that of Spain and Holland.\nCombined with that of Spain, it is greatly superior. If the Dutch enter\ninto the war in earnest, and add their fleet, the superiority will be\nirresistible. Notwithstanding the injury they may sustain in the first\ninstance, the Dutch will be still formidable: they are rich in credit,\nand have extensive means for maritime power.\n\nExcept the Emperor, who is hostile, and the Dane, who is neutral,\nall the rest of Europe are either friends to France or to our\nindependence. Never did a nation unite more circumstances in its favor\nthan we do: we have nothing against us but our own misconduct.\n\nThere are two classes of men among us, equally mistaken: one who, in\nspite of daily experience, of accumulated distress, persist in a narrow\nline of policy, and, amidst the most threatening dangers, fancy every\nthing in perfect security. Another, who, judging too much from the\noutside, alarmed by partial misfortunes, and the disordered state of\nour finances, without estimating the real faculties of the parties,\ngive themselves up to an ignorant and ill-founded despondency. We want\nto learn to appreciate our true situation and that of the enemy. This\nwould preserve us from a stupid insensibility to danger on the one\nhand, and inspire us with a reasonable and enlightened confidence on\nthe other.\n\nBut let us suppose the worst, that we shall, after all, fail in our\nindependence; our return to Great Britain, whenever it should happen,\nwould be by compact. The war would terminate by a mediation. It cannot\nbe supposed that the mediator would be so devoted to Great Britain,\nor would have so little consideration for France, as to oblige us to\nrevert to our former subjection by an unconditional surrender. While\nthey might confirm his dominion over us, they would endeavor to save\nappearances for the honor of France, and stipulate terms as favorable\nto us as would be compatible with a state of dependence. A general\namnesty, and the security of private property (of course the payment of\npublic debts), would be among the most simple and most indispensable.\nThis would comprehend the concerns of the Bank; and if, unfortunately\nfor our virtue, such a circumstance could operate as an inducement,\nit might be added, that our enemies would be glad to find, and to\nencourage such an institution among us for their own benefit.\n\nA question may arise concerning the abilities of these States to pay\ntheir debts after the establishment of their independence; and though\nany doubt on this head must originate in gross ignorance, it may be\nnecessary to oppose it with more than general argument, as has been\ndone heretofore. A very summary and obvious calculation will show that\nthere is nothing to be dreaded on this head.\n\nThe funds of nine hundred and seventy-nine thousand, three hundred and\nthirty-three, and one-third, dollars, proposed to be established for\npaying off the loan of the first year, and for redeeming the present\npaper, will, in thirty years, wipe off all the debts of the States,\nexcept those contracted to foreigners, which, I imagine, do not amount\nto four millions of dollars. Suppose we should be obliged, for two\nyears besides the present, to borrow an equal sum each year from the\nBank; the fund requisite to discharge these loans, on the same terms\nwith the first, will amount to seven hundred and thirty-six thousand\ndollars, to be deducted from the five million, and twenty thousand,\nsix hundred and sixty-six, and two-thirds, dollars, remaining on the\nannual revenue; which will reduce it to four millions, two hundred\nand eighty-four thousand, six hundred and sixty-six, and two-thirds,\ndollars: then the debt unfunded will be,\n\n To foreigners already contracted by supposition,         $4,000,000\n\n Deficiency of Revenue to the expense to be obtained on\n credit, the first year, besides the loan from the Bank,   1,479,333â\n\n Deficiency of Revenue for the second year deducting the\n fund for discharging the loan of this year,               1,847,333â\n\n Deficiency of Revenue for the third year, making the\n same deduction,                                           2,215,333â\n                                                         ----------\n                                                         $9,542,000\n\nShould, then, the war last three years longer, which must probably\nbe the utmost term of its duration, we shall find ourselves with an\nunfunded debt of nine million, five hundred and forty-two thousand\ndollars, and an unappropriated revenue of four million, two hundred\nand eighty-four thousand, six hundred and sixty-six, and two-thirds,\ndollars.\n\nThe surplus of four millions, which is two hundred and eighty-four\nthousand, six hundred and sixty-six, and two-thirds, dollars, and the\nfunds appropriated to the payment of the other debts which will revert\nto the public at the end of thirty years, will be a sufficient fund\nfor the redemption of this debt in about thirty-five years: so that,\naccording to my plan, at the end of thirty-five years these States have\npaid off the whole debt contracted on account of the war; and, in the\nmean time, will have a clear revenue of four millions of dollars, for\ndefraying the expenses of their civil and military establishments.\n\nThis calculation supposes the ability of these States for revenue to\ncontinue the same as they now are, which is a supposition both false\nand unfavorable. Speaking within moderate bounds, our population will\nbe doubled in thirty years; there will be a confluence of emigrants\nfrom all parts of the world; our commerce will have a proportionable\nprogress; and of course our wealth and capacity for revenue. It will be\na matter of choice if we are not out of debt in twenty years, without\nat all encumbering the people.\n\nA national debt, if it is not excessive, will be to us a national\nblessing. It will be a powerful cement of our Union. It will also\ncreate a necessity for keeping up taxation to a degree which, without\nbeing oppressive, will be a spur to industry, remote as we are from\nEurope, and shall be from danger. It were otherwise to be feared our\npopular maxims would incline us to too great parsimony and indulgence.\nWe labor less now than any civilized nation of Europe; and a habit of\nlabor in the people, is as essential to the health and vigor of their\nminds and bodies, as it is conducive to the welfare of the State. We\nought not to suffer our self-love to deceive us in a comparison upon\nthese points.\n\nI have spun out this letter to a much greater length than I intended.\nTo develope the whole connection of my ideas on the subject, and\nplace my plan in the clearest light, I have indulged myself in many\nobservations which might have been omitted. I shall not longer intrude\nupon your patience than to assure you of the sincere sentiments of\nesteem with which I have the honor to be,\n\n                             Sir, your most obedient and humble servant,\n                             A. Hamilton.\n\n\n[12] It is to be feared, too, that this sum is rated too high. Hitherto\nwe have not four hundred men from that State, nor very promising\naccounts of those which may be expected.\n\n[13] The proportion of the European armies, in general, to the national\npopulation, is calculated at one to a hundred. By this rule, supposing\nour population to be two and a half millions, our armies ought to\nconsist of twenty-five thousand men; but the proportion will naturally\nbe less in this country. Our population is more diffused; there is a\ngreater facility of procuring subsistence, fewer poor (and consequently\nfewer of that class of men whose habits, tempers, and circumstances\nlead them to embrace the military life) than in any other country in\nthe world. Hence it is, I say, twenty thousand men are as many as we\nshall be able to raise. Experience justifies this opinion. In the\nfirst paroxysms of enthusiasm our armies were larger. I believe, at\nparticular periods, we have had more than thirty thousand men in the\nfield: but our force has every year diminished, and has been for two\nyears past below the standard I have assigned. Immense efforts have\nbeen made to procure men, but they have not been able to produce more.\nThis shows that our military system is still susceptible of great\nreforms in favor of economy; but we dare not make them, because we\ncannot pay the army. I also said, twenty thousand men would be as many\nas we should stand in need of. The enemy have now less than this number\nwithin the States; and cannot, in the future progress of the war, have\nmore.\n\nAn equal force, with the occasional aid of the militia, will confine\nthem within one or two capital points; and this will be their defeat.\nBut we have a further resource in the troops of our allies. We must\nnot dream of decisive enterprises, unless our allies will assist us\nwith twelve or fifteen thousand land troops, and an undisputed maritime\nsuperiority. Then, with the aid of the militia, drawn out for a few\nmonths, we may undertake and succeed. Our true policy, in the meantime,\nis, to endeavor to form a solid compact force, proportioned to our\nnecessities.\n\n[14] The possibility of making up so large a proportion of specie\nwill depend on foreign assistance. It could hardly be hoped to effect\nit within ourselves, if, as I suppose, there are not more than six\nmillions of dollars in these States. It is true, plate is admitted;\nbut it is uncertain how far this may prove a resource. It were to be\nwished the proportion of specie might be as large as possible: but,\nperhaps, for fear of a failure, it may be advisable to alter the above\nproportions, so as to have, upon the whole, about one-third in specie,\nand two thirds in European funds and landed security.\n\n[15] It may, perhaps, not be impossible to make some profitable\nspeculations on the bullion which the Spaniards are afraid to transport\nfrom South America to Europe.\n\n[16] It is impossible too soon to make some arrangement that will\nenable Congress to put a stop to the further emission.\n\n[17] There is another immense consideration. The proprietors of the\nBank will be the holders of a great part of this paper. They have it in\ntheir power to double the value of it by this plan: which is, in other\nwords, to gain a hundred per cent.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                               De Peysterâs Point, May 2, 1781.\n\nSir:\n\nI am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you by my late application,\nand that you should think there are insuperable obstacles to a\ncompliance with it. Having renounced my expectations, I have no other\ninducement for troubling your Excellency with a second letter, than to\nobviate the appearance of having desired a thing inconsistent with the\ngood of the service, while I was acquainted with the circumstances that\nmade it so.\n\nI was too interested a spectator of what happened in the case of\nMajor MâPherson, not to have remarked, and not to recollect all the\ncircumstances. The opposition turned ostensibly on his being a brevet\nofficer, yet having a command in a corps formed entirely from one line:\nthe propriety of his being employed in a detachment from the army at\nlarge, so far as I remember, was not disputed. In delicacy to Major\nMâPherson, no personal objections were formally made: but in reality\nthey existed, and contributed to the discontent. It was thought a\npeculiar hardship, that a gentleman who had, for a long time, fought\nagainst us, and had not taken part with us till a late period, and when\nour affairs had assumed a more prosperous aspect, should be preferred\nin one of the most honorary commands of the service. Your Excellency\nmust be convinced, that I mention this in no other view than to show\nthe sentiments of the officers at the time, and the whole grounds for\nthe opposition. My esteem for Major MâPherson, and other reasons, make\nit impossible I can have a different intention.\n\nI know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the case of Colonel\nGimat and Major Galvan; but I have understood that it is founded on\ntheir being appointed in the light corps for two successive campaigns.\n\nIt would be uncandid in me, not to acknowledge that I believe a\ndisposition to exclude brevet officers in general from command, has\na great share in the opposition in every instance; and that so far\nit affects my case. But, at the same time, it appears to me, this\nprinciple alone can never be productive of more than momentary murmurs,\nwhere it is not seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am convinced\nthat the Pennsylvania officers, for their own sakes, repented the\nrash steps they had taken; and, on cool reflection, were happy in an\nopportunity to relinquish their menaces of quitting a service to which\nthey were attached by habit, inclination, and interest, as well as by\npatriotism. I believe, too, we shall never have a similar instance\nin the army, unless the practice should be carried to excess. Major\nGalvan, I am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel Gimat will be\nthen the only brevet officer remaining in command. Your Excellency is\nthe best judge of the proper limits; and there can be no doubt, that\nthe rights of particular officers ought to give place to the general\ngood and tranquillity of the service.\n\nI cannot forbear repeating, that my case is peculiar, and dissimilar\nto all the former. It is distinguished by the circumstances I have\nbefore intimated; my early entrance into the service; my having made\nthe campaign of â76, the most disagreeable of the war, at the head of\na company of artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to\na rank, equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I now possess;\nmy having made all the subsequent campaigns in the family of the\nCommander-in-Chief, in a constant course of important and laborious\nservice. These are my pretensions, at this advanced period of the war,\nto being employed in the only way which my situation admits; and I\nimagine they would have their weight in the minds of the officers in\ngeneral. I only urge them a second time, as reasons which will not\nsuffer me to view the matter in the same light with your Excellency, or\nto regard, as impracticable, my appointment in a light corps, should\nthere be one formed. I entreat they may be understood in this sense\nonly. I am incapable of wishing to obtain any object by importunity. I\nassure your Excellency, that I am too well persuaded of your candor,\nto attribute your refusal to any other cause than an apprehension of\ninconveniences that may attend the appointment.\n\n                           I have the honor to be, with perfect respect,\n                           Sir, your most obedât servant,\n                           A. Hamilton.\n\n\nGeneral Washington. P. S. I have used the term brevet in the sense your\nExcellency appears to have understood it in, as signifying, in general,\nall officers not attached to any established corps. Congress seem,\nhowever, to have made a distinction: they only give a kind of warrant\nto those whom they designate as brevet officers. Mine is a regular\ncommission.\n\n\n\n\nLE VICOMTE DE NOAILLES A HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                         Newport, 10 May, 1781.\n\nJe suis certain, mon cher Colonel, de vous faire plaisir en vous\napprenant que votre ami Laurens est arrivÃ© Ã  Paris en bonne santÃ©, aprÃ¨s\nune traversÃ©e favorable. Au dÃ©part de la frÃ©gate La Concorde arrivÃ©e Ã \nBoston avec M. de Barras amiral, qui vient prendre le commandement de\nnotre flotte, et M. le Vicomte de Rochambau, Mr. Laurens avait dÃ©jÃ  eu\nplusieurs confÃ©rences avec nos ministres; il aura Ã©tÃ© bien Ã©coutÃ© et\nbien entendu de celui qui est chargÃ© du departement de la marine, ainsi\nque de notre contrÃ´leur gÃ©nÃ©ral. Ces deux hommes paraissent influer\ninfiniment dans ce moment sur lâopinion du Roi de France et celle du\npeuple; qui finit en France, comme dans tous les pays du monde par\nÃªtre entendue. Vous saurez certainement quels sont les prÃ©paratifs\npour cette campagne; je dÃ©sire que nous puissions dÃ©livrer lâAmÃ©rique\ndes souffrances quâelle Ã©prouve: quoique je ne sois point nÃ© dans un\npays libre mon cher Colonel, je verrai avec plaisir les fondemens que\nvous allez Ã©tablir pour le bonheur et la tranquillitÃ© dâun peuple chez\nlequel toutes les nations de lâEurope auront les mÃªmes droits. Une fois\ncette Ã©poque arrivÃ©e, lâHumanitÃ© jettera avec plaisir ses yeux sur\nlâautre monde, et verra sans envie un peuple qui ne devra son bonheur\nquâÃ  son propre courage. Sâil mâest possible de placer une petite\npierre dans ce vaste edifice, je me trouverai parfaitement heureux.\n\nLe Ministre chargÃ© de gouverner les finances de notre puissance vient\ndâobtenir du roi de France la permission de lui rendre un compte\npublic de son administration depuis cinq ans quâil en a la direction:\ncet exemple, le premier de ce genre a frappÃ© lâEurope dâÃ©tonnement\net dâamiration pour la conduite de ce grand homme; il prouve quâau\ncommencement de son ministÃ¨re les dÃ©penses de lâÃtat excÃ©dait les\nrecettes de 24 millions. Les diffÃ©rentes Ã©conomies quâil a pu Ã©tablir,\nmalgrÃ© la guerre et les frais Ã©normes quâelle exige, a rÃ©tabli non\nseulement lâÃ©quilibre mais mÃªme un bÃ©nÃ©fice de dix millions de rente\nexcÃ©dante et dix sept millions cinq-cent mille livres, employÃ©\nannuellement Ã  des remboursements de rentes perpetuelles. Ce qui\nproduit maintenant 27 millions de rente de plus que de dÃ©pense. La\nmaniÃ¨re Ã©nergique, raisonnÃ©e et claire rend son ouvrage persuasif\naux yeux mÃªmes de ses ennemis. Je compte vous envoyer ce livre par la\npremiÃ¨re occasion et par celle-ci mÃªme, si lâhomme qui vous remettra ma\nlettre veut sâen charger.\n\nJe vous demanderais pardon de mon importunitÃ©, mon cher Colonel, si je\nnâavais pas Ã©tÃ© assez heureux pour vous donner de nouvelles de notre\nami. Je vous prie de ne pas douter de lâextrÃªme plaisir que jâaurai\ndans tous les temps de ma vie Ã  vous prouver combien mon attachement\npour vous est tendre et sincÃ¨re.\n\n                                        Le Vicomte de Noailles.\n\nJe vous prie de prÃ©senter mon respectueux hommage Ã  Son Excellence\nle GÃ©nÃ©ral Washington; il force ses ennemis mÃªmes Ã  lâestimer, et\nlorsquâon lâa vu deux fois il laisse lâimpression du respect le plus\ntendre.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nCARTER TO HAMILTON.\n\n                                         Newport, May 18, 1781.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nM. de Barras arrived a few days since, with the Generalâs son, in\na frigate from France. He has taken the command of the fleet. Seven\nhundred land forces are now embarking, the wind is fair, and they sail\nthis day to meet the convoy expected from France, with provisions and\nrecruits for the regiments here. I fear they will have a very trifling\naugmentation of force, and that this campaign will prove as inactive\nas the last. I imagine you will be with General Washington at the\nconference. You will have the pleasure to see General Chastellux,\nwho will give you this letter. At his return, I expect it will be\ndecided whether the army marches or not: at present it seems a matter\nof great doubt, notwithstanding the preparations which are making.\nI am astonished we hear nothing from the southward. I fear, if the\ndetachment, embarked at New-York, is destined for that quarter, that\nthe enemy will make a considerable progress.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                                Your friend and servant,\n                                                John Carter.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                        Richmond, May 23, 1781.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nI have been long complaining that I had nothing to do; and want of\nemployment was an objection I had to my going to the southward. But\nfor the present, my dear friend, my complaint is quite of an opposite\nnature; and I have so many arrangements to make, so many difficulties\nto combat, so many enemies to deal with, that I am just that much of\na general, as will make me a historian of misfortunes, and nail my\nname upon the ruins of what good folks are pleased to call the army in\nVirginia.\n\nThere is an age past since I heard from you. I acknowledge that, on my\npart, I have not written so often as I ought to have done; but you will\nexcuse this silence in favor of my very embarrassing circumstances.\nHowever remote you may be from your former post of aid-de-camp to the\nCommander-in-Chief, I am sure you are nevertheless acquainted with\nevery transaction at head quarters. My letters have served to your\ninformation, and I shall consequently abstain from repetitions.\n\nOur forced march saved Richmond; Phillips was going down; and thus far\nI was very happy. Phillipsâs return, his landing at Brandon, south side\nof James River, and the unmolested journey of Lord Cornwallis through\nNorth Carolina, made me apprehensive of the storm that was gathering.\nI advanced towards Petersburg, and intended to have established a\ncommunication upon James and Appamatox Rivers. Had Phillips marched to\nHalifax, I was determined to follow him; and should have risked every\nthing rather than to omit making a diversion in favor of Greene. But\nthat army took possession of Petersburg, and obliged me to stick to\nthis side of the river, from whence reinforcements are expected. Both\narmies have formed their junction, and must consist of between four and\nfive thousand men. We have nine hundred continentals. Their infantry\nis near five to one; their cavalry ten to one. Our militia are not\nnumerous, come without arms, and are not used to war. Government wants\nenergy; and there is nothing to enforce the laws. General Greene has\ndirected me to take command in this State; and I must tell, by the way,\nthat his letter is very polite and affectionate. It then became my duty\nto arrange the departments, which I found in the greatest confusion and\nrelaxation. Nothing can be obtained, and yet expenses were enormous.\n\nThe Baron, and the few new levies he could collect, are ordered to\nSouth Carolina. I am glad he goes, as the hatred of the Virginians to\nhim was truly hurtful to the service. Is it not strange that General\nWayneâs detachment cannot be heard of? They are to go to Carolina; but\nshould I want them for a few days, I am at liberty to keep them. This\npermission I will improve, so far as to receive one blow, that, being\nbeat, I may at least be beat with some decency. There are accounts that\nmake Lord Cornwallis very strong: others make him very weak. In this\ncountry there is no getting good intelligence.\n\nI request you will write me, if you approve of my conduct. The command\nof the waters, the superiority in cavalry, and the great disproportion\nof forces, gave the enemy such advantages, that I durst not venture\nout, and listen to my fondness for enterprise. To speak truth, I was\nafraid of myself as much as of the enemy. Independence has rendered me\nthe more cautious, as I know my own warmth. But if the Pennsylvanians\ncome, Lord Cornwallis shall pay something for his victory.\n\nI wish a reinforcement of _light infantry_, to recruit the battalions,\nor a detachment under General Huntington was sent to me. I wish Laurens\nor Sheldon were immediately dispatched with their horse.\n\nCome here, my dear friend, and command our artillery in Virginia. I\nwant your advice and your exertions. If you grant my request, you will\nvastly oblige,\n\n                                                    Your friend,\n                                                    La Fayette.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                    Philadelphia, May 26, 1781.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is some time since I received your performance dated the 30th\nof April last. I have read it with that attention which it justly\ndeserves, and finding many points of it to coincide with my own\nopinions on the subject, it naturally strengthened that confidence\nwhich every man ought to possess, to a certain degree, in his own\njudgment. You will very soon see the plan of a Bank published, and\nsubscriptions opened for its establishment, having already met with the\napprobation of Congress. It only remains for individuals to do their\npart, and a foundation will be laid for the anticipation of taxes and\nfunds, by a paper credit that cannot depreciate.\n\nThe capital proposed falls far short of your idea, and, indeed, far\nshort of what it ought to be; but I am confident, if this is once\naccomplished, the capital may afterwards be increased to almost any\namount. To propose a large sum in the outset, and fail in the attempt\nto raise it, might prove fatal. To begin with what is clearly in our\npower to accomplish, and on that beginning, to establish the credit\nthat will inevitably command the future increase of capital, seems the\nmost certain road to success. I have thought much about interweaving\na landed security with the capital of this Bank, but am apprehensive\nit would convey to the public mind, an idea of paper being circulated\non that credit, and that the Bank, of consequence, must fail in its\npayments, in case of any considerable run on it: and we must expect\nthat its ruin will be attempted, by external and internal foes. I have\ntherefore left that point to the future deliberations of the Directors\nof this Bank, to whom, in due time, I shall communicate your address.\nI esteem myself much your debtor for this piece, not merely on account\nof the personal respect you have been pleased to express, but also on\naccount of your good intentions: and for these, and the pains you have\ntaken, I not only think, but on all proper occasions, shall say, the\npublic are also indebted to you.\n\nMy office is new, and I am young in the execution of it. Communications\nfrom men of genius and abilities will always be acceptable; and yours\nwill always command the attention of, Sir,\n\n                                          Your obedient, humble servant,\n                                          Robert Morris.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                          Albany, May 30, 1781.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor, covering copies of the letters which passed between the\nGeneral and you, I received on Friday last at Saratoga, which I left,\nsomewhat indisposed, on Sunday, and arrived in the evening. The fatigue\nof the journey increased my disorder, which is the quinsy, with so\nmuch rapidity, that before Tuesday morning I was twice bled to prevent\nsuffocation. The inflammation is subsiding, and I have been able to\nswallow a little broth to-day. I propose to attend the Legislature the\nlatter end of the next week, when I shall have the pleasure of seeing\nyou at Fishkill on the Sunday following. I believe you may prepare\nyourself to go to Philadelphia, as there is little doubt but you will\nbe appointed.\n\nThe enemy are arrived at Crown Point: their number not perfectly\nascertained, but I believe about two thousand. It is said they intend\nto fortify there. A rumor prevails that the three companies of Van\nSchaikâs, now to the northward, are to be called down. If so, I shall\ninstantly remove my family and stock from Saratoga, being certain, if I\ndelay it more than four days after the troops move, that the enemy will\npossess themselves of the whole. Adieu.\n\n                                                  I am, dear Sir,\n                                                  Most affectionately\n                                                  And sincerely,\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\n                                                  Ph: Schuyler.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MRS. HAMILTON.\n\n\n                         Camp Near Dobbsâ Ferry, July 10, 1781.\n\nThe day before yesterday I arrived here, but for want of an opportunity\ncould not write any sooner; indeed, I know of none now. Finding when\nI came here, that nothing was said on the subject of a command, I\nwrote the General a letter, and inclosed him my commission. This\nmorning Tilghman came to me in his name, pressed me to retain my\ncommission, with an assurance that he would endeavor, by all means, to\ngive me a command, nearly such as I could have desired in the present\ncircumstances of the army. Though I know you would be happy to hear\nI had rejected this proposal, it is a pleasure my reputation would\nnot permit me to afford you. I consented to retain my commission, and\naccept the command. I quarter, at present, by a very polite and warm\ninvitation, with General Lincoln, and experience from the officers of\nboth armies every mark of esteem. * * *\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                                   Camp, August 7, 1781.\n\nSir:\n\nThe other day I applied to Colonel Tilghman for an order for shoes,\nfor the two companies of levies. He thought, on a general principle,\nit could not be granted; but as from the best of my own recollection,\nconfirmed by inquiry of others, I have reason to believe a distinction\nwas made last campaign in favor of the advanced corps, in the case\nof Cortlandâs regiment, I am induced to submit the matter to your\nExcellency.\n\nYour Excellency is sensible that the service of an advanced corps, must\nbe in general more active than of the line; and that, in a country\nlike this, the article of shoes is indispensable. If the men cannot be\nsupplied, they cannot perform the duty required of them; which will\nmake the service fall heavier upon that part of the corps which is not\nunder the same disability, as well as render a considerable part of\nit of much less utility. I will not add any personal consideration to\nthose which affect the service; though it certainly cannot be a matter\nof indifference to me.\n\nThe men, I am informed, have, in general, received a bounty of about\nthirty pounds each, which is spent. The State makes no provision\nfor them; and the fact is, they cannot supply themselves: they must\ntherefore be destitute if they have not a continental supply.\n\nThe distinction last campaign, was, if I am not mistaken, that shoes\nwere an article of absolute necessity, and therefore to be allowed,\nthough the articles of clothing were refused.\n\n                                            I have the honor to be,\n                                            Very respectfully,\n                                            Your Excellencyâs\n                                            Most obât and humble servât,\n                                            A. Hamilton.\n\nTo General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MRS. HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                           August, 1781.\n\nIn my last letter I informed you that there was a greater prospect of\nactivity now, than there had been heretofore. I did this to prepare\nyour mind for an event which, I am sure, will give you pain. I begged\nyour father, at the same time, to intimate to you, by degrees, the\nprobability of its taking place. I used this method to prevent a\nsurprise, which might be too severe to you. A part of the army, my dear\ngirl, is going to Virginia, and I must, of necessity, be separated at a\nmuch greater distance from my beloved wife. I cannot announce the fatal\nnecessity, without feeling every thing that a fond husband can feel. I\nam unhappy; I am unhappy beyond expression. I am unhappy, because I am\nto be so remote from you; because I am to hear from you less frequently\nthan I am accustomed to do. I am miserable, because I know you will\nbe so; I am wretched at the idea of flying so far from you, without\na single hourâs interview, to tell you all my pains and all my love.\nBut I cannot ask permission to visit you. It might be thought improper\nto leave my corps at such a time, and upon such an occasion. I must\ngo without seeing you--I must go without embracing you;--alas! I must\ngo. But let no idea, other than of the distance we shall be asunder,\ndisquiet you. Though I said the prospects of activity will be greater,\nI said it to give your expectations a different turn, and prepare you\nfor something disagreeable. It is ten to one that our views will be\ndisappointed, by Cornwallis retiring to South Carolina by land. At all\nevents, our operations will be over by the latter end of October, and I\nwill fly to my home. Donât mention I am going to Virginia.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MRS. HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                Head of Elk, September 6, 1781.\n\nYesterday, my lovely wife, I wrote to you, inclosing you a letter in\none to your father, to the care of Mr. Morris. To-morrow the post sets\nout, and to-morrow we embark for Yorktown. I cannot refuse myself\nthe pleasure of writing you a few lines. Constantly uppermost in my\nthoughts and affections, I am happy only when my moments are devoted\nto some office that respects you. I would give the world to be able to\ntell you all I feel and all I wish, but consult your own heart and you\nwill know mine. What a world will soon be between us! To support the\nidea, all my fortitude is insufficient. What must be the case with you,\nwho have the most female of female hearts? I sink at the perspective of\nyour distress, and I look to heaven to be your guardian and supporter.\nCircumstances that have just come to my knowledge, assure me that our\noperations will be expeditious, as well as our success certain. Early\nin November, as I promised you, we shall certainly meet. Cheer yourself\nwith this idea, and with the assurance of never more being separated.\nEvery day confirms me in the intention of renouncing public life, and\ndevoting myself wholly to you. Let others waste their time and their\ntranquillity in a vain pursuit of power and glory; be it my object to\nbe happy in a quiet retreat with my better angel.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                    Albany, September 16, 1781.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nThe mail which was taken a few days ago at Hampton, has probably\ndeprived me of the pleasure of a line from you.\n\nWe are advised, by a letter from Mr. Carter, that General Washington\nembarked with all except the rear division of the French, at the head\nof Elk on the 8th inst.; hence I hope you are now operating against\nCornwallis. It is difficult to judge with precision of your prospects\nat this distance; but matters and appearances are so favorable, that\nthey justify a hope that the operations will be crowned with ample\nsuccess.\n\nThe Legislature of this State is to convene on the 1st of October, at\nPoughkeepsie: delegates are to be chosen: your friends will propose\nyou. If you should be appointed, you will have time to consider,\nwhether to accept or refuse will be most eligible. Should Cornwallis\nand his army fall into our hands, peace may, and probably will, be the\nconsequence. If so, I should most earnestly wish you in Congress: and\nif not, I should still prefer it to your remaining in the army, for\nreasons that are obvious.\n\n                                           I am, dear Sir,\n                                           Affectionately and sincerely,\n                                           Your obedient servant,\n                                           Ph: Schuyler.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO LA FAYETTE.\n\n\n                          Camp Before York Town, Oct. 15, 1781.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to render you an account of the corps under my\ncommand in your attack of last night upon the redoubt on the left\nof the enemyâs lines. Agreeably to your orders we advanced in two\ncolumns with unloaded arms: the right composed of Lieutenant-Colonel\nGimatâs battalion and my own, commanded by Major Fish; the left, of a\ndetachment commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Laurens, destined to take\nthe enemy in reverse, and intercept their retreat. The column on the\nright was preceded by a vanguard of twenty men, led by Lieutenant\nMansfield; and a detachment of sappers and miners, commanded by Captain\nGilliland, for the purpose of removing obstructions.\n\nThe redoubt was commanded by Major Campbell, with a detachment of\nBritish and German troops, and was completely in a state of defence.\n\nThe rapidity and immediate success of the assault are the best comment\non the behavior of the troops. Lieutenant-Colonel Laurens distinguished\nhimself by an exact and vigorous execution of his part of the plan, by\nentering the enemyâs work with his corps among the foremost, and making\nprisoner the commanding officer of the redoubt. Lieutenant-Colonel\nGimatâs battalion, which formed the van of the right-attack, and which\nfell under my immediate observation, encouraged by the decisive and\nanimated example of their leader, advanced with an ardor and resolution\nsuperior to every obstacle. They were well seconded by Major Fish\nwith the battalion under his command, who, when the front of the\ncolumn reached the abatis, unlocking his corps to the left, as he had\nbeen directed, advanced with such celerity as to arrive in time to\nparticipate in the assault.\n\nLieutenant Mansfield deserves particular commendation for the coolness,\nfirmness, and punctuality with which he conducted the vanguard.\nCaptain Olney, who commanded the first platoon of Gimatâs battalion,\nis entitled to peculiar applause. He led his platoon into the work\nwith exemplary intrepidity, and received two bayonet wounds. Captain\nGilliland, with the detachment of sappers and miners, acquitted\nthemselves in a manner that did them great honor.\n\nI do but justice to the several corps when I have the pleasure to\nassure you, there was not an officer nor soldier whose behavior, if\nit could be particularized, would not have a claim to the warmest\napprobation. As it would have been attended with delay and loss, to\nwait for the removal of the abatis and palisades, the ardor of the\ntroops was indulged in passing over them.\n\nThere was a happy coincidence of movements. The redoubt was in the same\nmoment enveloped and carried in every part. The enemy are entitled to\nthe acknowledgment of an honorable defence.\n\nPermit me to have the satisfaction of expressing our obligations to\nCol. Armand, Capt. Legongne, the Chevalier De Fontevieux and Capt.\nBedkin, officers of his corps, who, acting upon this occasion as\nvolunteers, proceeded at the head of the right column, and entering the\nredoubt among the first, by their gallant example contributed to the\nsuccess of the enterprise.\n\nOur killed and wounded you will perceive by the inclosed return. I\nsensibly felt, at a critical period, the loss of the assistance of\nLieutenant-Colonel Gimat, who received a musket ball in his foot, which\nobliged him to retire from the field. Captain Bets, of Laurensâs corps,\nCaptain Hunt and Lieutenant Mansfield, of Gimatâs, were wounded with\nthe bayonet in gallantly entering the work. Captain Kirkpatrick, of the\ncorps of sappers and miners, received a wound in the ditch.\n\nInclosed is a return of the prisoners. The killed and wounded of\nthe enemy did not exceed eight. Incapable of imitating examples of\nbarbarity, and forgetting recent provocations, the soldiery spared\nevery man who ceased to fight.\n\n                                 I have the honor to be,\n                                 With the warmest esteem and attachment,\n                                 Sir, your most obât and humble servât,\n                                 A. Hamilton,\n                                 Lieut. Col. Commanding.\n\n\nMajor-General the Marquis De La Fayette.\n\n Return of the killed and wounded in the advanced corps commanded by\n Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, in an attack on the enemyâs left redoubt,\n on the evening of the 14th of Oct., 1781.\n\nTable Key:\n K = Killed\n W = Wounded\n\n ===================++=======++=======++=======++========++=======++=======\n                    || Lieut.||       ||       ||  Sub-  || Ser-  || Rank &\n                    ||  Col. ||Majors.||Captâs.||alterns.||geants.|| File.\n -------------------++---+---++---+---++---+---++---+----++---+---++---+---\n                    || K | W || K | W || K | W || K | W  || K | W || K | W\n -------------------++---+---++---+---++---+---++---+----++---+---++---+---\n Lt.

On this principle, though I do not think\nthe subject of the inclosed letter of sufficient importance to request\nan official communication of it, yet I should be happy it might in\nsome way be known to the members of that honorable body. Should they\nhereafter learn, that though retained on the list of their officers,\nI am not in the execution of the duties of my station, I wish them\nto be sensible, that it is not a diminution of zeal which induces me\nvoluntarily to withdraw my services, but that I only refrain from\nintruding them, when circumstances seem to have made them either not\nnecessary or not desired; and that I shall not receive emoluments\nwithout performing the conditions to which they were annexed. I also\nwish them to be apprised upon what footing my future continuance in\nthe army is placed; that they may judge how far it is expedient to\npermit it. I therefore take the liberty to request the favor of your\nExcellency to impart the knowledge of my situation in such manner as\nyou think most convenient.\n\n                                           I have the honor to be,\n                                           With perfect respect,\n                                           Your Excellencyâs\n                                           Most obât and humble servant,\n                                           A. Hamilton.\n\nGeneral Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                   Philadelphia, March 1, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nYour Excellency will, I am persuaded, readily admit the force of this\nsentiment, that though it is the duty of a good citizen to devote his\nservices to the public, when it has occasion for them, he cannot, with\npropriety or delicacy to himself, obtrude them when it either has, or\nappears to have none. The difficulties I experienced last campaign in\nobtaining a command, will not suffer me to make any further application\non that head.\n\nAs I have many reasons to consider my being employed hereafter in a\nprecarious light, the bare possibility of rendering an equivalent will\nnot justify, to my scruples, the receiving any future emoluments from\nmy commission. I therefore renounce, from this time, all claim to\nthe compensations attached to my military station during the war, or\nafter it. But I have motives which will not permit me to resolve on\na total resignation. I sincerely hope a prosperous train of affairs\nmay continue to make it no inconvenience to decline the services of\npersons, whose zeal, in worse times, was found not altogether useless:\nbut as the most promising appearances are often reversed by unforeseen\ndisasters, and as unfortunate events may again make the same zeal\nof some value, I am unwilling to put it out of my power to renew my\nexertions in the common cause, in the line in which I have hitherto\nacted.\n\nI shall accordingly retain my rank while I am permitted to do it; and\ntake this opportunity to declare, that I shall be at all times ready\nto obey the call of the public, in any capacity, civil or military\n(consistent with what I owe to myself), in which there may be a\nprospect of my contributing to the final attainment of the object for\nwhich I embarked in the service.\n\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\n                                                 Very respectfully,\n                                                 Your Excellencyâs\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\nGeneral Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MEADE.\n\n\n                                     Philadelphia, March, 1782.\n\nA half hour since brought me the pleasure of your letter of December\nlast. It went to Albany and came from thence to this place. I heartily\nfelicitate you on the birth of your daughter. I can well conceive your\nhappiness on that occasion, by that which I feel on a similar one.\nIndeed, the sensations of a tender father of the child of a beloved\nmother, can only be conceived by those who have experienced them.\n\nYour heart, my Meade, is peculiarly formed for enjoyments of this\nkind. You have every right to be a happy husband--a happy father. You\nhave every prospect of being so. I hope your felicity may never be\ninterrupted.\n\nYou cannot imagine how entirely domestic I am growing. I lose all taste\nfor the pursuits of ambition. I sigh for nothing but the company of\nmy wife and my baby. The ties of duty alone, or imagined duty, keep\nme from renouncing public life altogether. It is, however, probable\nI may not any longer be engaged in it. I have explained to you the\ndifficulties which I met with in obtaining a command last campaign. I\nthought it incompatible with the delicacy due to myself, to make any\napplication this campaign. I have expressed this sentiment in a letter\nto the General, and, retaining my rank only, have relinquished the\nemoluments of my commission, declaring myself, notwithstanding, ready\nat all times to obey the calls of the public. I donât expect to hear\nany of these, unless the state of our affairs should change for the\nworse, and lest by any unforeseen accident that would happen, I choose\nto keep myself in a situation again to contribute my aid. This prevents\na total resignation.\n\nYou were right in supposing I neglected to prepare what I promised you\nat Philadelphia. The truth is, I was in such a hurry to get home that I\ncould think of nothing else. As I set out to-morrow morning for Albany,\nI cannot from this place, send you the matter you wish.\n\nImagine, my dear Meade, what pleasure it must give Eliza and myself\nto know that Mrs. Meade interests herself in us. Without a personal\nacquaintance, we have been long attached to her. My visit at Mr.\nFitzhughâs confirmed my partiality. Betsy is so fond of your family,\nthat she proposes to form a match between her boy and your girl,\nprovided you will engage to make the latter as amiable as her mother.\n\nTruly, my dear Meade, I often regret that fortune has cast our\nresidence at such a distance from each other. It would be a serious\naddition to my happiness if we lived where I could see you every day;\nbut fate has determined it otherwise. I am a little hurried, and can\nonly request, in addition, that you will present me most affectionately\nto Mrs. Meade, and believe me to be,\n\n                                        With the warmest\n                                        And most unalterable friendship,\n                                        Yours,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.[18]\n\n\n                                         Paris, April 12, 1782.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nHowever silent you may please to be, I will nevertheless remind you of\na friend who loves you tenderly, and who, by his attachment, deserves\na great share in your affection. This letter, my dear sir, will be\ndelivered or sent by Count de Segur, an intimate friend of mine, a\nman of wit and of abilities, and whose society you will certainly be\npleased with. I warmly recommend him to you, and hope he will meet from\nyou with more than civilities. Now let us talk politics.\n\nThe old Ministry have retired, and Lord North was not sorry at the\nopportunity. The new ministers are not much our friends: they are not\nfriends to each other: they have some honest men with little sense, and\nsome sensible men without honesty. They are forced to new measures, not\nonly by circumstances, but also by the dispositions they have formerly\nannounced.\n\n_Entre nous seuls._ 81 [_the British Ministry_] gave a hint to 82\n[_the French Ministers_], but it would not do without 54 [_America_].\nNow the reverse will probably be done; after which, arrangements will\ntake place in a few months, and I wish you was here, not so much 205\n[_Secretary to Dr. Franklin_], as to the Commission. However, I would\nlike 205 to be 125 [_Minister to the French Court_]. If you are 153\n[_Member of Congress_], and if something is said to you there, I\nwish you may be employed in the answer. 5 [_French ships_] without 9\n[_Spanish ships_] (and 4 [_Dutch_] is nothing), will not, I fear, give\n40 [_Charleston._] That is a cause of delay, and the 7 [_Spaniards_]\nthink much more of 8 [West Indies]. But I hope for 26 [_Carolina_]\nand 22 [_Georgia_] in 18 [_September_]. 84 [_the King of France_] has\nanswered about 47 [_peace_], as you and I, and every good American,\nmay wish. In the present situation of affairs, I thought my presence\nwas more useful to the cause in this part of the world than it could\nbe on the other side of the Atlantic. I wish to have some matters well\narranged before I go, and then I hope to set sails towards my friends\nin America.\n\nBe pleased, my dear friend, to present my best respects to your lady.\nMy compliments wait on General Schuyler and all the family. Adieu, dear\nHamilton.\n\n                                     With the most sincere attachment,\n                                     I am, for ever,\n                                     Your devoted, affectionate servant,\n                                     La Fayette.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n[18] The _figures_ in the present letter are part of a cipher concerted\nbetween Hamilton and La Fayette. The interpretations, here placed\nbetween brackets, are written over the figures, on the originals, in\nGeneral Hamiltonâs handwriting.--_Editor._\n\n\n\n\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                  Office of Finance, Philadelphia, May 2, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Charles Stewart, late Commissary General of Issue, has informed me\nyou are disposed to quit the military line for the purpose of entering\ninto civil life. He, at the same time, induced me to believe, that you\nwould accept the office of Receiver of the Continental taxes for the\nState of New-York. The intention of this letter is to offer you that\nappointment. The duties of the office will appear, in a great degree,\nfrom the publications made by me on this subject. In addition, it will\nbe necessary that you correspond frequently with me, and give accurate\naccounts of whatever may be passing in your State, which it may be\nnecessary for this office to be acquainted with. But this, and other\nthings of that sort, will be more fully communicated after you have\nsignified your acceptance of the office. For the trouble of executing\nit, I shall allow you one-fourth per cent. on the moneys you receive.\nThe amount of the quota called for from New-York, for the current\nyear, is, as you know, three hundred and seventy-three thousand,\nfive hundred and ninety-eight dollars. I shall be glad to know your\ndetermination as soon as possible. I make to you no professions of my\nconfidence and esteem, because I hope they are unnecessary; but if they\nare, my wish that you would accept the offer I make is the strongest\nevidence I can give of them.\n\n                                       I pray you, Sir, to believe me,\n                                       Very respectfully,\n                                       Your most obât and humble servât,\n                                       Robert Morris.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                          Albany, May 18, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI had this day the honor of receiving your letter of the second\ninstant, and am much obliged by the mark of your confidence which it\ncontains; and to Colonel Stewart for his friendly intentions upon the\noccasion.\n\nMy military situation has indeed become so negative that I have no\nmotive to continue in it; and if my services could be of importance\nto the public in a civil line, I should cheerfully obey its command.\nBut the plan which I have marked out to myself is the profession\nof the law; and I am now engaged in a course of studies for that\npurpose. Time is so precious to me, that I could not put myself in\nthe way of any interruptions, unless for an object of consequence to\nthe public or to myself. The present is not of this nature. Such are\nthe circumstances of this State, the benefit arising from the office\nyou propose would not, during the war, exceed yearly one hundred\npounds; for, unfortunately, I am persuaded it will not pay annually\ninto the Continental treasury above forty thousand pounds; and on a\npeace establishment this will not be for some time to come much more\nthan doubled. You will perceive, sir, that an engagement of this kind\ndoes not correspond with my views, and does not afford sufficient\ninducement to relinquish them. I am not the less sensible of the\nobliging motives which dictated the offer; and it will be an additional\none to that respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be, very\ntruly sir,\n\n                                     Your most obedient, humble servant,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Office of Finance, June 4, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have received your favor of the eighteenth of May. I am much obliged\nby the friendly sentiments you express for me, which, be assured, I\nshall retain a grateful sense of. I see, with you, that the office I\nhad the pleasure of offering, will not be equal to what your abilities\nwill gain in the profession of the law; but I did intend that the whole\nsum should have been paid, although the whole quota of the taxes had\nnot been collected by the State: consequently the object is greater\nthan you supposed, and the business might probably be effected without\nmore attention than you could spare from your studies. If so, I should\nstill be happy in your acceptance; and will leave the matter open until\nI have an opportunity of hearing from you upon the subject.\n\n                                        I pray you to believe that I am,\n                                        With unfeigned esteem,\n                                        Your most obedient servant,\n                                        Robert Morris.\n\n\nColonel Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                         Albany, June 17, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nThe letter which you did me the honor to write me, of the fourth\ninstant, came to my hands too late to permit me to answer it by the\nreturn of the same post. The explanation you give of your intention\nin your late offer, makes it an object that will fully compensate for\nthe time it will deduct from my other occupations. In accepting it, I\nhave only one scruple, arising from a doubt whether the service I can\nrender, in the present state of things, will be an equivalent for the\ncompensation. The whole system (if it may be so called) of taxation\nin this State is radically vicious, burthensome to the people, and\nunproductive to Government. As the matter now stands, there seems to\nbe little for a Continental Receiver to do. The whole business appears\nto be thrown into the hands of the County Treasurers; nor do I find\nthere is any appropriation made of any part of the taxes collected,\nto Continental purposes, or any provision to authorize payment to the\nofficer you appoint: this, however, must be made. There is only one\nway in which I can imagine a prospect of being materially useful;\nthat is, in seconding your applications to the State. In popular\nassemblies much may sometimes be brought about by personal discussions,\nby entering into details, and combating objections as they rise. If\nit should, at any time, be thought advisable by you to empower me to\nact in this capacity, I shall be happy to do every thing that depends\non me to effectuate your views. I flatter myself, to you, sir, I need\nnot profess that I suggest this, not from a desire to augment the\nimportance of office, but to advance the public interest.\n\nIt is of primary moment to me, as soon as possible to take my station\nin the law; and on this consideration I am pressing to qualify myself\nfor admission the next term, which will be the latter end of July.\nAfter this, if you think an interview with me necessary, I will\nwait upon you in Philadelphia. In the mean time, I shall be happy\nto receive your instructions, and shall direct my attention more\nparticularly to acquiring whatever information may be useful to my\nfuture operations. I have read your publications at different times,\nbut as I have not the papers containing them in my possession, it\nwill be necessary that their contents should be comprised in your\ninstructions. A meeting of the Legislature is summoned early in the\nnext month, at which, if I previously receive your orders, it may be\npossible to put matters in train.\n\nI am truly indebted to you, sir, for the disposition you have\nmanifested upon this occasion; and I shall only add an assurance of my\nendeavors to justify your confidence, and prove to you the sincerity of\nthat respectful attachment with which\n\n                                             I am, Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\nTo Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO COMFORT SANDS.\n\n\n                                         Albany, June 22, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Morris having lately offered me the appointment of Receiver of\nContinental taxes for this State, I wish to collect as much and\nas accurate information as possible of the situation of its money\nconcerns. It will be, among other things, of great importance that I\nshould form an idea of the money brought into the State and carried\nout of it; and, with a view to this, I take the liberty to request you\nwill furnish me with an estimate of what you have reason to think you\nwill lay out in this State in the course of a year, in the transactions\nof your contract business. Mr. Duer has been so obliging as to promise\nme a sketch of his disbursements in this quarter, and has informed me\nthat you are principally charged with what relates to the supplies of\nthe main army as well as West Point; and will therefore be best able\nto enlighten me on that head. The calculation may not admit of absolute\nprecision; but if it comes near the truth it will answer. It would be\nuseful that you could distinguish, as nearly as possible, what part\nwill be in specie, what in bank and in other notes. As this is a matter\nthat can be attended with no inconvenience to any person, and will be\nconducive to the public utility, I flatter myself you will favor me\nwith a speedy communication.\n\n                                             I am, with esteem, Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\nTo Comfort Sands, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                          Paris, June 29, 1782.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nHow it happens that I still am in Paris, I hardly can myself conceive;\nand what is more surprising, there are two frigates going, neither\nof which will carry your friend to America. Donât think, however,\ndear Hamilton, I am so much altered as to be kept here by pleasure\nor private affairs. But in the present circumstances, the American\nministers have insisted upon my remaining some time longer at this\ncourt; where, they say, I may render myself more useful to our cause,\nthan I can possibly be in America, during an inactive campaign. My\nreturn, however, is only deferred for a few weeks; and after some\nanswers have arrived from England, which, I think, will discover the\nviews of, but not yet produce a reconciliation with, Great Britain, I\nintend embarking for Philadelphia, where I hope to land in the first\ndays of September.\n\nThis stroke of Count de Grasse has greatly deranged my schemes. I hoped\nfor 40 [_Charleston_] and perhaps for better than that; but nothing\nuntil 6 [_Jamaica_] was done. 40 [_Charleston_] I much expected. 9\n[_the Spaniards_] donât like 54 [_America_]. We must previously have\n40 [_Charleston_]; and then, to put them in good humor, do something\nabout 8 [_West Indies_]; both of which are not yet done; and after\nthat I hope. But at all events, this campaign will be very inactive, I\nthink. However, they are going to take Gibraltar, and will gather so\nmany means of doing of it, that it is said they will succeed. After\nthis trial, the forces of the House of Bourbon will be distributed\nwith a better scale. 46 [_Negotiations_] is going on, and 47 [_Peace_]\nexpected; but not, I think, immediately. You have a good chance, and\nI believe you have time, to be one of the 125 [_Commissioners_].\nJefferson does not come. Mr. Laurens, I am told, intends to return\nhome; and I cannot conceive (_entre nous_) what he is about. Mr. Adams\nthinks his presence is wanting in Holland. I thought I had better give\nyou these intelligences.\n\nNot a word from you since we parted in Virginia; but I am a\ngood-natured man, and will not get tired to speak to a deaf man. Adieu.\n\n                                           Most affectionately,\n                                           Your for ever devoted friend,\n                                           La Fayette.\n\n  To Lieutenant-Colonel\n  Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Office of Finance, July 2, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI yesterday received your letter of the seventeenth of June, and am\nvery happy to find you determined to accept the office I had the\npleasure of offering to you. I inclose the Commission, Instructions,\netc., together with a Bond for performance of the duties, which I must\nrequest you to fill up, execute with some sufficient security, and\ntransmit.\n\nThe complaint you make of the system of taxation in New-York, might, I\nbelieve, very justly be extended; for, though it may be more defective\nin some than in others, it is, I fear, very far from perfect in any.\nI had already heard that no part of the taxes were appropriated to\nContinental purposes; but I expect that the Legislature will, when\nthey meet, make such appropriation, as well as lay new, and, I hope,\nproductive taxes, for the purposes of paying what may remain of their\nquota. It gives me a singular pleasure to find, that you have yourself\npointed out one of the principal objects of your appointment. You will\nfind that it is specified in the inclosure of the fifteenth of April.\nI do not conceive that any interview will be necessary, though I shall\nalways be happy to see you, when your leisure and convenience will\nadmit. In the mean time, I must request you to exert your talents in\nforwarding with your Legislature, the views of Congress. Your former\nsituation in the army, the present situation of that very army, your\nconnections in the State, your perfect knowledge of men and measures,\nand the abilities which heaven has blessed you with, will give you\na fine opportunity to forward the public service, by convincing the\nLegislature of the necessity of copious supplies, and by convincing all\nwho have claims on the justice of Congress, that those claims exist\nonly by that hard necessity which arises from the negligence of the\nStates.\n\nWhen to this, you shall superadd the conviction that what remains of\nthe war, being only a war of finance, solid arrangements of finance\nmust necessarily terminate favorably, not only to our hopes, but even\nto our wishes; then, sir, the Governments will be disposed to lay, and\nthe people to bear, those burthens which are necessary; and then the\nutility of your office, and of the officer, will be as manifest to\nothers as at present to me.\n\n                                                 With perfect respect,\n                                                 Your most obedient\n                                                 And humble servant,\n                                                 Robert Morris.\n\n  Alexander Hamilton, Esq.,\n  Receiver of Taxes for New-York.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                         Albany, July 13, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have this moment received your letter of the second inst., and as the\npost will set out on its return in half an hour, I have little more\nthan time to acknowledge the receipt of it.\n\nI shall, to-morrow morning, commence a journey to Poughkeepsie, where\nthe Legislature are assembled; and I will endeavor, by every step in\nmy power, to second your views; though, I am sorry to add, without\nvery sanguine expectations. I think it probable the Legislature will\ndo something: but whatever momentary effort they may make, till the\nentire change of their present system, very little will be done. To\neffect this, mountains of prejudice and particular interest are to be\nlevelled. For my own part, considering the late serious misfortune\nof our ally, the spirit of reformation, of wisdom, and of unanimity,\nwhich seems to have succeeded to that of blunder, perverseness, and\ndissension in the British Government, and the universal reluctance of\nthese States to do what is right, I cannot help viewing our situation\nas critical: and I feel it the duty of every citizen to exert his\nfaculties to the utmost to support the measures, especially those solid\narrangements of finance on which our safety depends.\n\nI will, by next post, forward you the Bond executed with proper\nsureties.\n\nIt is not in the spirit of compliment, but of sincerity, I assure you,\nthat the opinion I entertain of him who presides in the department,\nwas not one of the smallest motives to my acceptance of the office;\nnor will that esteem and confidence which make me now sensibly feel\nthe obliging expressions of your letter, fail to have a great share in\ninfluencing my future exertions.\n\n                                        I have the honor to be,\n                                        With perfect esteem and respect,\n                                        Your obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOV. CLINTON.\n\n\n                                   Poughkeepsie, July 16, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inclose your Excellency the copy of a warrant from\nthe Honorable Robert Morris, Esq., Superintendent of the Finances of\nthe United States; by which you will perceive that, agreeably to the\nResolution of Congress of the second of November last, he has appointed\nme Receiver of the Continental taxes for this State. I am therefore\nto request that the Legislature will be pleased to vest in me the\nauthority required by that Resolution.\n\nIt is a part of my duty to explain to the Legislature, from time to\ntime, the views of the Superintendent of Finance, in pursuance of the\norders of Congress, that they may be the better enabled to judge of the\nmeasures most proper to be adopted for an effectual co-operation. For\nthis purpose, I pray your Excellency to impart my request, that I may\nhave the honor of a conference with a Committee of the two Houses, at\nsuch time and place as they may find convenient.\n\n                                        I have the honor to be,\n                                        With perfect respect and esteem,\n                                        Your Excellencyâs\n                                        Most obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\nTo his Excellency Governor Clinton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                    Poughkeepsie, May 22, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nAgreeably to my letter to you from Albany, I came to this place, and\nhad an interview with a Committee of the Legislature, in which I\nurged the several matters contained in your instructions. I strongly\nrepresented the necessity of solid arrangements of finance; and, by\nway of argument, pointed out all the defects of the present system. I\nfound every man convinced that something was wrong, but few that were\nwilling to recognize the mischief when defined, and consent to the\nproper remedy. The quantum of taxes already imposed is so great as to\nmake it useless to impose any others to a considerable amount. A bill\nhas, however, passed both Houses, payable in specie, bank notes, or\nyour notes, for eighteen thousand pounds. It is at present appropriated\nto your order; but I doubt whether some subsequent arrangement will not\ntake place for a different appropriation. The Commander-in-Chief has\napplied for a quantity of forage, which the Legislature is devising\nthe means of furnishing; and I fear it will finish by diverting the\neighteen thousand pounds to that purpose. I have hitherto been able to\nprevent this; but as it is of indispensable importance to me to leave\nthis place immediately, to prepare for my examination, for which I have\npledged myself the ensuing term, which is at hand, it is possible,\nafter I have left it, contrary ideas will prevail. Efforts have been\nmade to introduce a species of negotiable certificates, which I have\nstrenuously opposed. It has not yet taken place; but I am not clear how\nthe matter will terminate.\n\nShould the bill for the eighteen thousand pounds go out in its present\nform, I cannot hope that it will produce in the treasury above half the\nsum; such are the vices of our present mode of collection.\n\nA bill has also passed the Assembly for collecting arrearages of taxes,\npayable in specie, bank notes, your notes; old Continental emissions\nat one hundred and twenty-eight for one, and a species of certificates\nissued by the State for the purchase of horses. This is now before the\nSenate. The arrearages are very large.\n\nBoth Houses have unanimously passed a set of resolutions, to be\ntransmitted to Congress and the several States, proposing a Convention\nof the States, to enlarge the powers of Congress and vest them with\nfunds. I think this a very eligible step, though I doubt of the\nconcurrence of the other States; but I am certain, without it, they\nnever will be brought to co-operate in any reasonable or effectual\nplan. Urge reforms, or exertions, and the answer constantly is, What\navails it for one State to make them without the concert of the others?\nIt is in vain to expose the futility of this reasoning: it is founded\nin all those passions which have the strongest influence on the human\nmind.\n\nThe Legislature have also appointed, at my instance, a committee to\ndevise, in its recess, a more effectual system of taxation, and to\ncommunicate with me on this subject. A good deal will depend on the\nsuccess of this attempt. Convinced of the absurdity of multiplying\ntaxes in the present mode, where, in effect, the payment is voluntary,\nand the money received exhausted in the collection, I have labored\nchiefly to instil the necessity of a change in the plan; and, though\nnot so rapidly as the exigency of public affairs requires, truth seems\nto be making some progress.\n\nThere is no other appropriation to the use of Congress than of the\neighteen thousand pounds.\n\nI shall, as soon as possible, give you a full and just view of the\nsituation and temper of this State. This cannot be till after my\nintended examination: that over, I shall lay myself out in every way\nthat can promote your views and the public good.\n\nI am informed you have an appointment to make of a Commissioner of\nAccounts for this State. Permit me to suggest the expediency of\nchoosing a citizen of the State; a man who, to the qualifications\nrequisite for the execution of the office, adds an influence in its\naffairs. I need not particularize the reasons of this suggestion. In my\nnext I will also take the liberty to mention some characters.\n\nI omitted mentioning that the two Houses have also passed a bill,\nauthorizing Congress to adjust the quotas of the States on equitable\nprinciples, agreeably to your recommendation.\n\n                                    I have the honor to be,\n                                    With sincere attachment and respect,\n                                    Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                    A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO COLONEL HAY.\n\n\n                                        Albany, August 3, 1782.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Morris, some time since, in a circular letter to the States,\namong other things, requested to have an account of all the money,\nprovisions, transportations, etc., furnished by this State to the\nUnited States, since the eighteenth of March, seventeen hundred and\neighty.\n\nI have been very happy to hear, that this business has been intrusted\nto your hands: for I am sure, feeling its importance, you will give it\nall the dispatch in your power.\n\nI have written to the Governor on the subject; but, lest other\noccupations should delay his attention to it, I must request you to\ninform me, precisely, what part of the matter has been intrusted to\nyour management, and what progress you have been able to make.\n\nI shall also thank you to send me the amount of any certificates, or\npaper money in any shape, which, through your office, have passed into\ncirculation, distinguishing the different species.\n\nYou will do me a favor by letting me hear from you as soon as possible.\n\n                                              I am, with sincere esteem,\n                                              Your obedient servant,\n                                              A. Hamilton.\n\nP. S. I must still trouble you with an additional request, which is,\nthat you let me know, as exactly as possible, the gross product of each\nsupply-bill in your department in specie value, and the amount of all\nexpenses on each. This I want, with a view to the subjects we have been\nspeaking of.\n\n                                                                   A. H.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\n\n\n                                        Albany, August 8, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have lately received a letter from the Superintendent of Finance,\ninclosing a copy of a circular letter from him to the several States,\ndated twenty-fifth July, â81, in which he requests information on the\nfollowing important points.\n\nâWhat supplies, of every kind, money, provisions, forage,\ntransportation, etc., have been furnished by this State to the United\nStates, since the eighteenth of March, 1780.â\n\nâThe amount of the money in the treasury: the sums expected to be\nthere; the times they will probably be brought in; the appropriations.â\n\nâThe amount of the different paper currencies in the State; the\nprobable increase, or decrease, of each; and the respective rates of\ndepreciation.â\n\nâThe Acts passed since the eighteenth of March, 1780, for raising\ntaxes, furnishing supplies, etc.; the manner they have been executed;\nthe time necessary for them to operate; the consequences of their\noperation; the policy of the State relative to laying, assessing,\nlevying, and collecting taxes.â\n\nIn his letter, which is _circular_, to the Receivers, he says the\nanswers he has received to these inquiries are few and short of the\nobject; and he therefore urges me to take the most speedy and effectual\nmeans, in my power, to enable him to form a proper judgment on such\nof the subjects referred to, as the actual state of things renders it\nimportant to know.\n\nIn compliance with this, I request the favor of your Excellency to\ninform me, what steps have been taken on the several heads of which the\nabove is an abstract: and what progress has been made in the business;\nparticularly with respect to the first article. I shall also be much\nobliged to you to direct Mr. Holt to furnish me, without delay, with\nthe Acts mentioned in the inclosed list.\n\nYour Excellency must have been too sensible of the necessity of\nenabling the Director of the Finances of the United States to form a\njust judgment of the true state of our affairs, to have omitted any\nmeasure in your power to procure the fullest information on the several\nmatters submitted to you: and I am persuaded the business is in such a\ntrain that little will be left for me to do.\n\nI entreat you will do me the honor to let me hear from you as soon as\npossible on the subject.\n\nIt would promote the public business, if you would be so good as to\ndirect Mr. Banker to supply me with such information as I might call\nupon him for. He is very obliging, but without some authority for the\npurpose, there is a delicacy in calling upon him. I wrote at the same\ntime to Mr. Holt, printer for the State, desiring him to forward me\nthe copies of the Acts above mentioned; and telling him, that if the\nGovernor did not make satisfaction, I would do it. These Acts were all\nthose relative to finance and supply, from March eighteenth, 1780, to\nthis time.\n\n                                                  With perfect respect,\n                                                  I am your Excellencyâs\n                                                  Most obedient servant,\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\n\nTo His Excellency Governor Clinton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THE COUNTY TREASURERS.\n\n\n                                      Albany, August 5th, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nIt will be of great utility to the State, and essential to the\nexecution of my instructions from the Superintendent of Finance, that\nI should be able to ascertain, as speedily as possible, the expense\nattending the collection of taxes within this State. In order to this,\nI shall be much obliged to you to send me without delay an account of\nwhat you have received in your county, since the beginning of the\nyear â80 to this time, as well for the taxes laid for county purposes,\nas for those imposed by the Legislature; and of the expenses of every\nkind attending the collection; those of the supervisors, assessors, the\nallowance to the collectors and to yourself.\n\nWhen I assure you I want this information for an important purpose, I\ndoubt not you will forward it to me as speedily as it can be prepared,\nand with as much accuracy as circumstances will permit; by doing which,\nyou will serve the public and oblige, Sir,\n\n                                Your most obedient servant,\n                                A. Hamilton,\n                                Receiver of C. S. for the State of N. Y.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                                        August 13, 1782.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe speculation of evils, from the claims of Great Britain, gives\nway to the pressure of inconveniences actually suffered; and we\nrequired the event which has lately happened, the recognition of our\nindependence by the Dutch, to give a new spring to the public hopes and\nthe public passions. This has had a good effect. And if the Legislature\ncan be brought to adopt a wise plan for its finances, we may put the\npeople in better humor, and give a more regular and durable movement to\nthe machine. The people of this State, as far as my observation goes,\nhave as much firmness in their make, and as much submissiveness to\nGovernment, as those of any part of the Union.\n\nIt remains for me to give you an explicit opinion of what it is\npracticable for this State to do. Even with a judicious plan of\ntaxation, I do not think the State can afford, or the people will bear\nto pay, more than seventy or eighty thousand pounds a year. In its\nentire and flourishing state, according to my mode of calculating,\nit could not have exceeded two hundred and thirty or forty thousand\npounds; and, reduced as it is, with the wheels of circulation so\nexceedingly clogged for want of commerce and a sufficient medium,\nmore than I have said cannot be expected. Passed experience will not\nauthorize a more flattering conclusion.\n\nOut of this is to be deducted the expense of the interior\nadministration of Government, and the money necessary for the levies\nof men. The first amounts to about twelve thousand pounds, as you will\nperceive by the inclosed statement; but I suppose the Legislature\nwould choose to retain fifteen thousand pounds. The money hitherto\nyearly expended in recruits, has amounted to between twenty and\nthirty thousand pounds; but, on a proper plan, ten thousand pounds\nmight suffice. There would then remain forty thousand pounds for your\ndepartment.\n\nBut this is on the supposition of a change of system; for, with the\npresent, I doubt there being paid into the Continental treasury\none-third the sum.\n\nI am endeavoring to collect materials for greater certainty upon this\nsubject; but the business of supplies has been so diversified, lodged\nin such a variety of independent hands, and so carelessly transacted,\nthat it is hardly possible to get any tolerable idea of the gross\nand net product. With the help of these materials I shall strive to\nconvince the committee, when they meet, that a change of measures is\nessential. If they enter cordially into right views, we may succeed:\nbut I confess I fear more than I hope.\n\nI have taken every step in my power to procure the information you have\ndesired in your letter of July â81; the most material part of it, an\naccount of the supplies furnished since March seventeen hundred and\neighty, has been committed to Colonel Hay. I have written to him, in\npressing terms, to accelerate the preparation.\n\nYou will perceive, sir, I have neither flattered the State, nor\nencouraged high expectations. I thought it my duty to exhibit things as\nthey are, not as they ought to be. I shall be sorry if it give an ill\nopinion of the State, for want of equal candor in the representation\nof others; for, however disagreeable the reflection, I have too much\nreason to believe, that the true picture of other States would be,\nin proportion to their circumstances, equally unpromising. All my\ninquiries, and all that appears, induces this opinion. I intend this\nletter _in confidence_ to yourself, and therefore I endorse it private.\n\nBefore I conclude, I will say a word on a point that possibly you\nwould wish to be informed about. The contract up this way is executed\ngenerously to the satisfaction of officers and soldiers; which is the\nmore meritorious in the contractor, as, in all probability, it will be\nto him a losing undertaking.\n\n                                  I have the honor to be,\n                                  With sentiments of unfeigned respect,\n                                  Sir, your most obât and humble servât,\n                                  A. Hamilton.\n\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNOR CLINTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                 Poughkeepsie, August 18, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have received your letter of the third instant. I am not authorized\nto direct the printer to deliver any of the laws, except a certain\nnumber of sets which are by law directed for particular purposes. I\nhave, however, mentioned your desire to the gentlemen of the committee\nappointed to superintend the printing and distribution of them, and\nrequested them to furnish you with a set, which I doubt not will be\ncomplied with.\n\nSome short time before the appointment of a Superintendent of Finance,\nI transmitted to Congress the most perfect information I was able to\ncollect, of many of the matters mentioned in your letter; and it was my\nintention, from time to time, to have continued these communications\nto Mr. Morris; but our laws remaining so long unprinted, the dispersed\nsituation of the different public officers, and the difficulty,\nfrom this circumstance, as well as the want of authority, in some\ninstances, to command the necessary returns, rendered it a business,\nif not impracticable, requiring more time and attention than the\nindispensable duties of my office afforded leisure to bestow. I shall,\nhowever, be happy to give you every aid in my power to facilitate it.\nThe laws, with the returns which have lately been made by the different\npublic officers, and may be found on the files of the Legislature, and\nin the treasurerâs office, will answer most of the questions stated.\nThe answers to the others, appear to me to depend, in some measure,\non matter of opinion; and, as the operation of our laws is often\nobstructed, and the intended consequences defeated, by unforeseen\nevents arising from our embarrassed situation, they cannot be given\nwith any great degree of precision.\n\nYou will readily perceive, sir, that the treasurer, from the nature of\nhis office, is not, except in cases provided for by law, subject to my\ncontrol. I am persuaded, however, that he, as well as the clerks of the\nLegislature, will readily give you every information and assistance\nconsistent with the duties of their respective offices.\n\n                                    I am, with great respect and esteem,\n                                    Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                    Geo. Clinton.\n\nTo Col. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nPICKERING TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                  New-Windsor, August 20, 1782.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have some Bills of Exchange, drawn by Mr. Morris on John Swanwick,\nwhich I am authorized to exchange with the receivers of the Continental\nTaxes in any of the States eastward of Pennsylvania. Mr. Morris\ninformed me, that he had advised the Receivers of this measure, and\ndirected their taking up the bills whenever they were in cash. By taxes\nor by loan, I expect this State will shortly furnish you with money. I\nam indebted to the subjects of it by many special engagements, which I\nam anxious to fulfil. You will therefore greatly oblige me, by giving\nme, from time to time, information of the money you shall receive; and\nin order to secure the earliest supply, I would lodge, if you please,\nsome of the bills in your hands. Bank notes or Mr. Morrisâs notes will\nbe useful to me, though not so beneficial as cash.\n\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\n                                             With respect and esteem,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             Tim. Pickering,\n                                             _Q. M. G._\n\nCol. Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                       Albany, August 25, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nThis letter serves only to transmit the two last papers. I wish the\nmeasures I have taken to satisfy you on the points you desire to be\ninformed of, had been attended with so much success as to enable me\nnow to transmit the result. But I find a singular confusion in the\naccounts kept by the public officers from whom I must necessarily\nderive my information, and a singular dilatoriness in complying with\nmy application, partly from indolence, and partly from jealousy of the\noffice. I hope, by the next post, to transmit you information on some\nparticulars.\n\n                                            I have the honor to be, Sir,\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\n                                            A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MEADE.\n\n\n                                       Albany, August 27, 1782.\n\nI thank you, my dear Meade, for your letter of the first of this month,\nwhich you will perceive has travelled much faster than has been usual\nwith our letters. Our correspondence, hitherto, has been unfortunate;\nnor, in fact, can either of us compliment himself on his punctuality;\nbut you were right in concluding, that however indolence, or accident,\nmay interrupt our intercourse, nothing will interrupt our friendship.\nMine for you is built on the solid basis of a full conviction that you\ndeserve it, and that it is reciprocal; and it is the more firmly fixed\nbecause you have few competitors. Experience is a continual comment on\nthe worthlessness of the human race; and the few exceptions we find\nhave the greater right to be valued in proportion as they are rare. I\nknow few men estimable, fewer amiable; and when I meet with one of the\nlast description, it is not in my power to withhold my affection.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs to myself, I shall sit down in New-York when it opens; and this\nperiod, we are told, approaches. No man looks forward to a peace with\nmore pleasure than I do; though no man would sacrifice less to it than\nmyself, if I were not convinced the people sigh for peace.\n\nI have been studying the law for some months, and have lately been\nlicensed as an attorney. I wish to prepare myself by October for\nexamination as a counsellor; but some public avocation may possibly\nprevent me.\n\nI had almost forgotten to tell you, that I have been pretty unanimously\nelected, by the Legislature of this State, a member of Congress, to\nbegin to serve in November. I do not hope to reform the State, although\nI shall endeavor to do all the good I\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                                   God bless you,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo Colonel Meade.\n\n\n\n\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                            Office of Finance, August 28, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have duly received your several favors of the twenty-second and\ntwenty-seventh of July, and tenth and thirteenth of August. My not\nanswering them is owing to causes which you will easily conceive,\nbecause you will easily conceive the multiplicity of objects to which\nI must turn my attention. I am very sorry to learn that you can no\nlonger continue in the office of Receiver. It would have given me great\npleasure that you should have done so, because I am sure that you would\nhave rendered very signal service to the public cause: this you will\nnow do in another line, more important, as it is more extensive: and\nthe justness of your sentiments on public affairs, induces my warm\nwish, that you may find a place in Congress so agreeable as that you\nmay be induced to continue in it.\n\nI should readily have complied with your wish, as to a successor, but\nthere are many reasons which have called my attention to, and fixed\nmy choice upon, Doctor Tillotson. We will converse on this subject\nwhen we meet. I am, however, very far from being unmindful of your\nrecommendations; and although I cannot name the citizen of any State\nto settle the accounts of that particular State, consistently with\nthe general line of conduct I have laid down for myself; yet I shall\ndo, in other respects, what is in my power. I have not hitherto been\nable to fix on a proper Commissioner for the State of New-York. The\noffice is vacant for New Hampshire and Rhode Island. I inclose you a\ncopy of the Ordinance on the subject, that you may know the powers,\nduties, and emoluments; and I have to request that you offer these\nplaces to Colonel Malcolm and Mr. Lawrence. You will make the first\noffer, including the choice, as your own judgment may direct. Should\nthe gentlemen, or either of them, accept, you will be so kind as to\ngive me early notice. I will then immediately recommend them to the\nStates respectively; and on receiving their approbation, the proper\ninstructions, etc., can be expedited.\n\nI am sorry to learn that any letter of mine should have given offence;\nbut I conclude that this effect must follow from many parts of my\nwritings and conduct; because the steady pursuit of what appears to\nbe the true line of duty, will necessarily cross the various oblique\nviews of interest and opinion. To offend is sometimes a fault, always\na misfortune. The letter in question is, I suppose, under the date of\nthe eleventh of December, of which I inclose you a copy. Let me, at\nthe same time, assure you, that in all your excellent letter of the\nthirteenth instant, I most esteem the clause now in question; because\nit contains that useful information which is least common. I will make\nno apologies for the letter to any one, because apologies are rarely\nuseful; and where the intention has been good, they are, to candid\nminds, unnecessary. Possessed of the facts, you can guard against\nmisrepresentation; and I have ever found that to be the most hostile\nweapon which either my personal or political enemies have been able to\nwield against me.\n\nI have not, _even yet_, seen the Resolutions of your Legislature\nrelative to an extension of the powers of Congress. I had supposed\nthe same reason for them which you have expressed. Indeed, power is\ngenerally such a darling object with weak minds, that they must feel\nextreme reluctance to bid it farewell; neither do I believe that any\nthing will induce a general consent to part with it, but a perfect\nsense of absolute necessity. This may arise from two sources; the one\nof reason, and the other of feeling: the former more safe and more\nuncertain; the latter always severe and often dangerous. It is, my dear\nsir, in circumstances like this, that a patriot mind, seeking the great\ngood of the whole, on enlightened principles, can best be distinguished\nfrom those vulgar souls whose narrow optics can see but the little\ncircle of selfish concerns. Unhappily, such souls are but too common,\nand but too often fill the seats of dignity and authority. A firm,\nwise, manly system of federal government is what I once wished, what I\nnow hope, what I dare not expect, but what I will not despair of. Your\ndescription of the mode of collecting taxes, contains an epitome of the\nfollies which prevail from one end of the continent to the other. There\nis no end to the absurdity of human nature. Mankind seem to delight in\ncontrast and paradox; for surely nothing else could sanctify (during\na contest on the precise point of being taxed by our own consent) the\narbitrary policy which, on this subject, almost universally prevails.\nGod grant you success in your views to amend it. Your ideas on the\nsubject are perfectly correspondent to my own. As to your doubt on the\nmode of collecting it, I would wish to obviate it by the observation,\nthat the farther off we can remove the appointment of Collectors from\npopular influence, the more effectual will be their operations; and\nthe more they conform to the views of Congress, the more effectually\nwill they enable that body to provide for general defence. In political\nlife, the creature will generally pay some deference to both. The\nhaving a double set of officers is indeed an evil; but a good thing is\nnot always to be rejected because of that necessary portion of evil\nwhich, in the course of things, must be attached to it. Neither is this\na necessary evil; for, with a proper Federal Government, Army, Navy,\nand Revenue, the Civil Administration might well be provided for by a\nStamp Act, Roads by Turnpikes, and Navigations by Tolls.\n\nThe account you give of the State is by no means flattering: and\nthe more true it appears, the more concern it gives me. The loan, I\nhope, will be completed; and I wish the _whole_ amount of the tax\nmay be collected. The Forage plan I have disagreed to; and inclose,\nfor your information, the copy of my letter, on that subject, to the\nQuartermaster General. I believe your State is exhausted: but perhaps\neven you consider it as being more so than it is. The Certificates,\nwhich now form a useless load, will (if the United States adopt,\nand the several States agree to, a plan now before Congress) become\nvaluable property. This will afford great relief. The scarcity of\nmoney, also, may be immediately relieved, if the love of popular\nfavor would so far give way to the love of public good, as to enforce\nplentiful taxation. The necessity of having money will always produce\nmoney. The desire of having it, produces, you see, so much as is\nnecessary to gratify the desire of enjoying foreign luxuries. Turn\nthe stream, which now flows in the channels of Commerce, to those of\nRevenue, and the business is completed. Unfortunately for us, this is\nan operation which requires fortitude, perseverance, virtue; and which\ncannot be effected by the weak or wicked minds who have only partial,\nprivate, or interested views.\n\nWhen I consider the exertions which the country you possess has already\nmade, under striking disadvantages, and with astonishing prodigality of\nnational wealth, by pernicious modes of applying it; I persuade myself,\nthat regular, consistent efforts, would produce much more than you\nsuppose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                             I am, with perfect respect,\n                                             Your most obedient\n                                             And humble servant,\n                                             Robert Morris.\n\nTo Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\n\n\n                                       Albany, August 31, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI send you herewith all the acts of the Legislature of this State\nsince the Government has been organized; on the margin of which I have\nnumbered all the acts relative to the matters you mention in your\nletter of July, â81, to the States agreeable to the within list. I\ninclose you the papers of the last week.\n\nThe indolence of some, and the repugnancy of others, make every trifle\nlag so much in the execution, that I am not able at this time to give\nyou any further information. I wish to hear from you on the subject of\nmy former letters previous to the meeting of the Committee--the 15th of\nthe ensuing month.\n\n                                      I have the honor to be very truly,\n                                      Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                      A. H.\n\nTo the Honorable Superintendent of Finance.\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNOR CLINTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Poughkeepsie, September 2, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI am favored with your letter of the 25th instant, previous to which,\nwith a view of accelerating the collection of the last Tax, I had\nprepared, and have since dispatched a circular letter to the several\nCounty Treasurers, urging them and the other officers concerned, to a\nprompt execution of their duty, or that in case of neglect the penalty\nof the law will without favor be put into execution.\n\nI have not received information from all the Counties, but in this and\nsome others, I know the business is in good train, and am led to hope\nthat the taxes will be speedily collected and paid in.\n\nMy agents employed to procure moneys on loan had some time since\ntransmitted me a small sum, but not sufficient to answer the orders\nof the Legislature in favor of the Delegates and some other public\nmatters. As the channel through which this money is procured is subject\nto interruption and disappointment, I cannot at present inform you of\nany sum to be depended on, but I expect soon to see or hear from the\ngentlemen, and you may rest assured of being informed of the result\nwithout delay.\n\n                                    I am, with great respect and esteem,\n                                    Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                    Geo. Clinton.\n\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THE COUNTY TREASURERS.\n\n\n                                     Albany, September 7, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nThe fifteenth of this month is the period fixed for the payment of\nthe tax imposed at the last meeting of the Legislature for the use of\nthe United States. The public exigencies, and the reputation of the\nState, require that every exertion should be made to collect this tax\nwith punctuality and dispatch; and it is, therefore, my duty to urge\nyou, that you employ the powers vested in you, and all your personal\ninfluence, to induce the collectors to expedite the collection with all\nthe zeal and vigor in their power. While the other States are all doing\nsomething, as a citizen of this, I shall feel a sensible mortification\nin being obliged to continue publishing to the others, that this\nState pays nothing in support of the war, as I have been under the\nnecessity of doing the last two months. Besides this, and other still\nmore weighty considerations, a regard to the subjects of the State\nitself demands every exertion in our power. They have parted with their\nproperty on the public faith, and it is impossible for the public to\nfulfil its engagements to individuals, unless it is enabled to do it by\nthe equal and just contributions of the community at large.\n\n                                             I am, Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                     Albany, September 7, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have had the inclosed ready for some time; but in hopes of receiving\nthe returns of the certificates mentioned in memorandum B, I delayed\nsending the present sketch. Having even received no answers from some\nof the parties, who live at a distance from me, I suspect they have\ndone their business in so disorderly a manner (to say nothing worse of\nit) that they are at a loss how to render the accounts; and I have,\ntherefore, concluded not to detain any longer what I have procured.\n\nI do not take the step mentioned in memorandum A, because I doubted\nits propriety. It might raise expectations about the old money, which,\npossibly, it may not enter into your plans to raise: and, besides\nthis, by knowing what has been called in, in each State (which from\nthe sketch I send you, will appear as to this), you can determine the\nbalance of emissions remaining out, except what may have worn out and\nbeen accidentally destroyed. If you desire this step to be taken, I\nwill obey your commands.\n\nI have said nothing of the rates of depreciation, because I imagine\nyour letter, written in July, â80, had reference to the rates at which\nthe money was then actually circulating, and the circulation has now\ntotally ceased. The laws I sent you by the last post, will inform you\nof the rates fixed at different periods by the Legislature: forty,\nseventy-five, and lastly, one hundred and twenty-eight. I am obliged to\ninfer there is a studied backwardness in the officers of the State, who\nought to give me the information you require respecting the supplies\nof different kinds which have been furnished to the use of the United\nStates. Indeed, I find, on inquiry, that their joint information will\nnot be so full as to satisfy your intentions; and that this cannot be\ndone till you have appointed a commissioner of accounts, authorized to\nenter into all the details, aided by some legislative arrangement which\nmay be obtained the next session.\n\n                                        I have the honor to be,\n                                        With great respect and esteem,\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO TIMOTHY PICKERING.\n\n\n                                     Albany, September 7, 1782.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI this day received your letter of the 20th August. Mr. Morris has\nadvised me of the bills you describe, and directed my purchasing them,\ntogether with his notes, and the bank notes; with what money shall come\ninto my hands on public account. They are now beginning to collect the\ntax imposed for the use of the United States, though I can as yet form\nno judgment with what success or expedition. I shall with pleasure give\nyou the information you ask, but I would rather wish to be excused from\nanticipation by previous deposits in my hands, as that will in some\nmeasure pledge me to give a preference to the bills deposited, and may\nhereafter expose me to a charge of partiality. There have been several\napplications to me for a similar anticipation which I have avoided;\nreserving to myself the power of paying the bills as they shall be\npresented, and in proportion to the nearness or remoteness of the\nperiods of payments.\n\nYou may, however, depend that I shall be happy to assist your\ndepartment, and will keep in view your present request. I hope, towards\nthe latter end of the month, I shall receive something considerable on\nthe late tax.\n\n                                             I am, dear Sir, very truly,\n                                             Your obedient servant,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\n  To Timothy Pickering,\n  D. Q. Gen.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\n\n\n                                        Albany, Sept. 14, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th\nof August, the contents of which shall be executed.\n\nI have just received by the post accounts of the specific supplies\nfurnished by the State; copies of which I shall prepare to be\ntransmitted to you by the next post, as I am to return the originals,\nwhich are for the inspection of the Legislature. I hope to add to these\naccounts of the moneys supplied.\n\nI have written to you a number of letters since my journey to\nPoughkeepsie, of which, as they contain some things of a confidential\nnature, I am not without anxiety to learn the safe arrival.\n\nI should also have been happy to have received your instructions\nagainst the meeting of the Committee, which is to take place to-morrow.\nAs they will have other business, if I hear from you by the next post,\nI shall not be too late. I am at a loss to know whether I ought to\npress the establishment of permanent _funds_ or not; though unless I\nreceive your instructions, following my own apprehensions of what are\nprobably your views, I shall dwell on this article.\n\n                                             I have the honor to be,\n                                             With perfect respect,\n                                             Sir, your most obât servât,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\nI inclose you a copy of a letter of the Governor, of the 2d inst., from\nwhich you will see his hopes. Mine are not so good. In this vicinity,\nalways delinquent, little is doing.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\n\n\n                                        Albany, Sept. 21, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nThe hurry in which I wrote to you by the last post, prevented my\nexamining particularly the papers which I informed you I had received.\nOn a more careful inspection of them, I found them not so complete as\nI had hoped. There is a general state of specific supplies; but the\nreturns referred to in that for the particulars, were by some mistake\nomitted. I have written for them, but they have not yet arrived; when\nthey do, I shall lose no time in forwarding them.\n\nI observe there is nothing respecting transportation; and there is a\npart of the supplies for the period before Col. Hay came into office,\nwhich is estimated on a scale of proportion--too vague a method\nto be satisfactory. I have urged him to send me an account of the\ntransportation, and to collect, as speedily as possible, official\nreturns of the supplies above mentioned.\n\nThere is a practice obtaining which appears to me to contravene your\nviews. The Contractors, I am informed, have gotten into a method of\ncarrying your bills immediately to the Collectors and drawing the\nspecie out of their hands, by which means the paper never goes into\ncirculation at all; but passes, so to speak, immediately out of one\nhand of the public into the other. The people, therefore, can never be\nfamiliarized to the paper, nor can it ever obtain a general currency.\n\nIf the specie were to come into the Receiversâ hands, and the\nContractors were left under a necessity of exerting their influence to\ninduce the inhabitants to take your notes, to be afterwards redeemed by\nthe Receivers agreeably to your plan, this would gradually accustom the\npeople to place confidence in the notes; and though the circulation at\nfirst should be momentary, it might come to be more permanent.\n\nI am in doubt, whether on the mere speculation of an evil, without your\ninstructions, I ought to take any step to prevent this practice. For,\nshould I forbid the exchange, it might possibly cause a suspicion that\nthere was a preference of the paper to the specie, which might injure\nits credit.\n\nI have thought of a method to prevent, without forbidding it in direct\nterms. This was to require each collector to return the names of the\npersons from whom he received taxes, and in different columns, specify\nthe kind of money, whether specie, your notes, or bank notes, in which\nthe tax was paid; giving the inhabitants receipts accordingly; and\npaying in money in the same species in which it was received. This\nwould cover the object.\n\nI have tried to prevail upon the county treasurer of this place, to\ninstruct the collectors accordingly; but the great aim of all these\npeople is to avoid trouble; and he affected to consider the matter as a\nHerculean labor. Nor will it be done without a legislative injunction.\n\nA method of this kind would tend much to check fraud in the collectors;\nand would have many good consequences.\n\nI thought it my duty, at any rate, to apprise you of the practice,\nthat, if my apprehensions are right, it may not be continued without\ncontrol. I have reason to believe it is very extensive--by no means\nconfined to this State.\n\nPermit me to make one more observation. Your notes, though in credit\nwith the merchants by way of remittance, do not enter far into ordinary\ncirculation, and this principally on account of their size; which even\nmakes them inconvenient for paying taxes. The taxes of very few amount\nto twenty dollars a single tax; and though the farmers might combine to\nsell their produce for the notes, to pay the taxes jointly; yet this is\nnot always convenient, and will seldom be practised. If the notes were,\nin considerable part, of five, eight, or ten dollars, their circulation\nwould be far more general; the merchants would, even in their retail\noperations, give specie in exchange for balances; which few of them\ncare to do, or can do, with the larger notes; though they are willing\nto take them for their goods.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                                     September 28, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been honored this week with your letters of the twenty-eighth\nof August, and the sixth, twelfth, and seventeenth instant, with their\ninclosures.\n\nIt gives me the most real pleasure to find that my past communications\nhave met with your approbation; and I feel a particular satisfaction\nin the friendly confidence which your letters manifest. I am persuaded\nthat substantial reasons have determined your choice in a particular\ninstance to Doctor Tillotson; and I am flattered by the attention you\nhave obligingly paid to my recommendations of Colonel Malcolm and Mr.\nLawrence. Those gentlemen are now here. They make you the warmest\nacknowledgments for your offer, but decline leaving the State; which,\nindeed, is not compatible with the present prospects of either of them.\n\nI am glad to have had an opportunity of perusing your letter to this\nState, at which so much exception has been taken; because it has\nconfirmed me in what I presumed, that there has been much unjustifiable\nill-humor upon the occasion. I will make use of the knowledge I have to\ncombat misrepresentation.\n\nYours of the twenty-ninth of July to Congress, is full of principles\nand arguments as luminous as they are conclusive. It is to be lamented\nthat they have not had more weight than we are to infer from the\nmomentary expedient adopted by the resolutions of the fourth and tenth;\nwhich will, alone, not be satisfactory to the public creditors; and\nI fear will only tend to embarrass your present operations, without\nanswering the end in view. The more I see, the more I find reason for\nthose who love this country to weep over its blindness.\n\nThe committee on the subject of taxation are met. Some have their\nplans; and they must protect their own children, however misshapen:\nothers have none; but are determined to find fault with all. I expect\nlittle, but I shall promote any thing, though imperfect, that will mend\nour situation.\n\n                                        With sentiments of\n                                        The greatest respect and esteem,\n                                        I have the honor to be, Sir,\n                                        Your most obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\nP.S. The public creditors in this quarter, have had a meeting, and\nappointed a committee to devise measures. The committee will report\npetitions to Congress and the Legislature; and an address to the\npublic creditors in other parts of the State, to appoint persons to\nmeet in convention, to unite in some common measure. I believe they\nwill also propose a general convention of all the creditors in the\ndifferent States.\n\n                                                                   A. H.\n\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\n\n\n                                          Albany, Oct. 5, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nIn my last I informed you, that the committee, appointed by the\nLegislature on the subject of taxation, were together. In spite of my\nefforts, they have parted without doing any thing decisive. They have,\nindeed, agreed upon several matters, and those of importance; but they\nhave not reduced them to the form of a report; which, in fact, leaves\nevery thing afloat, to be governed by the impressions of the moment,\nwhen the Legislature meets.\n\nThe points agreed upon, are these: That there shall be an actual\nvaluation of land, and a tax of so much in the pound.\n\nThe great diversity in the qualities of land would not suffer them\nto listen to an estimated valuation, or to a tax by the quantity,\nagreeably to the idea in your late report to Congress. That there shall\nbe also a tariff of all personal property, to be also taxed at so much\nin the pound; that there shall be a specific tax on carriages, clocks,\nwatches, and other similar articles of luxury; that money, at usury,\nshall be taxed at a fixed rate in the pound, excluding that which is\nloaned to the public; that houses, in all towns, shall be taxed at a\ncertain proportion of the annual rent; that there shall be a poll tax\non all single men from fifteen upwards; and that the collection of the\ntaxes should be advertised to the lowest bidder, at a fixed rate per\ncent., bearing all subordinate expenses.\n\nAmong other things which were rejected, I pressed hard for an excise on\ndistilled liquors; but all that could be carried on this article was a\nlicense on taverns.\n\nThe committee were pretty generally of opinion, that the system of\nfunding for payment of old debts, and for procuring further credit, was\nwise and indispensable; but a majority thought it would be unwise in\none State to contribute in this way alone.\n\nNothing was decided on the quantum of taxes which the State was able to\npay: those who went furthest, did not exceed seventy thousand pounds,\nof which fifty for the use of the United States.\n\nI send you my cash account, which is for what has been received in this\ncounty. We have not heard from the others.\n\n                                            I have the honor to be, Sir,\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\n                                            A. Hamilton.\n\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                            Office of Finance, October 5, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI have now before me your letters of the fourteenth and twenty-first\nof last month. I am sorry to find that you are less sanguine in your\npecuniary expectations than the Governor appears to be; for I have\nalways found that the worst forebodings on this subject are the truest.\nYou will find, at the bottom of this letter, a list of all those which\nI have hitherto received from you. I think they have all been already\nacknowledged; but lest they should not, you will see in one moment, by\nthe list, whether any have miscarried.\n\nI am not surprised to find that the contractors apply with their\npaper, in the first instance, to the Receivers and Collectors. This I\nexpected, because much of that paper is not fit for other purposes.\nSome of it, however, which is payable to the bearer, is calculated for\ncirculation; which you observe is not so general as otherwise it might\nhave been, by reason of the largeness of the sums expressed in the\nnotes. Mr. Duerâs letters contain the same sentiment.\n\nIn issuing this paper, one principal view was to facilitate the payment\nof taxes by obviating the too general (though unjust) complaint of the\nwant of a circulating medium. In substituting paper to specie, the\nfirst obstacle to be encountered, was the total diffidence which had\narisen from the late profusion of it. Had a considerable quantity been\nthrown into the hands of that class of the people, whose ideas on the\nsubject of money, are more the offspring of habit than of reason, it\nmust have depreciated. That this apprehension was just, is clear from\nthis fact, that the paper I first issued, and the Bank paper which\ncame out after it, did depreciate from ten to fifteen per cent. in the\nEastern States, notwithstanding all the precautions which were used.\nIf I had not taken immediate measures to create a demand for it on the\nspot, and to stop issues to that quarter, its credit would have been\ntotally lost for a time, and not easily restored. Besides that, the\nquantities which were pouring in from thence would have done mischief\nhere. Confidence is a plant of very slow growth; and our political\nsituation is not too favorable to it. I am, therefore, very unwilling\nto hazard the germ of a credit, which will, in its greater maturity,\nbecome very useful. If my notes circulate only among mercantile people,\nI do not regret it, but rather wish that the circulation may, for the\npresent, be confined to them, and to the wealthier members of other\nprofessions. It is nothing but the greater convenience, which will\ninduce people to prefer any kind of paper to the precious metals;\nand this convenience is principally felt in large sums. Whenever the\nshopkeepers, in general, discover that my paper will answer as a\nremittance to the principal ports, and will be readily exchanged by\nthe Receivers, they will as readily exchange it for other people. When\nthe people, in general, find that the shopkeepers receive it freely,\nthey will begin to look after it, and not before. For you must know,\nthat whatever fine plausible speeches may be made on this subject,\nthe farmers will not give full credit to money, merely because it will\npay taxes: for that is an object they are not very violently devoted\nto. But that money which goes freely at the store and the tavern,\nwill be sought after as greedily as those things which the store and\nthe tavern contain. Still, however, your objection remains good; that\nthe traffickings in which the greater part of the community engage,\ndo not require sums so large as twenty dollars. This I shall readily\nacknowledge: but you will observe there is infinitely less danger that\nlarge notes, which go only through the hands of intelligent people,\nwill be counterfeited than small ones, which come to the possession of\nilliterate men. When public credit is firmly established, the little\nshocks it receives from the counterfeiters of paper money, do not\nlead to material consequences; but, in the present ticklish state of\nthings, there is just ground of apprehension. Besides this, the value\nof paper will depend much upon the interchanges of it for specie: and\nthese will not take place when there is a circulation of small paper.\nLastly, I have to observe, that until more reliance can be placed on\nthe revenues required, I dare not issue any very considerable amount\nof this paper, lest I should be run upon for more than I could answer:\nand as the circulation of what I dare issue, by increasing the general\nmass, enables people (so far as it goes) more easily to get hold of\nother money, it consequently produces, in its degree, that object of\nfacilitating taxation which I had in view.\n\n                                     I am, Sir,\n                                     Your most obedient, humble servant,\n                                     Robert Morris.\n\n  Alexander Hamilton, Esq.,\n  Receiver for New-York.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DE NOAILLES.\n\n\n                                                                   1782.\n\nEsteem for your talents and acquirements is a sentiment which, from\nmy earliest acquaintance with you, my dear Viscount, I have shared\nin common with all those who have the happiness of knowing you; but\na better knowledge of your character has given it, in my eyes, a\nmore intrinsic merit, and has attached me to you by a friendship\nfounded upon qualities as rare as they are estimable. Averse as I\nam to professions, I cannot forbear indulging this declaration, to\nexpress to you the pleasure I felt at receiving (after an inexplicable\ndelay) the letter you were so obliging as to write me before your\ndeparture from Boston. It was of that kind which is always produced\nby those attentions of friends we value; which, not being invited by\ncircumstances, nor necessitated by the forms of society, bespeak the\nwarmth of the heart. At least my partiality for you makes me fond of\nviewing it in this light, and I cherish the opinion.\n\nI was chagrined to find that you left us with an intention not to\nreturn. Though I should be happy if, by a removal of the war, this\ncountry should cease to be a proper theatre for your exertions, yet,\nif it continues to be so, I hope you will find sufficient motives to\nengage you to change your resolution. Wherever you are, you will be\nuseful and distinguished; but the ardent desire I have of meeting you\nagain, makes me wish America may be your destination. I would willingly\ndo it in France, as you invite me to do; but the prospect of this\nis remote. I must make a more solid establishment here before I can\nconveniently go abroad. There is no country I have a greater curiosity\nto see, or which I am persuaded would be so interesting to me as yours.\nI should be happy to renew and improve the valuable acquaintances from\nthence, which this war has given me an opportunity of making; and,\nthough I could not flatter myself with deriving any advantage from it,\nI am persuaded it is there I should meet with the greatest number of\nthose you describe, who, etc.: but considerations of primary importance\nwill oblige me to submit to the mortification of deferring my visit.\n\nIn the mean time I should be too much the gainer by communication with\nyou, not gladly to embrace the offer you so politely make for writing\nto each other.\n\nThe period, since you left us, has been too barren of events to\nenable me to impart any thing worth attention. The enemy continue in\npossession of Charleston and Savannah, and leave us masters of the\nrest of the country. General Greene has detached Wayne to Georgia;\nbut I believe his views do not extend beyond the mere possession of\nthe country. It is said the Assemblies of the two invaded States are\nabout meeting, to restore the administration of government. This\nwill be a step to strengthening the hands of General Greene, and\ncounteracting the future intrigues of the enemy. Many are sanguine in\nbelieving that all the southern posts will be evacuated, and that a\nfleet of transports is actually gone to bring the garrisons away. For\nmy part, I have doubts upon the subject. My politics are, that while\nthe present ministry can maintain their seats, and procure supplies,\nthey will prosecute the war on the mere chance of events; and that\nwhile this is the plan, they will not evacuate posts so essential as\npoints of departure; from whence, on any favorable turn of affairs,\nto renew their attack on our most vulnerable side. Nor will they\nrelinquish objects that would be so useful to them, should the worst\nhappen in a final negotiation. Clinton, it is said, is cutting a canal\nacross New-York island, through the low grounds, about a mile and a\nhalf from the city. This will be an additional obstacle; but if we\nhave, otherwise, the necessary means to operate, it will not be an\ninsurmountable one. I do not hear that he is constructing any other new\nworks of consequence. To you, who are so thoroughly acquainted with\nthe military posture of things in this country, I need not say that\nthe activity of the next campaign must absolutely depend on effectual\nsuccors from France. I am convinced we shall have a powerful advocate\nin you. La Fayette, we know, will bring âthe whole houseâ with him if\nhe can.\n\nThere has been no material change in our internal situation since you\nleft us. The capital successes we have had, have served rather to\nincrease the hopes than the exertions of the particular States. But\nin one respect we are in a mending way. Our financier has hitherto\nconducted himself with great ability, has acquired an entire personal\nconfidence; revived, in some measure, the public credit; and is\nconciliating fast the support of the moneyed men. His operations have\nhitherto hinged chiefly on the seasonable aids from your country; but\nhe is urging the establishment of permanent funds among ourselves: and\nthough, from the nature and temper of our governments, his applications\nwill meet with a dilatory compliance, it is to be hoped they will by\ndegrees succeed.\n\nThe institution of a Bank has been very serviceable to him: the\ncommercial interest, finding great advantages in it, and anticipating\nmuch greater, is disposed to promote the plan; and nothing but moderate\nfunds, permanently pledged for the security of lenders, is wanting to\nmake it an engine of the most extensive and solid utility. By the last\nadvices there is reason to believe the delinquent States will shortly\ncomply with the requisition of Congress for a duty on our imports.\nThis will be a great resource to Mr. Morris; but it will not alone be\nsufficient.\n\nUpon the whole, however, if the war continues another year, it will\nbe necessary that Congress should again recur to the generosity of\nFrance for pecuniary assistance. The plans of the financier cannot be\nso matured as to enable us, by any possibility, to dispense with this;\nand if he should fail for want of support, we must replunge into that\nconfusion and distress which had like to have proved fatal to us, and\nout of which we are slowly emerging. The cure, on a relapse, would be\ninfinitely more difficult than ever.\n\nI have given you an uninteresting but a faithful sketch of our\nsituation. You may expect, from time to time, to receive from me the\nprogress of our affairs; and I know you will over-pay me.\n\n                                                 I am, my dear Viscount,\n                                                 Yours faithfully,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo the Viscount De Noailles.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GREENE.\n\n\n                                      Albany, October 12, 1782.\n\nDear General:\n\nIt is an age since I have either written to you or received a line\nfrom you; yet I persuade myself you have not been the less convinced\nof my affectionate attachment, and warm participation in all those\nevents which have given you that place in your countryâs esteem and\napprobation which I have known you to deserve, while your enemies and\nrivals were most active in sullying your reputation.\n\nYou will perhaps learn, before this reaches you, that I have been\nappointed a Member of Congress. I expect to go to Philadelphia in the\nensuing month, where I shall be happy to correspond with you with\nour ancient confidence; and I shall entreat you not to confine your\nobservations to military subjects, but to take in the whole scope of\nnational concerns. I am sure your ideas will be useful to me and to the\npublic.\n\nI feel the deepest affliction at the news we have just received of the\nloss of our dear and estimable friend Laurens. His career of virtue\nis at an end. How strangely are human affairs conducted, that so many\nexcellent qualities could not insure a more happy fate! The world will\nfeel the loss of a man who has left few like him behind, and America\nof a citizen whose heart realized that patriotism of which others only\ntalk. I shall feel the loss of a friend I truly and most tenderly\nloved, and one of a very small number.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                          I am, dear Sir,\n                                          Truly your friend and servant,\n                                          A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo General Greene.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\n\n\n                                      Albany, October 26, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nI am honored with your letters of the 5th, 15th, and 16th instant.\n\nThe detail you have been pleased to enter into in that of the 15th,\nexhibits very cogent reasons for confining yourself, to pretty large\ndenominations of notes; some of them had occurred to me, others had\nnot; but I thought it my duty to state to you the operation which\nthat circumstance had; as in the midst of the variety and extent of\nthe objects which occupy your attention, you may not have so good\nopportunities of seeing the effect of your plans in detail. While I\nacknowledge that your observations have corrected my ideas upon the\nsubject, and shown me that there would be danger in generally lessening\nthe denominations of the paper issued, I should be uncandid not to\nadd, that it still appears to me, there would be a preponderance of\nadvantages in having a part of a smaller amount. I shall not trouble\nyou at present with any further reasons for this opinion.\n\nI have immediately on the receipt of your letter taken measures for the\npublication of your advertisement in the newspapers of this State.\n\nYou will perceive by the inclosed cash account that I have received\nfive and twenty hundred dollars; this was procured in part of the loan\nI mentioned to you. It was chiefly paid to me in specie, and I have\nexchanged it with Colonel Pickering and Mr. Duer for your notes; the\nlatter had twelve hundred dollars. Taxes collect slowly, but I must\nshortly receive two or three hundred pounds more, of which Mr. Duer\nwill have the principal benefit, as it appears by your letter to him,\nthat you hoped he might receive three thousand dollars from me.\n\nAs I may shortly set out for Philadelphia, I wish to surrender to Mr.\nTillotson, as soon as you think proper, the office in which he is to\nsucceed.\n\n                                        I have the honor to be,\n                                        With sincere respect and esteem,\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                        Alex. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO LA FAYETTE.\n\n\n                                      Albany, November 3, 1782.\n\nSince we parted, my dear Marquis, at Yorktown, I have received three\nletters from you; one written on your way to Boston, two from France.\nI acknowledge that I have written to you only once; but the reason\nhas been, that I have been taught daily to expect your return. This I\nshould not have done from my own calculations; for I saw no prospect\nbut of an inactive campaign; and you had much better be intriguing for\nyour hobby-horse at Paris, than loitering away your time here. Yet they\nseem to be convinced, at head quarters, that you were certainly coming\nout; and by your letters it appears to have been your own expectation.\nI imagine you have relinquished it by this time.\n\nI have been employed for the last ten months in rocking the cradle\nand studying the art of _fleecing_ my neighbors. I am now a grave\ncounsellor-at-law, and shall soon be a grave member of Congress. The\nLegislature, at their last session, took it into their heads to name\nme, pretty unanimously, one of their delegates.\n\nI am going to throw away a few months more in public life, and then\nretire a simple citizen and good _paterfamilias_. I set out for\nPhiladelphia in a few days. You see the disposition I am in. You are\ncondemned to run the race of ambition all your life. I am already\ntired of the career, and dare to leave it. But you would not give a pin\nfor my letter unless politics or war made a part of it. You tell me\nthey are employed in building _a peace_: and other accounts say it is\nnearly finished. I hope the work may meet with no interruptions. It is\nnecessary for America; especially if your army is taken from us, as we\nare told will soon be the case. That was an essential _point dâappui_,\nthough money was the _primum mobile_ of our finances, which must now\nlose the little activity lately given them. Our trade is prodigiously\ncramped. These States are in no humor for continuing exertions. If the\nwar lasts, it must be carried on by external succors. I make no apology\nfor the inertness of this country: I detest it: but since it exists, I\nam sorry to see other resources diminish.\n\nYour Ministers ought to know best what they are doing; but if the war\ngoes on, and the removal of the army does not prove an unwise measure,\nI renounce all future pretensions to judgment. I think, however, the\ncircumstances of the enemy oblige them to peace.\n\nWe have been hoping that they would abandon their posts in these\nStates. It no doubt was once in contemplation, but latter appearances\nare rather ambiguous. I begin to suspect that if peace is not made,\nNew-York and Charleston, the former at least, will still be held.\n\nThere is no probability that I shall be one of the Commissioners of\nPeace. It is a thing I do not desire myself, and which I imagine other\npeople will not desire.\n\nOur army is now in excellent order, but small.\n\nThe temper we are in respecting the alliance, you will see from public\nacts. There never was a time of greater unanimity on that point.\n\nI wish I durst enter into a greater detail with you; but our cipher is\nnot fit for it, and I fear to trust it in another shape.\n\nIs there any thing you wish on this side the water? You know the warmth\nand sincerity of my attachment. Command me.\n\nI have not been so happy as to see Mr. De Segur. The title of your\nfriend would have been a title to every thing in my power to manifest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                                   Yours _pour la vie_,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\nP.S. I wrote a long letter to the Viscount De Noailles, whom I also\nlove. Has he received it? Is the worthy Gouvion well? Has he succeeded?\nHow is it with our friend Gimat? How is it with General Du Portail? All\nthose men are men of merit, and interest my best wishes.\n\nPoor Laurens! He has fallen a sacrifice to his ardor in a trifling\nskirmish in South Carolina. You know how truly I loved him, and will\njudge how much I regret him.\n\nI will write you again soon after my arrival at Philadelphia.\n\n                                                                   A. H.\n\nTo the Marquis De La Fayette.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THE GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND.\n\n\n                                   Philadelphia, Dec. 11, 1782.\n\nSir:\n\nCongress are equally affected and alarmed by the information they have\nreceived, that the Legislature of your State, at their last meeting,\nhave refused their concurrence in establishing a duty on imports. They\nconsider this measure as so indispensable to the prosecution of the\nwar, that a sense of duty, and regard to the common safety, compel\nthem to renew their efforts to engage a compliance with it. And in\nthis view, they have determined to send a deputation of three members\nto your State, as expressed in the inclosed resolution. The gentlemen\nthey have appointed will be able to lay before you a full and just\nrepresentation of public affairs, from which, they flatter themselves,\nwill result a conviction of the propriety of their solicitude upon\nthe present occasion. Convinced by past experience of the zeal and\npatriotism of the State of Rhode Island, they cannot doubt that it will\nyield to those urgent considerations which flow from a knowledge of our\ntrue situation.\n\nThey will only briefly observe that the increasing discontents of\nthe army, the loud clamors of the public creditors, and the extreme\ndisproportion between the public supplies and the demands of the public\nservice, are so many invincible arguments for the fund recommended by\nCongress. They feel themselves unable to devise any other that will\nbe more efficacious, less exceptionable, or more generally agreeable;\nand if this is refused, they anticipate calamities of a most menacing\nnature--with this consolation, however, that they have faithfully\ndischarged their trust, and that the mischiefs which follow cannot be\nattributed to them.\n\nA principal object of the proposed fund is to _procure loans abroad_.\nIf no security can be held out to lenders, the success of these must\nnecessarily be very limited. The last accounts on the subject were not\nflattering; and when intelligence shall arrive in Europe, that the\nState of Rhode Island has disagreed to the only fund which has yet\nbeen devised, there is every reason to apprehend it will have a fatal\ninfluence upon their future progress.\n\nDeprived of this resource, our affairs must in all probability hasten\nto a dangerous crisis, and these States be involved in greater\nembarrassments than they have yet experienced, and from which it may be\nmuch more difficult to emerge. Congress will only add a request to your\nExcellency, that if the Legislature should not be sitting, it may be\ncalled together as speedily as possible, to enable the gentlemen whom\nthey have deputed to perform the purpose of their mission.\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNOR CLINTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Poughkeepsie, December 29, 1782.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBefore I was honored by your letter of the eighteenth instant, I had\nreceived a line from Colonel Floyd on the same subject. As my answer to\nhis is forwarded by the present conveyance, I beg leave to refer you\nto it for information. I hope it may prove satisfactory; and I flatter\nmyself no further disappointment can take place. Should I, however,\nbe mistaken, you have only to advise me of it, and I will immediately\nforward the cash.\n\nPhelps, who was delayed on the road by the late heavy fall of snow,\nwaited on me a few days since, and delivered me your official\ndispatches of the ninth instant. Considering the disposition heretofore\ndiscovered by Congress, on the subject of our controversy with the\ngrants, their resolutions which you inclosed me, though short of what\nwe are justly entitled to, exceed my expectations; and I am not without\nhope, if properly improved, may be the mean of leading to a just and\nfavorable issue. The idea of many of the military being interested\nin the independency of Vermont, in consequence of their having taken\ngrants of lands under them, I believe is without foundation. There\nwas a period when the disposition of Congress, founded on political\nexpedience, appeared so favorable to the independence of that district,\nas to have induced some gentlemen of the army to apply to the usurped\ngovernment for grants. But when it was discovered that they were\nintriguing with the common enemy, the more respectable characters\nwithdrew their applications, and relinquished all kind of connection\nwith them; and even those who did not go so far, I imagine conceive\nthemselves perfectly secure under our late acts. If, however, this\nshould not be the case, any difficulty which may be apprehended from it\nmay be easily obviated; as I am persuaded the Legislature are disposed\nto every liberal act that may consist with the honor of the State, and\ntend to facilitate a settlement of the dispute. There was a time,\nnot long since, when Congress had only to have spoken decisively\non the subject, and they would have been obeyed: nor do I believe\nthe time is yet past, if they could be convinced that Congress were\nin earnest. But if force is necessary to carry their decision into\nexecution, the longer it is delayed the more force it will require. The\nmisfortune is, though I believe there are but few States that favor\ntheir independence, some members of those who do, take great pains to\nencourage the revolters in their opposition, by secret assurances that\nCongress will not direct any coercive measures against them: and I am\nnot without my fears that this conduct will, in some measure, defeat\nthe present resolutions.\n\n                                   I am, with great respect and esteem,\n                                   Dear Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                   George Clinton.\n\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                            (Most Private.)\n\n                                           Cadix, Feb. 5, 1783.\n\nYour friendship to me, my dear sir, and the affection I have for you,\ncommand my most _confidential_ communications. As public affairs\nhave the first place with me, let me tell you that our Articles of\nConfederation ought to be revised, and measures immediately taken\nto invigorate the Continental Union; depend upon it, there lies the\ndanger for America; this last stroke is wanting, and unless the States\nbe strongly bound to each other, we have much to fear from British,\nand, indeed, from European politics. There ought to be delegates from\neach State, and perhaps some officers among them, one of whom I would\nbe happy to be, who, toward next fall, would meet together, and under\nthe presidence of General Washington, may devise upon amendments to\nbe proposed in the Articles of Confederation--limits of States, &c.,\n&c., &c. As to the army, I hope their country will be grateful, I hope\nthe half pay affair may be terminated to their satisfaction. Now, my\ndear sir, I am going to torment you with my private concerns. First of\nall, I wish the people of America to know that, when I have lengthened\nmy furlough, it was for their service, and at the request of their\ncommissioners; that upon my embarking in a fresh expedition, it was\nwith a view to join you in the summer, with forces adequate to every\nplan General Washington had directed me to promote; that, moreover, a\nCanadian expedition was to take place; that then, instead of sending a\nvessel, I was going myself to America. But that entreaties from your\nresidence at Madrid have forced me to go there, and probably from there\nto Paris; but that in the month of June, I am to embark for America. I\nconfess, my dear sir, I have a great value for my American popularity,\nand I want the people at large to know my affection to them and my\nzeal for their service. The best way to manage it is to have a resolve\nof Congress published, by way of answer to my letters, wherein their\napprobation of my conduct will comprehend the above mentioned matters.\n\nThere is another thing which would highly flatter me, and lies\nwithin your department; a ratification of the treaty will be sent by\nCongress to the Court of England; it is but an honorary commission,\nthat requires only a few weeks, and even a few daysâ attendance. The\nsedentary Minister you may send, or with me, or after me, or, what I\nwould like better, at the time when Great Britain has sent hers to\nyou. So many greater proofs of confidence have been bestowed upon\nme by Congress, that I may truly tell you my wishes upon this very\npleasing mark of their esteem. Upon my leaving England, I have been\nconsidered there as an enthusiastic rebel, and, indeed, a young madman.\nI would well enough like to present myself there in the capacity of\nan Extraordinary Envoy from the United States; and though upon my\ncommitting so far the French Ambassador, I have been with him on pretty\nbad terms; now our friendship has revived, and I am in a situation to\nlead him into my measures, and to know his secrets without telling him\nmine.\n\nAs to the choice of a Minister, (this commission being only a\ncompliment,) I think it is a very difficult task. I advise to take a\ngentleman who had no connection with the great men in England; our\nfriend Hamilton would be a very proper choice; you ought to bring it\nabout. Are you acquainted with Col. Harrison, who was in the Generalâs\nfamily; there are few men so honest and sensible; but I hope you may\nsend Hamilton, and he knows better than all the British councils.\n\nIn case Congress were pleased to do for me what I have so much at\nheart, I would beg you to send Mr. McHenry to me, a member in the\nMaryland Senate. This, my dear sir, is entirely confidential for you,\nand _for you alone_; should the General be in Philadelphia, you may\nshow it to him. Adieu. My best respects wait upon your lady and family.\n\n                                                    Most affectionately,\n                                                    I am yours,\n                                                    La Fayette.\n\nShould you think it of any use to have printed the last paragraph of\nmy letter to Congress, I will be glad of it, as the opinion of one who\nknows Europe may have some weight with the people.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                Philadelphia, February 7, 1788.\n\nSir:\n\nFlattering myself that your knowledge of me will induce you to receive\nthe observations I make, as dictated by a regard to the public good, I\ntake the liberty to suggest to you my ideas on some matters of delicacy\nand importance. I view the present juncture as a very interesting one.\nI need not observe how far the temper and situation of the army make\nit so. The state of our finances was perhaps never more critical. I\nam under injunctions which will not permit me to disclose some facts\nthat would at once demonstrate this position; but I think it probable\nyou will be possessed of them through another channel. It is, however,\ncertain, that there has scarcely been a period of the revolution\nwhich called more for wisdom and decision in Congress. Unfortunately\nfor us, we are a body not governed by reason or foresight, but by\ncircumstances. It is probable we shall not take the proper measures;\nand if we do not, a few months may open an embarrassing scene. This\nwill be the case, whether we have peace or a continuance of the war.\n\nIf the war continues, it would seem that the army must, in June,\nsubsist itself, _to defend the country_. If peace should take place, it\n_will_ subsist itself, _to procure justice to itself_. It appears to be\na prevailing opinion in the army, that the disposition to recompense\ntheir services, will cease with the necessity for them; and that if\nthey once lay down their arms, they part with the means of obtaining\njustice. It is to be lamented that appearances afford too much ground\nfor their distrust.\n\nIt becomes a serious inquiry, What is the true line of policy? The\nclaims of the army, urged with moderation, but with firmness, may\noperate on those weak minds which are influenced by their apprehensions\nmore than by their judgments, so as to produce a concurrence in the\nmeasures which the exigencies of affairs demand. They may add weight\nto the applications of Congress to the several States. So far a useful\nturn may be given to them. But the difficulty will be, to keep a\n_complaining_ and _suffering army_ within the bounds of moderation.\n\nThis your Excellencyâs influence must effect. In order to it, it will\nbe advisable not to discountenance their endeavors to procure redress,\nbut rather, by the intervention of confidential and prudent persons,\n_to take the direction of them_. This, however, must not appear. It\nis of moment to the public tranquillity, that your Excellency should\npreserve the confidence of the army without losing that of the people.\nThis will enable you, in case of extremity, to guide the torrent, and\nto bring order, perhaps even good, out of confusion. âTis a part that\nrequires address; but âtis one which your own situation, as well as the\nwelfare of the community, points out.\n\nI will not conceal from your Excellency a truth which it is necessary\nyou should know. An idea is propagated in the army, that delicacy,\ncarried to an extreme, prevents your espousing its interests with\nsufficient warmth. The falsehood of this opinion no one can be better\nacquainted with than myself; but it is not the less mischievous for\nbeing false. Its tendency is to impair that influence which you may\nexert with advantage, should any commotions unhappily ensue, to\nmoderate the pretensions of the army, and make their conduct correspond\nwith their duty.\n\nThe great _desideratum_ at present, is the establishment of general\nfunds, which alone can do justice to the creditors of the United States\n(of whom the army forms the most meritorious class), restore public\ncredit, and supply the future wants of government. This is the object\nof all men of sense. In this, the influence of the army, properly\ndirected, may co-operate.\n\nThe intimations I have thrown out, will suffice to give your Excellency\na proper conception of my sentiments. You will judge of their\nreasonableness or fallacy; but I persuade myself you will do justice to\nmy motives.\n\n                                                I have the honor to be,\n                                                With great respect,\n                                                Your Excellencyâs\n                                                Most obedient servant,\n                                                Alex. Hamilton.\n\nGeneral Knox has the confidence of the army, and is a man of sense. I\nthink he may be safely made use of. Situated as I am, your Excellency\nwill feel the confidential nature of these observations.\n\nHis Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                 Newburgh, 17th February, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am now on a visit from the General from Kingston, where the\nLegislature is convened. The British Kingâs speech----to his\nParliament, and his Secretaryâs letters to the Lord Mayor of London,\nwhich we had the pleasure of meeting here, afford us the fairest\nprospect of a speedy peace. I have but one anxiety remaining, and\nthat respects a better establishment of our General Government on\na basis that will secure the permanent union of the States, and a\npunctual payment of the public debts. I do not think our Legislature\nwill be averse to a reasonable system. The Assembly have agreed to the\nrequisitions of Congress, and to press for the arrears of taxes; and\na joint committee of both Houses have taken measures to compel the\nimmediate production of the accounts of all who have been intrusted\nwith public money. This last step became so necessary, that I found\nno difficulty in getting it adopted. I would even hazard an attempt\nto introduce an intendant, if I had proper materials; but I am\ndisappointed in not receiving the Maryland plan, which was promised\nme by Mr. Wright and Mr. Homsly. If possible, I still wish you would\nforward this act on this subject, and for the collection of taxes. The\nexample of a State may be adopted, when any plan of my own might be\nrejected. There is such confusion in the present administration of our\nState finances, and the weight of our debts is so burthensome, that a\nremedy must be provided; and I apprehend the production of the public\naccounts, before alluded to, will furnish us with sufficient arguments\nto prove its necessity.\n\nWe are in want of the report, and of the evidence and arguments in\nsupport of our Territorial rights. If, as you proposed, you have taken\nthe trouble to copy it, be so obliging as to transmit your copy. Should\nyour leisure not have been sufficient for the undertaking, be pleased\nto get it transcribed and forwarded. It is a collection of great\nimportance to the State, and if it should be lost, I do not know who\nwould submit to the labor of a second effort.\n\nGeneral Schuyler was sent for a week ago to pay the last duties to\nyour grandfather. He wrote me the tenth, that there was no hopes\nof his surviving many days, but I learn that he was still living\nfour days ago, without the least prospect of recovery. From your\nknown punctuality, I take it for granted that you have written to me\nagreeably to your promise, and that your letters have miscarried. Any\ncommunication, while the Legislature are convened, would be peculiarly\nacceptable, and probably useful.\n\nBe pleased to present my respectful compliments to Colonel Floyd, to\nMrs. Hamilton, and Mr. and Mrs. Carter, and to the gentlemen of our\nfamily, etc.\n\n                             With the utmost regard, I remain, dear Sir,\n                             Your affectionate and most\n                             Obedient humble servant,\n                             Jas. Duane.\n\nColonel Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\n\n\n                                                      February, 24, 1783\n\nSir:\n\nIn my letter of the fourteenth I informed your Excellency, that\nCongress were employed in devising a plan for carrying the eighth\narticle of the Confederation into execution. This business is at\nlength brought to a conclusion. I inclose, for the information of the\nLegislature, the proceedings upon it in different stages, by which\nthey will see the part I have acted. But as I was ultimately left in a\nsmall minority, I think it my duty to explain the motives upon which my\nopposition to the general course of the House was founded.\n\nI am of opinion, that the article of the Confederation itself was\nill-judged. In the first place, I do not believe there is any general\nrepresentative of the wealth of a nation, the criterion of its ability\nto pay taxes. There are only two that can be thought of, _land_ and\n_numbers_.\n\nThe revenues of the United Provinces (general and particular) were\ncomputed, before the present war, to more than half as much as those\nof Great Britain. The extent of their territory is not one-fourth part\nas great; their population less than a third. The comparison is still\nmore striking between those Provinces and the Swiss Cantons; in both\nof which, extent of territory and population are nearly the same; and\nyet the revenues of the former are five times as large as those of the\nlatter; nor could any efforts of taxation bring them to any thing like\na level. In both cases, the advantages for agriculture are superior\nin those countries which afford least revenue in proportion. I have\nselected these examples because they are most familiar; but whoever\nwill extend the comparison between the nations of the world, will\nperceive that the position I have laid down is supported by universal\nexperience.\n\nThe truth is, the ability of a country to pay taxes depends on\ninfinite combinations of physical and moral causes, which can never\nbe accommodated to any general rule; climate, soil, productions,\nadvantages for navigation, government, genius of the people, progress\nof arts and industry, and an endless variety of circumstances. The\ndiversities are sufficiently great, in these States, to make an\ninfinite difference in their relative wealth; the proportion of which\ncan never be found by any common measure whatever.\n\nThe only possible way, then, of making them contribute to the general\nexpense, in an equal proportion to their means, is by general taxes\nimposed under Continental authority.\n\nIn this mode, there would, no doubt, be inequalities, and, for a\nconsiderable time, material ones; but experience, and the constant\noperation of a general interest, which, by the very collision of\nparticular interests, must, in the main, prevail in a Continental\ndeliberative, would at length correct those inequalities, and balance\none tax that should bear hard upon one State, by another that should\nhave proportional weight in others. This idea, however, was not, at the\nperiod of framing the Confederation, and is not yet, agreeable to the\nspirit of the time. To futurity we must leave the discovery, how far\nthis spirit is wise or foolish. One thing only is now certain; that\nCongress, having the discretionary power of determining the quantum\nof money to be paid into the general treasury towards defraying the\ncommon expenses, have, in effect, the constitutional power of general\ntaxation.\n\nThe restraints upon the exercise of this power, amount to perpetuating\na rule for fixing the proportions, which must of necessity produce\ninequality, and, by refusing the Federal Government a power of specific\ntaxation and of collection, without substituting any other adequate\nmeans of coercion, do, in fact, leave the compliance with Continental\nrequisitions to the good will of the respective States. Inequality is\ninherent in the theory of the Confederation; and, in the practice, that\ninequality must increase in proportion to the honesty or dishonesty of\nthe component parts. This vice will either, in its consequences, reform\nthe Federal Constitution, or dissolve it.\n\nIf a general standard must be fixed, numbers were preferable to\nland. Modes might be devised to ascertain the former with tolerable\nprecision; but I am persuaded the experiment will prove, that the value\nof all the land in each State cannot be ascertained with any thing like\nexactness. Both these measures have the common disadvantage of being no\nequal representative of the wealth of the people; but one is much more\nsimple, definite, and certain than the other.\n\nI have indulged myself in these remarks, to show that I have little\nexpectation of success from any mode of carrying the article in\nquestion into execution upon equitable principles. I owe it, however,\nto myself, to declare, that my opposition did not arise from this\nsource. The Confederation has pointed out this mode; and, though I\nwould heartily join in a representation of the difficulties (of which\nevery man of sense must be sensible on examination) that occur in the\nexecution of the plan, to induce the States to consent to a change,\nyet, as this was not the disposition of a majority of Congress, I\nwould have assented to any mode of attempting it which was not either\nobviously mischievous or impracticable.\n\nThe first plan proposed, as your Excellency will see, was an actual\nvaluation of each State by itself. This was evidently making the\ninterested party judge in his own cause. Those who have seen the\noperation of this principle between the counties in the same State,\nand the districts in the same county, cannot doubt a moment that the\nvaluations on this plan would have been altogether unequal and unjust.\nWithout supposing more liberality in one State than another, the degree\nof care, judgment, and method, employed in the execution, would alone\nmake extreme differences in the results.\n\nThis mode has, also, the further inconvenience of awakening all the\njealousies of the several States against each other. Each would suspect\nthat its neighbor had favored itself, whether the partiality appeared\nor not. It would be impossible to silence these distrusts, and to make\nthe States sit down satisfied with the justice of each other. Every new\nrequisition for money would be a new signal for discussion and clamor;\nand the seeds of disunion, already sown too thick, would not be a\nlittle multiplied.\n\nTo guard against these evils, the plan proposes a revision by Congress;\nbut it is easy to be seen that such a power could not be exercised.\nShould any States return defective valuations, it would be difficult\nto find sufficient evidence to determine them such. To alter would\nnot be admissible; for Congress could have no data which could be\npresumed equivalent to those which must have governed the judgment of\ncommissioners under oath, or an actual view of the premises. To do\neither this, or to reject, would be an impeachment of the honor of the\nStates, which it is not probable there would be decision enough to\nhazard; and which, if done, could not fail to excite serious disgusts.\nThere is a wide difference between a single State exercising such a\npower over its own counties, and a Confederated Government exercising\nit over sovereign States which compose the Confederacy. It might also\nhappen, that too many States would be interested in the defective\nvaluations, to leave a sufficient number willing, either to alter or to\nreject.\n\nThese considerations prevailed to prevent the plan being adopted by a\nmajority.\n\nThe last plan may be less mischievous than the first; but it appears\nto me altogether ineffectual. The mere quantity of land granted and\nsurveyed, with the general species of buildings upon them, can\ncertainly be no criteria to determine their value. The plan does not\neven distinguish the improved from the unimproved land; the qualities\nof soil, or degrees of improvement: the quantities of the houses and\nother buildings, are entirely omitted. These, it seems, are to be\njudged of by the commissioners to be appointed by each State. But I am\nunable to conceive, how any commissioner can form the least estimate\nof these circumstances with respect even to his own State, much less\nwith respect to other States, which would be necessary to establish\na just relative value. If even there was a distinction of improved\nfrom unimproved land, by supposing an intrinsic value in the land, and\nadopting general rates, something nearer the truth might be attained;\nbut it must now be all conjecture and uncertainty.\n\nThe numbers of inhabitants, distinguishing white from black, are called\nfor. This is not only totally foreign to the Confederation, but can\nanswer no reasonable purpose. It has been said, that the proportion\nof numbers may guide and correct the estimates. An assertion, purely\nverbal, has no meaning. A judgment must first be formed of the value\nof the lands upon some principles. If this should be altered by the\nproportion of numbers, it is plain numbers would be substituted to land.\n\nAnother objection to this plan is, that it lets in the particular\ninterests of the States, to operate in the returns of the quantities of\nland, number of buildings, and number of inhabitants. But the principle\nof this objection applies less forcibly here than against the former\nplan.\n\nWhoever will consider the plain import of the eighth article of the\nConfederation, must be convinced, that it intended an _actual_ and\n_specific_ valuation of land, buildings, and improvements, not a mere\ngeneral estimate, according to the present plan. While we insist,\ntherefore, upon adhering to the Confederation, we should do it in\nreality, not barely in appearance.\n\nMany of those who voted for this scheme, had as bad an opinion of it\nas myself; but they were induced to accede to it, by a persuasion that\nsome plan for the purpose was expected by the States; and that none\nbetter, in the present circumstances of the country, could be fallen\nupon.\n\nA leading rule which I have laid down for the direction of my conduct,\nis this: that while I would have a just deference for the expectations\nof the States, I would never consent to amuse them by attempts which\nmust either fail in the execution, or be productive of evil. I would\nrather incur the negative inconveniences of delay than the positive\nmischiefs of injudicious expedients. A contrary conduct serves to\ndestroy confidence in the government, the greatest misfortune that can\nbefall a nation. There should, in my opinion, be a character of wisdom\nand efficiency in all the measures of the Federal Council, the opposite\nof a spirit of temporizing concession.\n\nI would have sufficient reliance on the judgments of the several\nStates, to hope that good reasons for not attempting a thing, would be\nmore satisfactory to them than precipitate and fruitless attempts.\n\nMy idea is, that, taking it for granted the States will expect an\nexperiment on the principle of the Confederation, the best plan will\nbe to make it by commissioners appointed by Congress, and acting under\ntheir authority. Congress might, in the first instance, appoint three\nor more of the principal characters in each State for probity and\nabilities, with a power to nominate other commissioners under them, in\neach subdivision of the State. General principles might be laid down\nfor the regulation of their conduct, by which uniformity in the manner\nof conducting the business would obtain. Sanctions of such solemnity\nmight be prescribed, and such notoriety given to every part of the\ntransaction, that the commissioners could neither be careless nor\npartial without a sacrifice of reputation.\n\nTo carry this plan, however, into effect, with sufficient care and\naccuracy, would be a work both of time and expense; and, unfortunately,\nwe are so pressed to find money for calls of immediate necessity, that\nwe could not, at present, undertake a measure which would require so\nlarge a sum.\n\nTo me it appears evident, that every part of a business which is of\nso important and universal concern, should be transacted on uniform\nprinciples, and under the direction of that _body_ which has a common\ninterest.\n\nIn general, I regard the present moment, probably the dawn of peace,\nas peculiarly critical; and the measures which it shall produce, as\nof great importance to the future welfare of these States. I am,\ntherefore, scrupulously cautious of assenting to plans which appear to\nme founded on false principles.\n\nYour Excellency will observe, that the valuation of the lands is to be\nthe standard for adjusting the accounts, for past supplies, between the\nUnited States and the particular States. This, if adhered to, without\nallowance for the circumstances of those States which have been more\nimmediately the theatre of the war, will charge our State for the past,\naccording to its _future ability_, when in an entire condition, if the\nvaluation should be made after we regain possession of the parts of the\nState now in the power of the enemy.\n\nI have heretofore introduced a motion for repeating the call, in a\nmore earnest manner, upon the States, to vest Congress with a power of\nmaking equitable abatements, agreeably to the spirit of the Resolution\nof the twentieth of February last, which few of the States have\ncomplied with. This motion has been committed. I know not what will be\nits fate.\n\nNotwithstanding the opposition I have given, now the matter has been\ndecided in Congress, I hope the State will cheerfully comply with what\nis required. Unless each State is governed by this principle, there is\nan end of the Union. Every State will, no doubt, have a right, in this\ncase, to accompany its compliance with such remarks as it may think\nproper.\n\n                                    I have the honor to be,\n                                    Your Excellencyâs most obât servant,\n                                    A. Hamilton.\n\nP. S. After the plan was agreed upon, it was committed to be put into\nform; and, when reported, instead of commissioners, an alteration was\ncarried for making the estimate by a Grand Committee.\n\n                                                            February 27.\n\nMr. Morris has signified to Congress, his resolution to resign by the\nfirst of June, if adequate funds are not by that time provided. This\nwill be a severe stroke to our affairs. No man, fit for the office,\nwill be willing to supply his place, for the very reason he resigns.\n\nâTis happy for us we have reasons to expect a peace. I am sorry that,\nby different accounts, it appears not to have been concluded late in\nDecember.\n\nTo His Excellency Governor Clinton.\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNOR CLINTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   Kingston, February 24, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been honored by your letter of the twelfth of January. You may\nremember, that in July last, I submitted to the consideration of our\nLegislature, certain Resolutions of the Assembly of New Hampshire,\nmaking overtures for an amicable settlement of a boundary line between\nthe two States; which were read and committed: but as the session\nwas short, and devoted principally to the particular business for\nwhich they were convened, no determination was had on the subject. I\nhad some reason to expect a consideration of these Resolutions would\nhave taken place at the present meeting. This induced me to defer\nanswering your letter until I could inform you of the result. I cannot,\nhowever, discover any disposition to take up this business. It seems\nto be the prevailing opinion, that as Congress has engaged to make a\nfinal decision of the controversy respecting the district called the\nGrants, a partial compromise of the matter would be improper; as any\nmeasures for the purpose, might alienate the affections of our most\nzealous subjects in that quarter, and be attended with other dangerous\nconsequences. Besides, doubts exist whether the Legislature have\nauthority, by any act of theirs, to consent to such a dismemberment\nof the State as would probably be insisted upon, on a compromise with\nNew Hampshire. I am, nevertheless, still persuaded, should Congress\ndetermine the summit of the mountains to be the boundary between the\ntwo States, this State (whatever our sentiments might be of the equity\nof the decision) would, for the sake of peace, submit to it: and there\ncannot be a doubt, but that New Hampshire would be perfectly satisfied\nwith the jurisdiction of so extensive and valuable a territory. I take\nit for granted, that, whatever may be the decision, equitable measures\nwill be adopted for securing the property of individuals.\n\nI congratulate you, most sincerely, on the promising prospects of\npeace. I pray nothing may prevent the desirable event soon taking\nplace. Our friends from the city, and Long Island, anxiously wait for\nthe moment in which they may return to their homes. The expectations\nof all are so much raised as to obstruct public business not a little.\nPlease to offer my best respects to Mrs. Hamilton, and believe me,\n\n                                        With great respect and esteem,\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                        Geo. Clinton.\n\nP. S. It is with great concern I mention, that since writing the\nabove, I am informed of the death of your relation, Colonel John Van\nRensselaer. He departed this life on Friday last. General Schuyler, who\nwas sent for when his recovery was despaired of, is to set out from\nAlbany on his return to this place on Wednesday next.\n\n                                                                   G. C.\n\nTo Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Newburgh, March 4, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your favor of February, and thank you for the\ninformation and observations it has conveyed to me. I shall always\nthink myself obliged by a free communication of sentiments, and have\noften thought (but suppose I thought wrong, as it did not accord with\nthe practice of Congress), that the public interest might be benefited,\nif the Commander-in-Chief of the army was let more into the political\nand pecuniary state of our affairs than he is. Enterprises, and the\nadoption of military and other arrangements that might be exceedingly\nproper in some circumstances, would be altogether improper in others.\nIt follows, then, by fair deduction, that where there is a want of\ninformation, there must be chance-medley; and a man may be upon the\nbrink of a precipice before he is aware of his danger, when a little\nforeknowledge might enable him to avoid it. But this by the by.\n\nThe hint contained in your letter, and the knowledge I have derived\nfrom the public gazettes, respecting the non-payment of taxes, contain\nall the information I have received of the danger that stares us in the\nface on account of our funds; and so far was I from conceiving that\nour finances were in so deplorable a state, _at this time_, that I had\nimbibed ideas from some source or other, that, with the prospect of a\nloan from Holland, we should be able to rub along.\n\nTo you, who have seen the danger to which the army has been exposed\nto a political dissolution for want of subsistence, and the unhappy\nspirit of licentiousness which it imbibed by becoming, in one or two\ninstances, its own proveditors, no observations are necessary to\nevince the fatal tendency of such a measure; but I shall give it as my\nopinion, that it would at this day be productive of civil commotions\nand end in blood. Unhappy situation this! God forbid we should be\ninvolved in it.\n\nThe predicament in which I stand, as citizen and soldier, is as\ncritical and delicate as can well be conceived. It has been the subject\nof many contemplative hours. The sufferings of a complaining army on\none hand, and the inability of Congress, and tardiness of the States on\nthe other, are the forebodings of evil, and may be productive of events\nwhich are more to be deprecated than prevented: but I am not without\nhope, if there is such a disposition shown as prudence and policy\ndictate, to do justice, your apprehensions, in case of peace, are\ngreater than there is cause for. In this, however, I may be mistaken,\nif those ideas which you have been informed are propagated in the army,\nshould be extensive, the source of which may be easily traced; as the\nold leaven, _it is said_, for I have no proof of it, is again beginning\nto work, under the mask of the most perfect dissimulation and apparent\ncordiality.\n\nBe these things as they may, I shall pursue the same steady line\nof conduct which has governed me hitherto; fully convinced, that\nthe sensible and discerning part of the army cannot be unacquainted\n(although I never took pains to inform them) of the services I have\nrendered it on more occasions than one. This, and pursuing the\nsuggestions of your letter, which I am happy to find coincide with\nmy own practice for several months past, and which was the means of\ndirecting the business of the army into the channel it now is, leave me\nunder no _great_ apprehension of its exceeding the bounds of reason and\nmoderation; notwithstanding the prevailing sentiment in the army is,\nthat the prospect of compensation for past services will terminate with\nthe war.\n\nThe just claims of the army ought, and it is to be hoped will, have\ntheir weight with every sensible Legislature in the Union, if Congress\npoint to their demands; show (if the case is so) the reasonableness of\nthem; and the impracticability of complying without their aid. In any\nother point of view, it would, in my opinion, be impolitic to introduce\nthe army on the tapis, lest it should excite jealousy and bring on\nits concomitants. The States cannot, surely, be so devoid of common\nsense, common honesty, and common policy, as to refuse their aid, on\na full, clear, and candid representation of facts from Congress; more\nespecially, if these should be enforced by members of their own body,\nwho might demonstrate what the inevitable consequences of failure must\nlead to.\n\nIn my opinion it is a matter worthy of consideration, how far an\nadjournment of Congress for a few months is advisable. The delegates,\nin that case, if they are in unison themselves respecting the great\ndefects of their Constitution, may represent them fully and boldly to\ntheir constituents. To me, who know nothing of the business which is\nbefore Congress, nor of the arcanum, it appears that such a measure\nwould tend to promote the public weal: for it is clearly my opinion,\nunless Congress have powers competent to all _general_ purposes, that\nthe distresses we have encountered, the expenses we have incurred, and\nthe blood we have spilt, in the course of an eight yearsâ war, will\navail us nothing.\n\nThe contents of your letter is known only to myself; and your prudence\nwill direct what should be done with this.\n\n                                           With great esteem and regard,\n                                           I am, dear Sir,\n                                           Your most obedient servant,\n                                           G. Washington.\n\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                   Philadelphia, March 5, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nI had the honor of writing to your Excellency lately on a very\nconfidential subject, and shall be anxious to know, as soon as\nconvenient, whether the letter got safe to hand.\n\nThe bearer, Shattuck, thinks he can point out means of apprehending\nWells and Knowlton, the two persons whom your Excellency was authorized\nto have taken into custody. I have desired him to call upon you to\ndisclose the plan.\n\nI will not trouble your Excellency with any observation on the\nimportance of getting hold of those persons.\n\nThe surmise that Mr. Arnold, a member of Congress, gave intelligence to\nthem of the design to take them, makes it peculiarly important.\n\n                                     I have the honor to be,\n                                     Your Excellencyâs most obât servât,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Newburgh, March 12, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I wrote to you last, we were in a state of tranquillity; but after\nthe arrival of a certain gentleman, who shall be nameless at present,\nfrom Philadelphia, a storm very suddenly arose, with unfavorable\nprognostics; which, though diverted for a moment, is not yet blown\nover; nor is it in my power to point to the issue.\n\nThe papers which I send officially to Congress, will supersede the\nnecessity of my remarking on the tendency of them. The notification and\naddress, both, appeared at the same instant, on the day preceding the\nintended meeting. The first of these I got hold of the same afternoon;\nthe other not till next morning.\n\nThere is something very mysterious in this business. It appears reports\nhave been propagated in Philadelphia, that dangerous combinations were\nforming in the army; and this at a time when there was not a syllable\nof the kind in agitation in camp. It also appears, that upon the\narrival in camp of the gentleman above alluded to, such sentiments as\nthese were immediately circulated: That it was universally expected the\narmy would not disband until they had obtained justice; that the public\ncreditors looked up to them for redress of their own grievances; would\nafford them every aid, and even join them in the field, if necessary;\nthat some members of Congress wished the measure might take effect, in\norder to compel the public, particularly the delinquent States, to do\njustice; with many other suggestions of a similar nature.\n\nFrom this, and a variety of other considerations, it is firmly believed\nby _some_, the scheme was not only planned, but also digested and\nmatured, in Philadelphia;[19] but my opinion shall be suspended till\nI have better ground to found one on. The matter was managed with\ngreat art; for as soon as the minds of the officers were thought to be\nprepared for the transaction, the anonymous invitations and addresses\nto the officers were put in circulation through every State line in\nthe army. I was obliged, therefore, in order to arrest on the spot,\nthe feet that stood wavering on a tremendous precipice, to prevent the\nofficers from being taken by surprise, while the passions were all\ninflamed, and to rescue them from plunging themselves into a gulf of\ncivil horror from which there might be no receding, to issue the order\nof the eleventh.\n\nThis was done upon the principle that it is easier to divert from a\nwrong, and point to a right path, than it is to recall the hasty and\nfatal steps which have been already taken.\n\nIt is commonly supposed, if the officers had met agreeably to the\nanonymous summons, with their feelings all alive, resolutions might\nhave been formed, the consequences of which may be more easily\nconceived than described. Now they will have leisure to view the matter\nmore calmly, and will act more seriously. It is to be hoped they will\nbe induced to adopt more rational measures, and wait a while longer a\nsettlement of their accounts, the postponing of which appears to be the\nmost plausible, and almost the only article of which designing men can\nmake an improper use, by insinuating (which they really do) that it is\ndone with design that peace may take place, and prevent any adjustment\nof accounts; which, say they, would inevitably be the case, if the\nwar was to cease to-morrow: or, supposing the best, you would have to\ndance attendance at public offices, at great distances, perhaps, and\nequally great expenses, to obtain a settlement, which would be highly\ninjurious, nay, ruinous to you. This is their language.\n\nLet me beseech you, therefore, my good sir, to urge this matter\nearnestly, and without further delay. The situation of these gentlemen,\nI do verily believe, is distressing beyond description. It is affirmed\nto me, that a large part of them have no better prospect before them\nthan a jail, if they are turned loose without liquidation of accounts,\nand an assurance of that justice to which they are so worthily\nentitled. To prevail on the delegates of those States, through whose\nmeans these difficulties occur, it may, in my opinion, with propriety\nbe suggested to them, if any disastrous consequences should follow, by\nreason of their delinquency, that they must be answerable to God and\ntheir Country for the ineffable horrors which may be occasioned thereby.\n\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             G. Washington.\n\nP. S. I have received your letter of the fifth, and have put that\nmatter in train which was mentioned in it.\n\n                                                                   G. W.\n\nI am this instant informed, that a second address to the officers,\ndistinguished No. 2, is thrown into circulation. The contents evidently\nprove, that the author is in, or near, camp; and that the following\nwords, erased in the second page of this letter, ought not to have met\nwith this treatment, viz.--âBy others, that it is the illegitimate\noffspring of a person in the army.â\n\n\n[19] The words, âBy others, that it is the illegitimate offspring of\na person in the army,â which came in here, are obliterated in the\noriginal, but were restored by Washington in the _postscript_.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                  Philadelphia, March 17, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nI am duly honored with your Excellencyâs letters of the fourth and\ntwelfth instant. It is much to be regretted, though not to be wondered\nat, that steps of so inflammatory a tendency have been taken in the\narmy. Your Excellency has, in my opinion, acted wisely. The best way\nis, ever, not to attempt to stem a torrent, but to divert it.\n\nI am happy to find you coincide in opinion with me on the conduct\nproper to be observed by yourself. I am persuaded, more and more, it\nis that which is most consistent with your own reputation and the\npublic safety. Our affairs wear a most serious aspect, as well foreign\nas domestic. Before this gets to hand, your Excellency will probably\nhave seen the provisional articles between Great Britain and these\nStates. It might, at first appearance, be concluded, that these will be\nthe prelude to a general peace; but there are strong reasons to doubt\nthe truth of such a conclusion. Obstacles may arise from different\nquarters; from the demands of Spain and Holland; from the hope, in\nFrance, of greater acquisitions in the East; and, perhaps, still more\nprobably, from the insincerity and duplicity of Lord Shelburne, whose\npolitics, founded in the peculiarity of his situation, as well as in\nthe character of the man, may well be suspected of insidiousness.\nI am really apprehensive, if peace does not take place, that the\nnegotiations will tend to sow distrust among the allies, and weaken the\nforce of the common league. We have, I fear, men among us, and men in\ntrust, who have a hankering after British connection. We have others\nwhose confidence in France savors of credulity. The intrigues of the\nformer, and the incautiousness of the latter, may be both, though in\ndifferent degrees, injurious to the American interests, and make it\ndifficult for prudent men to steer a proper course.\n\nThere are delicate circumstances, with respect to the late foreign\ntransactions, which I am not at liberty to reveal; but which, joined to\nour internal weaknesses, disorders, follies, and prejudices, make this\ncountry stand upon precarious ground.\n\nSome use, perhaps, may be made of these ideas, to induce moderation in\nthe army. An opinion that their country does not stand upon a secure\nfooting, will operate upon the patriotism of the officers against\nhazarding any domestic commotions.\n\nWhen I make these observations, I cannot forbear adding, that if\nno excesses take place, I shall not be sorry that ill-humors have\nappeared. I shall not regret importunity, if temperate, from the army.\n\nThere are good intentions in the majority of Congress, but there is\nnot sufficient wisdom or decision. There are dangerous prejudices, in\nthe particular States, opposed to those measures which alone can give\nstability and prosperity to the Union. There is a fatal opposition to\nContinental views. Necessity alone can work a reform. But how produce\nthat necessity, how apply it, and how keep it within salutary bounds? I\nfear we have been contending for a shadow.\n\nThe affair of accounts I considered as having been put on a\nsatisfactory footing. The particular States have been required to\nsettle till the first of August, â80; and the Superintendent of Finance\nhas been directed to take measures for settling since that period. I\nshall immediately see him on the subject.\n\nWe have had eight States and a half in favor of a commutation of the\nhalf pay for an average of ten yearsâ purchase; that is, five yearsâ\nfull pay instead of half pay for life, which, on a calculation of\nannuities, is nearly an equivalent. I hope this will now shortly take\nplace.\n\nWe have made considerable progress in a plan to be recommended to the\nseveral States for funding all the public debts, including those of\nthe army; which is certainly the only way to restore public credit,\nand enable us to continue the war by borrowing abroad, if it should be\nnecessary, to continue it.\n\nI omitted mentioning to your Excellency, that, from European\nintelligence, there is great reason to believe, at all events, peace or\nwar, New-York will be evacuated in the spring. It will be a pity if any\ndomestic disturbances should change the plans of the British Court.\n\n                                     I have the honor to be,\n                                     With the greatest respect,\n                                     Your Excellencyâs most obât servât,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\nP. S. Your Excellency mentions, that it has been surmised, the plan\nin agitation was formed in Philadelphia; that combinations have been\ntalked of between the public creditors and the army; and that members\nof Congress had encouraged the idea. This is partly true. I have myself\nurged, in Congress, the propriety of uniting the influence of the\npublic creditors, and the army, as a part of them, to prevail upon the\nStates to enter into their views. I have expressed the same sentiments\nout of doors. Several other members of Congress have done the same. The\nmeaning, however, of all this, was simply, that Congress should adopt\nsuch a plan as would embrace the relief of all the public creditors,\nincluding the army; in order that the personal influence of some, the\nconnections of others, and a sense of justice to the army, as well as\nthe apprehension of ill consequences, might form a mass of influence,\nin each State, in favor of the measures of Congress. In this view,\nas I mentioned to your Excellency in a former letter, I thought the\ndiscontents of the army might be turned to a good account. I am still\nof opinion, that their earnest but respectful applications for redress\nwill have a good effect. As to any combination of _force_, it would\nonly be productive of the horrors of a civil war, might end in the ruin\nof the country, and would certainly end in the ruin of the army.\n\n                                                                   A. H.\n\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                  Philadelphia, March 24, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nYour Excellency will, before this reaches you, have received a letter\nfrom the Marquis De La Fayette, informing you, that the preliminaries\nof peace between all the belligerent powers have been concluded. I\ncongratulate your Excellency on this happy conclusion of your labors.\nIt now only remains to make solid establishments within, to perpetuate\nour Union, to prevent our being a ball in the hands of European powers,\nbanded against each other at their pleasure; in fine, to make our\nindependence truly a blessing. This, it is to be lamented, will be an\narduous work; for, to borrow a figure from mechanics, the centrifugal\nis much stronger than the centripetal force in these States; the seeds\nof disunion much more numerous than those of union.\n\nI will add, that your Excellencyâs exertions are as essential to\naccomplish this end, as they have been to establish independence. I\nwill, upon a future occasion, open myself upon this subject.\n\nYour conduct in the affair of the officers is highly pleasing here. The\nmeasures of the army are such as I could have wished them, and will\nadd new lustre to their character, as well as strengthen the hands of\nCongress.\n\n                                     I am, with great truth and respect,\n                                     Your Excellencyâs\n                                     Most obedient servant,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\nTo his Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                  Philadelphia, March 25, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nI wrote to your Excellency a day or two ago by express. Since that,\na committee, appointed on the communications from you, have had a\nmeeting, and find themselves embarrassed. They have requested me to\ncommunicate our embarrassments to you in confidence, and to ask your\nprivate opinion. The army, by their resolutions, express an expectation\nthat Congress will not disband them previous to a settlement of\naccounts, and the establishment of funds. Congress may resolve upon the\nfirst, but the general opinion is, that they cannot constitutionally\ndeclare the second. They have no right, by the Confederation, to\n_demand_ funds; they can only recommend: and to determine, that the\narmy shall be continued in service till the States grant them, would\nbe to determine, that the whole present army shall be a standing\narmy during peace, unless the States comply with the requisition for\nfunds. This, it is supposed, would excite the alarms and jealousies of\nthe States, and increase, rather than lessen, the opposition to the\nfunding scheme. It is also observed, that the longer the army is kept\ntogether, the more the payment of past dues is procrastinated; the\nabilities of the States being exhausted for their immediate support,\nand a new debt every day incurred. It is further suggested, that there\nis danger in keeping the army together, in a state of inactivity, and\nthat a separation of the several lines would facilitate the settlement\nof accounts, diminish present expense, and avoid the danger of union.\nIt is added, that the officers of each line, being on the spot, might,\nby their own solicitations, and those of their friends, forward the\nadoption of funds in the different States.\n\nA proposition will be transmitted to you by Colonel Bland, in the form\nof a resolution, to be adopted by Congress, framed upon the principles\nof the foregoing reasoning.\n\nAnother proposition is contained in the following resolution:\n\nâThat the Commander-in-Chief be informed, it is the intention of\nCongress to effect the settlement of the accounts of the respective\nlines previous to their reduction; and that Congress are doing, and\nwill continue to do, every thing in their power towards procuring\nsatisfactory securities for what shall be found due on such settlement.â\n\nThe scope of this your Excellency will perceive without comment.\n\nI am to request you will favor me with your sentiments on both the\npropositions; and, in general, with your ideas of what had best be done\nwith reference to the expectation expressed by the officers; taking\ninto view the situation of Congress. On one side, the army expect they\nwill not be disbanded till accounts are settled and funds established.\nOn the other hand, they have no constitutional power of doing any thing\nmore than to recommend funds, and are persuaded that these will meet\nwith mountains of prejudice in some of the States.\n\nA considerable progress has been made in a plan for funding the public\ndebts; and it is to be hoped it will ere long go forth to the States,\nwith every argument that can give it success.\n\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\n                                                 With sincere respect,\n                                                 Your Excellencyâs\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo his Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                  Philadelphia, March 25, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nThe inclosed I write more in a public than in a private capacity. Here\nI write as a citizen, zealous for the true happiness of this country;\nas a soldier who feels what is due to an army which has suffered every\nthing, and done much for the safety of America.\n\nI sincerely wish _ingratitude_ was not so natural to the human heart\nas it is. I sincerely wish there were no seeds of it in those who\ndirect the councils of the United States. But while I urge the army to\nmoderation, and advise your Excellency to take the direction of their\ndiscontents, and endeavor to confine them within the bounds of duty,\nI cannot, as an honest man, conceal from you, that I am afraid their\ndistrusts have too much foundation. Republican jealousy has in it a\nprinciple of hostility to an army, whatever be their merits, whatever\nbe their claims to the gratitude of the community. It acknowledges\ntheir services with unwillingness, and rewards them with reluctance.\nI see this temper, though smothered with great care, involuntarily\nbreaking out upon too many occasions. I often feel a mortification,\nwhich it would be impolitic to express, that sets my passions at\nvariance with my reason. Too many, I perceive, if they could do it with\nsafety or color, would be glad to elude the just pretensions of the\narmy. I hope this is not the prevailing disposition.\n\nBut supposing the country ungrateful, what can the army do? It must\nsubmit to its hard fate. To seek redress by its arms would end in its\nruin. The army would moulder by its own weight, and for want of the\nmeans of keeping together: the soldiery would abandon their officers:\nthere would be no chance of success, without having recourse to means\nthat would reverse our revolution. I make these observations, not that\nI imagine your Excellency can want motives to continue your influence\nin the path of moderation; but merely to show why I cannot, myself,\nenter into the views of coercion which some gentlemen entertain. For I\nconfess, could force avail, I should almost wish to see it employed.\nI have an indifferent opinion of the honesty of this country, and ill\nforebodings as to its future system.\n\nYour Excellency will perceive I have written with sensations of\nchagrin, and will make allowance for coloring: but the general picture\nis too true. God send us all more wisdom.\n\n                                        I am, with very sincere respect,\n                                        Your Excellencyâs\n                                        Obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\nTo his Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Newburgh, March 31, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have duly received your favors of the seventeenth and twenty-fourth\nultimo. I rejoice, most exceedingly, that there is an end to our\nwarfare; and that such a field is opening to our view, as will, with\nwisdom to direct the cultivation of it, make us a great, a respectable,\nand happy people: but it must be improved by other means than State\npolitics and unreasonable jealousies and prejudices; or (it requires\nnot the second sight to see that) we shall be instruments in the hands\nof our enemies, and those European powers who may be jealous of our\ngreatness in union, to dissolve the Confederation. But to attain this,\nalthough the way seems extremely plain, is not so easy.\n\nMy wish to see the union of these States established upon liberal and\npermanent principles, and inclination to contribute my mite in pointing\nout the defects of the present constitution, are equally great. All\nmy private letters have teemed with these sentiments; and whenever\nthis topic has been the subject of conversation, I have endeavored to\ndiffuse and enforce them; but how far any further essay, by me, might\nbe productive of the wished for end, or appear to arrogate more than\nbelongs to me, depends so much upon popular opinion, and the temper\nand disposition of people, that it is not easy to decide. I shall be\nobliged to you, however, for the thoughts which you have promised me on\nthis subject, and as soon as you can make it convenient.\n\nNo man in the United States, is, or can be, more deeply impressed with\nthe necessity of a reform in our present Confederation, than myself; no\nman, perhaps, has felt the bad effects of it more sensibly: for, to the\ndefects thereof; and want of powers in Congress, may justly be ascribed\nthe prolongation of the war, and, consequently, the expenses occasioned\nby it. More than half the perplexities I have experienced in the course\nof my command, and almost the whole of the difficulties and distress of\nthe army, have their origin here: but still, the prejudices of some,\nthe designs of others, and the mere machinery of the majority, make\naddress and management necessary, to give weight to opinions which are\nto combat the doctrines of these different classes of men, in the field\nof politics.\n\nI would have been more full on this subject, but the bearer (in the\nclothing department) is waiting. I wish you may understand what I have\nwritten.\n\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             G. Washington.\n\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Newburgh, April 4, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe same post which gave me your two letters of the twenty-fifth of\nMarch, handed me one from Colonel Bland on the same point.\n\nObserving that both have been written at the desire of a committee\nof which you are both members, I have made a very full reply to\ntheir subject in my letter which is addressed to Colonel Bland; and,\nsupposing it unnecessary to enter into a complete detail to both, I\nmust beg leave to refer you to Colonel Blandâs (a sight of which I\nhave desired him to give you), for a full explanation of my ideas and\nsentiments.\n\nI read your private letter of the twenty-fifth with pain, and\ncontemplated the picture it had drawn with astonishment and horror:\nbut I will yet hope for the best. The idea of redress, by force, is\ntoo chimerical to have had a place in the imagination of any serious\nmind in this army; but there is no telling what unhappy disturbances\nmay result from distress, and distrust of justice: and as the fears\nand jealousies of the army are alive, I hope no resolution will be\ncome to, for disbanding or separating the lines, till the accounts\nare liquidated. You may rely upon it, sir, that unhappy consequences\nwould follow the attempt. The suspicions of the officers are afloat,\nnotwithstanding the resolutions which have passed on both sides. Any\nact, therefore, which can be construed into an attempt to separate them\nbefore the accounts are settled, will convey the most unfavorable ideas\nof the rectitude of Congress: whether well or ill founded, matters not;\nthe consequences will be the same.\n\nI will now, in strict confidence, mention a matter which may be\nuseful for you to be informed of. It is, that some men (and leading\nones, too) in this army, are beginning to entertain suspicions that\nCongress, or some members of it, regardless of the past sufferings\nand present distress, maugre the justice which is due to them, and\nthe returns which a grateful people should make to men who certainly\nhave contributed, more than any other class, to the establishment\nof Independency, are to be made use of as mere puppets to establish\nContinental funds; and that, rather than not succeed in this measure,\nor weaken their ground, they would make a sacrifice of the army and all\nits interests.\n\nI have two reasons for mentioning this matter to you: the one is, that\nthe army (considering the irritable state it is in, its sufferings,\nand composition) is a dangerous instrument to play with; the other,\nthat every possible means, consistent with their own views (which\ncertainly are moderate), should be essayed to get it disbanded without\ndelay. I might add a third: it is, that the Financier is suspected to\nbe at the bottom of this scheme. If sentiments of this sort should\nbecome general, their operation will be opposed to this plan, at the\nsame time that it would increase the present discontents. Upon the\nwhole, disband the army as soon as possible, but consult the wishes of\nit, which really are moderate in the mode, and perfectly compatible\nwith the honor, dignity, and justice, which is due from the country to\nit.\n\n                                   I am, with great esteem and regard,\n                                   Dear Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                   G. Washington.\n\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                                         April 11, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nI have received your Excellencyâs letters of the thirty-first of March,\nand fourth of April; the last to-day. The one to Colonel Bland, as\nmember of the committee, has been read in committee confidentially,\nand gave great satisfaction. The idea of not attempting to separate\nthe army before the settlement of accounts, corresponds with my\nproposition. That of endeavoring to let them have some pay, had\nalso appeared to me indispensable. The expectations of the army, as\nrepresented by your Excellency, are moderation itself. To-morrow we\nconfer with the Superintendent of Finance on the subject of money.\nThere will be difficulty, but not, we hope, insurmountable.\n\nI thank your Excellency for the hints you are so obliging as to give\nme in your private letter. I do not wonder at the suspicions that\nhave been infused; nor should I be surprised to hear, that I have\nbeen pointed out as one of the persons concerned in playing the game\ndescribed. But facts must speak for themselves. The gentlemen who were\nhere from the army, General McDougal, who is still here, will be able\nto give a true account of those who have supported the just claims of\nthe army, and of those who have endeavored to elude them.\n\nThere are two classes of men, sir, in Congress, of very different\nviews: one attached to State, the other to Continental politics. The\nlast have been strenuous advocates for funding the public debt upon\nsolid securities; the former have given every opposition in their\npower; and have only been dragged into the measures which are now near\nbeing adopted, by the clamors of the army and other public creditors.\n\nThe advocates for Continental funds, have blended the interests of\nthe army with other creditors, from a conviction, that no funds, for\npartial purposes, will go through those States to whose citizens the\nUnited States are largely indebted; or if they should be carried\nthrough, from impressions of the moment, would have the necessary\nstability: for the influence of those unprovided for, would always\nmilitate against a provision for others, in exclusion of them. It is in\nvain to tell men, who have parted with a large part of their property\non the public faith, that the services of the army are entitled to a\npreference: they would reason from their interest and their feelings:\nthese would tell them, that they had as great a title as any other\nclass of the community to public justice; and that while this was\ndenied to them, it would be unreasonable to make them bear their part\nof a burthen for the benefit of others. This is the way they would\nreason; and as their influence in some of the States was considerable,\nthey would have been able to prevent any partial provision.\n\nBut the question was not merely how to do justice to the creditors, but\nhow to restore public credit. Taxation, in this country, it was found,\nwould not supply a sixth part of the public necessities. The loans\nin Europe were far short of the balance, and the prospect every day\ndiminishing; the Court of France telling us, in plain terms, she could\nnot even do as much as she had done; individuals in Holland, and every\nwhere else, refusing to part with their money, on the precarious tenure\nof the mere faith of this country, without any pledge for the payment\neither of principal or interest.\n\nIn this situation what was to be done? It was essential to our cause,\nthat vigorous efforts should be made to restore public credit; it was\nnecessary to combine all the motives to this end, that could operate\nupon different descriptions of persons in the different States: the\nnecessities and discontents of the army presented themselves as a\npowerful engine.\n\nBut, sir, these gentlemen would be puzzled to support their\ninsinuations by a single fact. It was, indeed, proposed to appropriate\nthe intended impost on trade to the army debt; and, what was\nextraordinary, by gentlemen who had expressed their dislike to the\nprinciple of the fund. I acknowledge I was one that opposed this, for\nthe reasons already assigned, and for these additional ones: _That_ was\nthe fund on which we most counted; to obtain further loans in Europe,\nit was necessary we should have a fund sufficient to pay the interest\nof what had been borrowed, and what was to be borrowed. The truth was,\nthese people, in this instance, wanted to play off the army against the\nfunding system.\n\nAs to Mr. Morris, I will give your Excellency a true explanation of\nhis conduct. He had been for some time pressing Congress to endeavor\nto obtain funds, and had found a great backwardness in the business.\nHe found the taxes unproductive in the different States; he found the\nloans, in Europe, making a very slow progress; he found himself pressed\non all hands for supplies; he found himself, in short, reduced to this\nalternative, either of making engagements which he could not fulfil,\nor declaring his resignation in case funds were not established by a\ngiven time. Had he followed the first course, the bubble must soon\nhave burst; he must have sacrificed his credit and his character: and\npublic credit, already in a ruinous condition, would have lost its last\nsupport.\n\nHe wisely judged it better to resign: this might increase the\nembarrassments of the moment; but the necessity of the case, it was to\nbe hoped, would produce the proper measures; and he might then resume\nthe direction of the machine with advantage and success.\n\nHe also had some hope that his resignation would prove a stimulus to\nCongress.\n\nHe was, however, ill advised in the publication of his letters of\nresignation. This was an imprudent step, and has given a handle to his\npersonal enemies, who, by playing upon the passions of others, have\ndrawn some well-meaning men into the cry against him. But Mr. Morris\ncertainly deserves a great deal from his country. I believe no man in\nthis country, but himself, could have kept the money machine agoing\nduring the period he has been in office. From every thing that appears,\nhis administration has been upright as well as able.\n\nThe truth is, the old leaven of Deane and Lee, is, at this day, working\nagainst Mr. Morris. He happened, in that dispute, to have been on the\nside of Deane; and certain men can never forgive him. A man whom I once\nesteemed, and whom I will rather suppose _duped_ than wicked, is the\nsecond actor in this business.\n\nThe matter, with respect to the army, which has occasioned most\naltercation in Congress, and most dissatisfaction in the army, has\nbeen the half pay. The opinions on this head have been two: one party\nwas for referring the several lines to their States, to make such\ncommutation as they should think proper; the other, for making the\ncommutation by Congress, and funding it on Continental security. I was\nof this last opinion; and so were all those who will be represented as\nhaving made use of the army as puppets. Our principal reasons were,\n_Firstly_: By referring the lines to their respective States, those\nwhich were opposed to the half pay, would have taken advantage of\nthe officersâ necessities, to make the commutation far short of an\nequivalent. _Secondly_: The inequality which would have arisen in the\ndifferent States when the officers came to compare (as has happened in\nother cases), would have been a new source of discontent. _Thirdly_:\nSuch a reference was a continuance of the old wretched State system,\nby which the ties between Congress and the army have been nearly\ndissolved; by which the resources of the States have been diverted from\nthe common treasury, and wasted; a system which your Excellency has\noften justly reprobated.\n\nI have gone to these details, to give you a just idea of the parties\nin Congress. I assure you, upon my honor, sir, I have given you a\ncandid state of facts, to the best of my judgment. The men against\nwhom the suspicions you mention must be directed, are, in general,\nthe most sensible, the most liberal, the most independent, and\nthe most respectable characters in our body, as well as the most\nunequivocal friends to the army. In a word, they are the men who think\ncontinentally.\n\n                                        I have the honor to be,\n                                        With sincere respect and esteem,\n                                        Your Excellencyâs\n                                        Most obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\nP. S. I am chairman of a committee for peace arrangements. We shall\nask your Excellencyâs opinion at large, on a proper military peace\nestablishment. I will just hint to your Excellency, that our prejudices\nwill make us wish to keep up as few troops as possible.\n\nWe this moment learn, an officer is arrived from Sir Guy Carleton with\ndispatches; probably official accounts of peace.\n\n                                                                   A. H.\n\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                  Philadelphia, April 15, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nThere are two resolutions passed relative to the restoration of the\nBritish prisoners, and to making arrangements for the surrender of the\nposts in the possession of the British troops; the first of which\nis to be transacted by you in conjunction with the Secretary at War;\nthe latter by yourself alone. I will explain to you some doubts which\nhave arisen in Congress, with regard to the true construction of the\nprovisional treaty; which may be of use to you in transacting the\nbusiness above-mentioned.\n\nThe sixth article declares, that there shall be no future\nconfiscations, etc., after the _ratification of the Treaty in America_;\nand the seventh article makes the surrender of prisoners, evacuation of\nposts, cessation of hostilities, etc., to depend on that event, to wit,\n_the ratification of the treaty in America_.\n\nNow the doubt is, whether _the treaty_ means the provisional treaty\n_already concluded_, or the _definitive_ treaty _to be concluded_. The\nlast construction is most agreeable to the letter of the provisional\narticles; the former, most agreeable to the usual practice of nations:\nfor hostilities commonly cease on the ratification of the preliminary\ntreaty.\n\nThere is a great diversity of opinion in Congress. It will be, in my\nopinion, advisable, at the same time that we do not communicate our\ndoubts to the British, to extract their sense of the matter from them.\n\nThis may be done by asking them, at what periods they are willing to\nstipulate the surrender of posts; at the same time that they are asked,\nin what manner it will be the most convenient to them to receive the\nprisoners.\n\nIf they postpone the evacuation of the different posts to the\ndefinitive treaty, we shall then be justified in doing the same\nwith respect to prisoners. The question will then arise, Whether,\non principles of humanity, economy, and liberality, we ought not to\nrestore the prisoners, at all events, without delay? Much may be\nsaid on both sides. I doubt the expedience of a total restoration of\nprisoners, till they are willing to fix the epochs at which they will\ntake leave of us. It will add considerably to their strength; and\naccidents, though improbable, may happen.\n\nI confess, however, I am not clear in my opinion.\n\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\n                                                 Your Excellencyâs\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\nP.S. The provisional or preliminary treaty, is ratified by us--for the\ngreater caution.\n\n                                                                   A. H.\n\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Newborgh, April 16, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMy last letter to you was written in a hurry, when I was fatigued by\nthe more public, yet confidential, letter, which (with several others)\naccompanied it. Possibly, I did not, on that occasion, express myself\n(in what I intended as a hint) with so much perspicuity as I ought:\npossibly, too, what I then dropped, might have conveyed more than\nI intended; for I do not, at this time, recollect the force of my\nexpression.\n\nMy meaning, however, was only to inform, that there were different\nsentiments in the army, as well as in Congress, respecting Continental\nand State funds: some wishing to be thrown upon their respective\nStates, rather than the Continent at large, for payment; and that,\nif an idea should prevail, generally, that Congress, or part of its\nmembers, or ministers, bent upon the latter, should _delay_ doing\nthem justice, or _hazard_ it in pursuit of their favorite object; it\nmight create such divisions in the army, as would weaken, rather than\nstrengthen, the hands of those who were disposed to support Continental\nmeasures; and might _tend_ to defeat the end they themselves had in\nview by endeavoring to involve the army.\n\nFor these reasons I said, or meant to say, the army was a dangerous\nengine to work with, as it might be made to cut both ways; and,\nconsidering the sufferings of it, would, more than probably, throw its\nweight into that scale which seemed most likely to preponderate towards\nits immediate relief, without looking forward (under the pressure of\npresent wants) to future consequences with the eyes of politicians. In\nthis light, also, I meant to apply my observations to Mr. Morris, to\nwhom, or rather to Mr. G---- M----, is ascribed, in a great degree, the\ngroundwork of the superstructure which was intended to be raised in the\narmy by the anonymous addresses.\n\nThat no man can be more opposed to State funds and local prejudices\nthan myself, the whole tenor of my conduct has been one continual\nevidence of. No man, perhaps, has had better opportunities to _see_,\nand to _feel_, the pernicious tendency of the latter than I have; and\nI endeavor (I hope not altogether ineffectually) to inculcate them\nupon the officers of the army, upon all proper occasions: but their\nfeelings are to be attended to and soothed; and they assured, that if\nContinental funds cannot be established, they will be recommended to\ntheir respective States for payment. Justice must be done them.\n\nI should do injustice to reports, and what I believe to be the opinion\nof the army, were I not to inform you, that they consider you as a\nfriend, zealous to serve them, and one who has espoused their interests\nin Congress, upon every proper occasion. It is to be wished, as I\nobserved in my letter to Colonel Bland, that Congress would send\na committee to the army with plenipotentiary powers. The matters\nrequested of me, in your letter of the â â, as chairman of a committee,\nand many other things, might then be brought to a close, with more\ndespatch, and in a happier manner, than it is likely they will be by\nan intercourse of letters at the distance of one hundred and fifty\nmiles: which takes _our_ Expresses, a week, _at least_, to go and come.\nAt this moment, being without any instructions from Congress, I am\nunder great embarrassment with respect to the soldiers for the war;\nand shall be obliged, more than probably, from the necessity of the\ncase, to exercise my own judgment without waiting for orders, as to the\ndischarge of them. If I should adopt measures which events may approve,\nall will be well. If otherwise, Why and by what authority did you do so?\n\nHow far a _strong_ recommendation from Congress, to observe _all_\nthe Articles of Peace, as well as the â â, may imply a suspicion of good\nfaith in the people of this country, I pretend not to judge: but I am\nmuch mistaken, if something of the kind will not be found wanting; as\nI already perceive a disposition to carp at, and to elude, such parts\nof the treaty as affect their different interests; although you do not\nfind a man, who, when pushed, will not acknowledge, that, upon the\n_whole_, it is a more advantageous Peace than we could possibly have\nexpected.\n\n                                           I am, dear Sir,\n                                           With great esteem and regard,\n                                           Your most obedient servant,\n                                           G. Washington.\n\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Newburgh, April 22, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI did not receive your letter of the fifteenth, till after my return\nfrom Ringwood, where I had a meeting with the Secretary at War, for\nthe purpose of making arrangements for the release of our prisoners,\nagreeably to the resolve of Congress of the fifteenth instant.\n\nFinding a diversity of opinion respecting the treaty, and the line\nof conduct we ought to observe with the prisoners, I requested, in\nprecise terms, to know from General Lincoln (before I entered on the\nbusiness), whether we were to exercise our own judgment with respect\nto the _time_, as well as the _mode_, of releasing them; or were to be\nconfined to the latter: being informed that we had no option in the\nfirst, Congress wishing to be eased of the expense as soon as possible,\nI acted _solely_ on that ground.\n\nAt the same time, I scruple not to confess to you, that if this measure\nwas not dictated by necessity, it is, in my opinion, an impolitic\none; as we place ourselves in the power of the British, before the\ntreaty is definitive. The manner in which Peace was first announced,\nand the subsequent declarations of it, have led the country and army\ninto a belief, that it was final. The ratification of the preliminary\narticles, on the third of February, so far confirmed this, that one\nconsequence resulting from it, is, the soldiers for the war, conceive\nthe term of their services has actually expired; and I believe it is\nnot in the power of Congress, or their officers, to hold them much,\nif any, longer; for we are obliged, at this moment, to increase our\nguards, to prevent rioting, and the insults which the officers meet\nwith, in attempting to hold them to their duty. The proportion of\nthese men, amount to seven-elevenths of this army: these we shall lose\nat the moment the British army will receive, by their prisoners, an\naugmentation of five or six thousand men.\n\nIt is not for me to investigate the causes which induced this measure;\nnor the policy of those letters (from authority) which gave the _ton_\nto the present sentiment; but since they have been adopted, we ought,\nin my opinion, to put a good face upon matters; and, by a liberal\nconduct throughout, on our part (freed from appearances of distrust)\ntry if we cannot excite similar dispositions on theirs. Indeed,\ncircumstanced as things _now_ are, I wish, most fervently, that all\nthe troops which are not retained for a Peace Establishment, were\nto be discharged immediately, or such of them, at least, as do not\nincline to await the settlement of their accounts. If they continue\nhere, their claims, I can plainly perceive, will increase; and our\nperplexities multiply. A petition is this moment handed to me, from the\nnon-commissioned officers of the Connecticut line, soliciting half pay.\nIt is well drawn, I am told, but I did not read it. I sent it back,\nwithout appearing to understand the contents, because it did not come\nthrough the channel of their officers. This may be followed by others:\nand I mention it, to show the necessity, the absolute necessity, of\ndischarging the _Warsmen_ as soon as possible.\n\nI have taken much pains to support Mr. Morrisâs administration in the\narmy; and, in proportion to its numbers, I believe he had not more\nfriends any where: but if he will neither adopt the mode which has\nbeen suggested, point out any other, nor show cause why the first is\neither impracticable or impolitic (I have heard he objects to it),\nthey will certainly attribute their disappointment to a lukewarmness\nin him, or some design incompatible with their interests. And here, my\ndear Colonel Hamilton, let me assure you, that it would not be more\ndifficult to still the raging billows in a tempestuous gale, than to\nconvince the officers of this army, of the justice, or policy, of\npaying men, in civil offices, full wages, when _they_ cannot obtain a\nsixtieth part of their dues.\n\nI am not unapprised of the arguments which are made use of, upon this\noccasion, to discriminate the cases: but they really are futile; and\nmay be summed up in this: that though both are contending for the same\nrights, and expect equal benefits, yet, both cannot submit to the same\ninconveniences to obtain them: otherwise, to adopt the language of\nsimplicity and plainness, a ration of salt pork, with or without pease,\nas the case often is, would support the one as well as the other; and,\nin such a struggle as ours, would, in my opinion, be alike honorable in\nboth.\n\nMy anxiety to get home, increases with the prospect of it. But when\nis it to happen? I have not heard that Congress have yet had under\nconsideration, the lands, and other gratuities, which, at different\nperiods of the war, have been promised to the army. Do not these things\nevince the necessity of a committeeâs repairing to camp, in order to\narrange and adjust matters without spending time in a tedious exchange\nof letters? Unless something of this kind is adopted, business will\nbe delayed, and expenses accumulated; or the army will break up in\ndisorder, go home enraged, complaining of injustice, and committing\nenormities on the innocent inhabitants in every direction.\n\nI write to you unreservedly. If, therefore, contrary to my\napprehension, all these matters are in a proper train, and Mr. Morris\nhas devised means to give the army three monthsâ pay, you will, I am\npersuaded, excuse my precipitancy and solicitude, by ascribing it to\nan earnest wish to see the war happily and honorably terminated; to\nmy anxious desire of enjoying some repose; and the necessity of my\npaying a little attention to my private concerns, which have suffered\nconsiderably in eight yearsâ absence.\n\nMâHenry, expressing, in a letter I have lately received from him, a\nwish to be appointed official Secretary to the Court of Versailles, or\nLondon, I have, by this opportunity, written to Mr. Livingston, and Mr.\nMadison, speaking of him in warm terms; and wish him success with all\nmy heart.\n\n                                           I am, dear Sir,\n                                           With great esteem and regard,\n                                           Your most obedient servant,\n                                           G. Washington.\n\nColonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOV. CLINTON.\n\n\n                                    Philadelphia, May 14, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nThe President of Congress will of course have transmitted to your\nExcellency, the plan lately adopted by Congress for funding the public\ndebt. This plan was framed to accommodate it to the objections of\nsome of the States; but this spirit of accommodation will only serve\nto render it less efficient, without making it more palatable. The\nopposition of the State of Rhode Island, for instance, is chiefly\nfounded upon these two considerations: the merchants are opposed to any\nrevenue from trade; and the State, depending almost wholly on commerce,\nwants to have credit for the amount of the duties.\n\nPersuaded that the plan now proposed will have little more chance of\nsuccess than a better one; and that, if agreed to by all the States,\nit will, in a great measure, fail in the execution, it received my\nnegative. My principal objections were,\n\n_Firstly_: That it does not designate the funds (except the impost)\non which the whole interest is to arise; and by which (selecting\nthe capital articles of visible property) the collection would have\nbeen easy, the funds productive, and necessarily increasing with the\nincrease of the country.\n\n_Secondly_: That the duration of the funds is not coextensive with\nthe debt, but limited to twenty-five years; though there is a moral\ncertainty, that, in that period, the principal will not, by the present\nprovision, be fairly extinguished.\n\n_Thirdly_: That the nomination and appointment of the collectors of\nthe revenue are to reside in each State, instead of, at least the\nnomination, being in the United States; the consequence of which will\nbe, that those States which have little interest in the funds, by\nhaving a small share of the public debt due to their own citizens, will\ntake care to appoint such persons as are least likely to collect the\nrevenue.\n\nThe evils resulting from these defects, will be, that in many instances\nthe objects of the revenues will be improperly chosen, and will consist\nof a multitude of little articles, which will, on experiment, prove\ninsufficient; that for want of a vigorous collection in each State, the\nrevenue will be unproductive in many, and will fall chiefly upon those\nStates which are governed by most liberal principles; that for want of\nan adequate security, the evidences of the public debt, will not be\ntransferable for any thing like their value; that this not admitting\nan incorporation of the creditors in the nature of Banks, will deprive\nthe public of the benefit of an increased circulation, and of course\nwill disable the people from paying the taxes for want of a sufficient\nmedium.\n\nI shall be happy to be mistaken in my apprehensions; but the experiment\nmust determine.\n\nI hope our State will consent to the plan proposed; because it is her\ninterest, at all events, to promote the payment of the public debt on\nContinental funds (independent of the general considerations of union\nand propriety).\n\nI am much mistaken if the debts due from the United States to the\ncitizens of the State of New-York, do not considerably exceed its\nproportion of the necessary funds: of course it has an immediate\ninterest that there should be a Continental provision for them. But\nthere are superior motives that ought to operate in every State; the\nobligations of national faith, honor, and reputation.\n\nIndividuals have been already too long sacrificed to public\nconvenience. It will be shocking, and indeed an eternal reproach to\nthis country, if we begin the peaceable enjoyment of our independence\nby a violation of all the principles of honesty and true policy.\n\nIt is worthy of remark, that at least four-fifths of the domestic debt,\nare due to the citizens of the States (from Pennsylvania inclusively)\nnorthward.\n\n                                            I have the honor to be, Sir,\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\n                                            A. Hamilton.\n\nP. S. It is particularly interesting that the State should have a\nrepresentation here. Not only many matters are depending which require\na full representation in Congress (and there is now a thin one), but\nthose matters are of a nature so particularly interesting to our State,\nthat we ought not to be without a voice in them. I wish two other\ngentlemen of the delegation may appear as soon as possible; for it\nwould be very injurious for me to remain much longer here. Having no\nfuture views in public life, I owe it to myself, without delay to enter\nupon the care of my private concerns in earnest.\n\n                                                                   A. H.\n\nTo His Excellency Governor Clinton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\n\n\n                                    Philadelphia, June 1, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nIn my last letter to your Excellency, I took occasion to mention,\nthat it was of great importance to the State, at this time, to have a\nrepresentation here, as points in which, by its present situation, it\nis particularly interested, are daily, and will be daily, agitated.\n\nIt is also of importance, at this moment, to the United States; (not\nonly from general considerations, but) because we have a very thin\nrepresentation in Congress, and are frequently unable to transact any\nof those matters which require nine States. I wish your Excellency\nwould urge a couple of gentlemen to come on, as it becomes highly\ninconvenient to me to remain here, and as I have staid the full time to\nbe expected.\n\nI observe, with great regret, the intemperate proceedings among the\npeople in different parts of the State, in violation of a treaty, the\nfaithful observance of which so deeply interests the United States.\n\nSurely, the State of New-York, with its capital and its frontier posts\n(on which its important fur trade depends) in the hands of the British\ntroops, ought to take care that nothing is done to furnish a pretext\non the other side, even for delaying, much less for refusing, the\nexecution of the treaty. We may imagine that the situation of Great\nBritain puts her under a necessity, at all events, of fulfilling her\nengagements, and cultivating the good will of this country.\n\nThis is, no doubt, her true policy; but when we feel that passion makes\nus depart from the dictates of reason; when we have seen that passion\nhas had so much influence in the conduct of the British Councils,\nin the whole course of the war; when we recollect, that those who\ngovern them, are men like ourselves, and alike subject to passions and\nresentments; when we reflect, also, that all the great men in England\nare not united in the liberal scheme of policy with respect to this\ncountry, and that in the anarchy which prevails, there is no knowing to\nwhom the reins of government may be committed; when we recollect how\nlittle in a condition we are, to enforce a compliance with our claims;\nwe ought, certainly, to be cautious in what manner we act, especially\nwhen we, in particular, have so much at stake; and should not openly\nprovoke a breach of faith on the other side, by setting the example.\n\nAn important distinction is not sufficiently attended to. The fifth\narticle is recommendatory; the sixth positive. There is no option, on\nthe part of the particular States, as to any future confiscations,\nprosecutions, or injuries of any kind, to person, liberty, or property,\non account of any thing done in the war. It is matter of discretion\nin the States, whether they will comply with the recommendations\ncontained in the fifth article; but no part of the sixth can be\ndeparted from by them, without a direct breach of public faith, and\nof the Confederation. The power of making treaties is exclusively\nlodged in Congress. That power includes whatever is essential to the\ntermination of the war, and to the preservation of the general safety.\nIndemnity to individuals in similar cases, is a _usual_ stipulation in\ntreaties of peace, of which many precedents are to be produced.\n\nShould it be said, that the associations of the people, without legal\nauthority, do not amount to a breach of the public faith; the answer\nis, If the government does not repress them, and prevent their having\neffect, it is as much a breach, as a formal refusal to comply on its\npart. In the eye of a foreign nation, if our engagements are broken,\nit is of no moment whether it is for the want of good intention in the\ngovernment, or for want of power to restrain its subjects.\n\nSuppose a violence committed by an American vessel on the vessel of\nanother nation, upon the high seas, and after complaint made there is\nno redress given: Is not this a hostility against the injured nation\nwhich will justify reprisals?\n\nBut if I am not misinformed, there are violations going on in form of\nlaw. I am told that indictments continue to be brought under the former\nconfiscation laws: A palpable infraction, if true, of the sixth article\nof the treaty; to which an immediate stop ought, no doubt, to be put.\n\nIt has been said by some men, that the operation of this treaty is\nsuspended till the definitive treaty: A plain subterfuge. Whatever\nis clearly expressed in the provisional or preliminary treaty, is as\nbinding from the moment it is made, as the definitive treaty; which, in\nfact, only developes, explains and fixes, more precisely, what may have\nbeen too generally expressed in the former.\n\nSuppose the British should now send away, not only the negroes, but\nall other property, and all the public records in their possession\nbelonging to us, on the pretence above stated: should we not justly\naccuse them with breaking faith? Is this not already done in the case\nof the negroes who have been carried away, though founded upon a very\ndifferent principle, a doubtful construction of the treaty, not a\ndenial of its immediate operation?\n\nIn fine, Is it our interest to advance this doctrine, and to\ncountenance the position, that nothing is binding till the definitive\ntreaty, when there are examples of _years_ intervening between the\npreliminary and definitive treaties?\n\nSir Guy Carleton, in his correspondence, has appeared to consider the\ntreaty as immediately obligatory: and it has been the policy which I\nhave pursued, to promote the same idea.\n\nI am not, indeed, apprehensive of a renewal of the war, for peace\nis necessary to Great Britain. I think it also most probable, her\ndisposition to conciliate this country will outweigh the resentments\nwhich a breach of our engagements is calculated to inspire. But with a\ntreaty which has exceeded the hopes of the most sanguine; which, in the\narticles of boundary and the fisheries, is even better than we asked;\ncircumstanced, too, as this country is, with respect to the means of\nmaking war; I think it the height of imprudence to run any risk. Great\nBritain, without recommencing hostilities, may evade parts of the\ntreaty. She may keep possession of the frontier posts; she may obstruct\nthe free enjoyment of the fisheries; she may be indisposed to such\nextensive concessions, in matters of commerce, as it is our interest\nto aim at. In all this she would find no opposition from any foreign\npower: and we are not in a condition to oblige her to any thing. If we\nimagine that France, obviously embarrassed herself, in her finances,\nwould renew the war to oblige Great Britain to the restoration of\nfrontier posts; or to a compliance with the stipulations respecting\nthe fisheries (especially after a manifest breach of the treaty on\nour part); we speculate much at random. Observations might be made\non the last article, which would prove, that it is not the policy of\nFrance to support our interest there. Are we prepared, for the mere\ngratification of our resentments, to put those great national objects\nto the hazard; to leave our western frontier in a state of insecurity;\nto relinquish the fur trade; and to abridge our pretensions to the\nfisheries? Do we think national character so light a thing, as to be\nwilling to sacrifice the public faith to individual animosity? Let\nthe case be fairly stated: Great Britain and America, two independent\nnations, at war. The former in possession of considerable posts and\ndistricts of territory, belonging to the latter; and also of the means\nof obstructing certain commercial advantages in which it is deeply\ninterested.\n\nBut it is not uncommon, in treaties of peace, for the _uti possidetis_\nto take place. Great Britain, however, in the present instance,\nstipulates to restore all our posts and territories in her possession.\nShe even adds an extent, not within our original claims, more than a\ncompensation for a small part ceded in another quarter. She agrees to\nre-admit us to a participation in the fisheries. What equivalent do we\ngive for this? Congress are to recommend the restoration of property\nto those who have adhered to her; and expressly engage, that no future\ninjury shall be done them, in person, liberty, or property. This is\nthe sole condition, on our part, where there is not an immediate\nreciprocity (the recovery of debts, and liberation of prisoners,\nbeing mutual; the former, indeed, only declaring what the rights of\nprivate faith, which all civilized nations hold sacred, would have\ndeclared without it), and stands as the single equivalent for all the\nrestitutions and concessions to be made by Great Britain. Will it be\nhonest in us to violate this condition, or will it be prudent to put it\nin competition with all the important matters to be performed on the\nother side?\n\nWill foreign nations be willing to undertake any thing with us, or for\nus, when they find that the nature of our governments will allow no\ndependence to be placed upon our engagements? I have omitted saying\nany thing of the impolicy of inducing, by our severity, a great number\nof useful citizens, whose situations do not make them a proper object\nof resentment, to abandon the country, to form settlements that will\nhereafter become our rivals, animated with a hatred to us, which will\ndescend to their posterity. Nothing, however, can be more unwise than\nto contribute, as we are doing, to people the shores and wilderness of\nNova Scotia; a colony which, by its position, will become a competitor\nwith us, among other things, in that branch of commerce on which our\nnavigation and navy will essentially depend: I mean the fisheries; in\nwhich, I have no doubt, the State of New-York will, hereafter, have a\nconsiderable share.\n\nTo your Excellency I freely deliver my sentiments, because I\nam persuaded you cannot be a stranger to the force of these\nconsiderations. I fear not even to hazard them to the justice and good\nsense of those whom I have the honor to represent. I esteem it my duty\nto do it, because the question is important to the interests of the\nState, in its relation to the United States.\n\nThose who consult only their passions, might choose to construe what\nI say, as too favorable to a set of men who have been the enemies of\nthe public liberty: but those for whose esteem I am most concerned,\nwill acquit me of any personal considerations; and will perceive that I\nonly urge the cause of national honor, safety, and advantage. We have\nassumed an independent station: we ought to feel, and to act, in a\nmanner consistent with the dignity of that station.\n\nI anxiously wish to see every prudent measure taken to prevent those\ncombinations which will certainly disgrace us, if they do not involve\nus in other calamities. Whatever distinctions are judged necessary to\nbe made, in the cases of those persons who have been in opposition\nto the common cause, let them be made by legal authority, on a fair\nconstruction of the treaty, consistent with national faith and national\nhonor.\n\nYour Excellency will have been informed, that Congress have instructed\nGeneral Washington to garrison the frontier posts, when surrendered,\nwith the three yearsâ Continental troops. This is more for the interest\nof the State, than to have them garrisoned at its particular expense:\nand I should wish that permanent provision might be made on the same\nprinciple. I wait to see whether any Continental peace establishment\nfor garrisons, etc., will take place, before I engage the consent of\nCongress to a separate provision.\n\nI cannot forbear adding a word on the subject of money. The only\nreliance we now have for redeeming a large anticipation on the public\ncredit, already made, and making, for the benefit of the army, is\non the taxes coming in. The collection, hitherto, is out of all\nproportion to the demand. It is of vast consequence, at this juncture,\nthat every thing possible should be done to forward it. I forbear\nentering into details which would be very striking upon this subject. I\nwill only say, that unless there is a serious exertion in the States,\npublic credit must ere long receive another shock very disagreeable in\nits consequences.\n\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\n                                                 With perfect respect,\n                                                 Your Excellencyâs\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\nTo His Excellency Governor Clinton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO REED.\n\n\n                                                                   1783.\n\nSir:\n\nHaving always entertained an esteem for you personally, I could not,\nwithout reluctance, yield to impressions that might weaken that\nsentiment: and it is with pain I find myself drawn, by circumstances,\nto animadvert upon the late message from the Executive Council to the\nAssembly of Pennsylvania relative to the mutiny, in a manner which may\nseem to impeach the candor of those who were the authors of it.\n\nBut it will be impossible for persons who have read the report of the\ncommittee, and the message of the Council, however inclined to make\nallowances for the force of involuntary bias, not to conclude, that\non one side or the other, the facts have been wilfully discolored.\nI decline any attempt to set the public opinion right upon this\nsubject; because, after all that can be said, the judgments of men will\neventually be determined by personal and party prepossessions. So far\nas I am concerned, I persuade myself those who are acquainted with me,\nwill place entire confidence in my fairness and veracity. I doubt not\nyour Excellencyâs friends will be equally partial to you, and those\nof the Council to them. But though I should despair of rectifying\nor fixing the public opinion, by an appeal to the public; and though\nI have seen too much of the ridicule thrown upon such appeals, from\nmen in official stations, and of the ill effect they have had upon\nthe national character, not to be willing to sacrifice the desire of\njustifying myself to considerations of prudence and propriety; yet I\ncannot forbear indulging my feelings so far as to enter into a few\nexplanations with your Excellency; submitting the justness of them to\nthe testimony of your own mind.\n\nAs this is a mere private discussion, I address myself to your\nExcellency in particular; and the rather, as, from the style and manner\nof the message, I take it for granted you had the principal agency in\nit: and I shall consider, on the same grounds, the notes in â â â[20]\npaper of the â â â[20], as a comment on the report of the committee by\nyourself; in aid of the message.\n\nI take up the matter individually, because I mean to treat it on a\nprivate footing; and because, though I do not acknowledge any peculiar\nresponsibility, it happened to be my lot, as chairman, principally to\nconduct the conferences on the part of the committee.\n\nI regard the whole of this business as a most unfortunate one; in\nwhich, probably, none of the actors will acquire great credit. I\ndeplore it, as tending to interrupt the harmony between Congress and\na respectable, a meritorious member of the Union. Who were right, or\nwho were wrong, is a question of less importance, than how mutual\nirritations may be best healed. Whatever revives, or continues, the\nformer, is to be regretted. I lament to be under an inducement to\ndiscuss circumstances that relate to it in the remotest degree. Nothing\nbut an attack upon the ingenuousness of my conduct, could have called\nme to it. Its prudence, either collectively or individually, would\npatiently have been consigned to the lash of censure and criticism,\nmerited or unmerited.\n\nHappily, in the present case, the members of the committee have a\nstrong ground, from which they cannot easily be forced. Apprehensive\nof misconception, I will not say of misrepresentation, they tried\nto render it impossible by written documents. The presumption, with\nimpartial minds, cannot fail to be in favor of that side which gave so\ndecisive a proof of its disposition to fairness, as to endeavor to put\nit out of its own power to misrepresent.\n\nThe professed scruples of the Council, cannot be admitted to have any\nweight. Usage, and the plainest rules of propriety, will dictate, that\nit never could have wounded the dignity, or delicacy, of the executive\nof any State, to have given to a committee of Congress, appointed\nto confer on a subject of moment, a written answer to a request in\nwriting after previous explanations. The fact stated speaks for itself.\nThe consequences show, that the precaution of the committee was well\njudged; and that it would have been well for the Council to have\nconcurred.\n\nIn the present case it might be observed, that there was, in the first\ninstance, a written application from Congress to the Council, in the\ncustomary form of resolutions: and though a committee was authorized to\nconfer and explain, a formal and authentic answer might reasonably have\nbeen expected by Congress; and, when desired by the committee, should\nhave been understood as desired on their behalf.\n\nThere is an awkwardness in reasoning upon self-evident positions; but\nas the Council have, by their conduct in the first instance, and by\ntheir message since, put forward a doubt upon the subject, and made it\na point of importance, I shall be excused for examining it a little\nfurther. On what could the objection of the Council be founded? They\nsay it had been unusual. Admitting the fact, was the mere novelty of\nthe thing a sufficient reason against it? If there was no apparent\ninconvenience in making a new precedent; if; on the contrary, there was\na manifest convenience in it; ought not such a punctilio to have given\nway to considerations of utility?\n\nWas it derogatory to the dignity of the Council? Surely, if they\ncommunicate in writing with the executive servants of Congress, even\nthose in subordinate stations, as is the practice of every day, and as\nis indispensable to the prosecution of public business, they might, at\nless expense of dignity, pursue the same mode with a part of that body\nitself.\n\nThe distinction taken by the Council, in their message to the\nAssembly, respecting the responsibility of such executive officers,\nas not applicable to a committee, if it amounts to any thing, proves\nonly this: That such officers ought, in prudence, to take greater\nprecautions for their own justification than a committee of Congress\nneed to do. It is not to be inferred, if a committee of Congress,\nacting ministerially, think it expedient to use circumspection, that\nthose with whom they are transacting business, can, with propriety,\nrefuse to join with them in that mode which is best adapted to\nprecision and certainty.\n\nBut, indeed, the ground of distinction is erroneous. A committee of\nCongress act in a ministerial capacity, and are therefore responsible\nto the body to which they belong, as well as the servants of that\nbody, though in a different manner. If it be said they do not act\nministerially, but stand in the place of Congress; then the Council,\nupon their own principles, ought to have complied with their request.\n\nTo diminish the exceptionableness of their refusal, it is true,\nas stated by the Council, that though they said they could not\n_condescend_ to do what the committee had asked; yet they declared\nthemselves willing to _grant_ an answer in writing, if Congress should\nrequest it; and that they proposed, that the committee should put their\nverbal answer in writing, to be afterwards perused and examined by them.\n\nThe answer of the committee, as I doubt not your Excellency will\nrecollect, was, as to the first point, that Congress in all probability\nwould not make the request, having determined (as the Council had been\nalready informed) not to resume their deliberations in the city, till\neffectual measures had been taken to suppress the mutiny; and should\nthey assemble, would naturally feel a delicacy in requesting what had\nbeen denied to their committee. And as to the second point, that the\nCouncil having judged it inexpedient to give a written answer, the\ncommittee would content themselves with making the most accurate\nreport in their power, relying upon the confidence of the body to which\nthey belonged, and upon the candor of the Council.\n\nYour Excellency is too good a judge of human nature, as well as of the\nforce of language, not to have perceived at the time, the effect which\nthe refusal of the Council had upon my mind. I own it struck me, either\nas an uncandid reserve, or an unbecoming stateliness; and, in either\nsupposition, a disrespect to the body of which the committee were\nmembers.\n\nThough nothing enters less into my temper than an inclination to\nfetter business by punctilio, after the Council had discovered such\noverweening nicety, I should have thought it a degradation to my\nofficial character, to have consented to their proposal.\n\nThe desire of self-justification is so natural, that I should not have\nbeen surprised to have seen the transactions which are the subject of\nthe Councilâs message, receive a coloring favorable to their purpose:\nbut I did not expect to find material facts either suppressed or denied.\n\nThe report made by the committee on the first interview with the\nCouncil, was, I acknowledge, from memory, and therefore I admit a\npossibility of error; but, so far as my memory can be relied on, the\nrepresentation was just. And I am certain that there is a mistake in\nthe insinuation, that the circumstance of the message sent to Congress\nby the Board of Sergeants, was not mentioned at all to the Council;\nfor I have a note of it, taken immediately after the first conference\nsubsequent to the mutiny. The affair, by the event of â â â, having\nassumed a more serious aspect, I kept a regular minute of the\nproceedings; a summary of which, made up our report to Congress, and\nwhich I shall annex, at large, to this letter for your Excellencyâs\nperusal.\n\nThe message entirely omits the declaration of the Council, that\n\n ... ... ... [21];\n\nand the note says, that the Council only declared,\nâThat they could not be sure, that such another insult would produce\nthose exertions.â[22] The difference in this article is of great\nimportance. The declaration made so deep an impression at the time,\nthat almost the precise words remained in my memory. They were twice\nrepeated, as well when we saw your Excellency alone, in your own house,\nin the morning, as when you delivered to us, in the Council chamber,\nthe determination of the Council.\n\nMr. Ellsworth[23], in half an hour afterwards, repeated them to several\nmembers of Congress assembled at the Presidentâs house; and in a few\nhours from that time I committed them to writing. I cannot suppose your\nExcellencyâs recollection fails you in this particular; and I must\npointedly appeal to your candor.\n\nTo show the inaccuracy with which the report of the committee was\ncomposed, it is observed, in the notes with respect to that part which\nrelates to the commission given by the mutineers to the officers whom\nthey had chosen to represent them, that only two hours had intervened\nbetween that event and the conference with the Council; and that it\nwas very improbable the knowledge of it could have so early reached\nthe committee. It is added, that none of the Council remembers to have\nheard a single syllable respecting it, during the whole conference.\n\nAs to the argument drawn from the short interval between the delivery\nof the commission and the conference, it will be sufficient to say,\nthat the committee held a constant communication with General St.\nClair, and that he kept a vigilant eye upon all the motions of the\nmutineers; that his access to them was easy; that the fact in question\nwas a matter of immediate notoriety; that two hours were abundant time\nfor a thing of that nature to be conveyed from the barracks to General\nSt. Clairâs quarters; and that one of the committee had actually seen,\nand obtained the intelligence from him, a little time before the\ninterview with the Council commenced.\n\nIt is much more extraordinary that the Council should have been\napprised of it so late, than that the committee should have known it\nso early. As to the memory of the Council, it is unfortunate it should\nhave been so fallible as it is said to have been: but I would rather\nsuppose, âin the quick succession of circumstances,â the matter had\nescaped recollection, than that my minutes, as well as my memory,\nshould have deceived me. I well recollect, also, that your Excellency,\nwhen it was mentioned, acknowledged that it rather contradicted the\npacific appearance which the conduct of the troops, in other respects,\nwore.\n\nThese are the essential differences, in point of fact, between the\nreport of the committee, and the message of Council: the whole\ncomplexion, indeed, of one, materially varies from the other; but the\nmost common observer must have noticed, how different an aspect the\nsame facts will bear, differently dressed and arranged. It was to avoid\nthis, we proposed to reduce them to writing: but as this has not been\ndone, spectators must judge, from the situation of the parties, and the\ncourse of the transactions, which side has given the justest relation.\n\nI cannot, however, forbear remarking, that I see expressions of\ncivility, on the part of the committee, making a figure in the message,\nvery different from their genuine intention; being introduced in a\nmanner that gives them the air of concessions in favor of the conduct\nof the Council. Your Excellency will certainly recollect, that the\ncommittee were very remote from a concurrence in sentiment with the\nCouncil; and though they did not presume to judge of the disposition of\nthe citizens, strongly urged the expedience and necessity of calling\nout the militia, and facility of employing them with success against\nan unofficered and disorderly body of mutinous soldiers. It is true,\nalso, that they acknowledged the candor with which the Council exposed\nto them, what they deemed the temper of their citizens, and their own\ndifficulties and embarrassments; which were, no doubt, delineated\nwith great energy of language, and display of circumstances: but they\ncertainly never admitted the candor of refusing an answer in writing,\nwhich was a part of the _business_ transacted with the Council; nor\ndid they _withdraw_, without giving an intelligible intimation of\ntheir sense of this proceeding. I was also surprised to see any part of\nthe private and confidential conversation I had with your Excellency,\nushered into the message from the Council; and moulded into such a\nshape, as to imply, by an obvious construction, an approbation of\ntheir reasons. Your Excellency will admit the following state of this\ntransaction to be a just one.\n\nI waited upon the Council to correct a piece of information I had\ngiven them respecting ammunition: but even this is misstated, as will\nbe seen by my minutes. Having done this, my official business ended;\nwhen I was taken aside by your Excellency, and a conversation passed\nin declared confidence. You informed me, that a meeting of the militia\nofficers was then holding, and in consultation with the Council about\neventual measures (in consequence, as I conjectured, of a communication\nto you, the preceding evening, from the delegates of the State, of the\nintention of Congress to remove from the city, in case they did not\nreceive satisfactory assurances of support). You added, that you hoped\nnothing would be precipitated; but that proper allowances would be made\nfor the situation of the Council.\n\nI understood your observations with reference to the departure of\nCongress, and replied to this effect: That I viewed the departure of\nCongress as a delicate measure, including consequences important to\nthe national character abroad, and critical with respect to the State\nof Pennsylvania, and, in particular, the city of Philadelphia; that\nthe triumph of a handful of mutinous soldiers, permitted in a place\nwhich is considered as the capital of America, to surround, and, in\nfact, imprison Congress, without the least effort, on the part of the\ncitizens, to uphold their dignity and authority, so as to oblige them\nto remove from the place which had been their residence during the\nRevolution, would, it was to be feared, be viewed at a distance, as a\ngeneral disaffection of the citizens to the Federal Government; might\ndiscredit its negotiations, and affect the national interests: that,\nat home, it might give a deep wound to the reputation of Pennsylvania;\nmight draw upon it the resentments of the other States, and sow discord\nbetween Congress and the State; that the removal of Congress would\nprobably bring the affair to a crisis; and, by convincing the mutineers\nthat extremities were intended, would either intimidate them into a\nsubmission, or determine them to immediate excesses; that, impressed\nwith these considerations, and still hoping, notwithstanding some\nappearances to the contrary, that the mutineers might be sincere in\ntheir professions of submission, or that the Council, on further\nexamination, would find it in their power to act with vigor, I\nhad declined giving my assent to a report in writing, which would\nnecessarily be followed by the departure of Congress; that though the\ncommittee had no discretion, by the powers under which they acted, but\nwere bound by the tenor of their instructions, the moment they did not\nreceive âsatisfactory assurances of prompt and adequate exertions, on\nthe part of the State, for supporting the public authority,â to advise\nthe adjournment of Congress to Trenton or Princeton; and I therefore\nconsidered the delay of this advice as at their extreme peril; yet,\nas to myself, I should persist in it, till the result of the present\nconsultation with the militia officers, or till some new circumstance\nshould turn up, to explain the designs of the mutineers; and in\npursuing this line of conduct, I should counteract the sense of some\ngentlemen, whose feelings upon the occasion were keen, and the opinions\nof others, who thought the situation of Congress, under the existing\ncircumstances, extremely awkward, precarious, and unjustifiable to\ntheir constituents.\n\nYour Excellency approved my intention; wished for time; and promised,\nif any new resolution should be taken, to give me immediate notice of\nit.\n\nThe meeting of the militia officers dissolved. I heard nothing from\nyour Excellency. General St. Clair, about two in the afternoon,\ninformed the committee, that the officers appointed by the soldiers to\nmanage their business, had, in the first instance, refused to give him\nan account of their transactions; the which was only extracted from\nthem by a peremptory demand. He mentioned to us the instructions they\nhad received from the soldiers, which contained faint and affected\nconcessions, mixed with new and inadmissible claims.\n\nThe whole affair wore the complexion of collusion between the officers\nof the committee and the soldiery; and of a mere amusement on their\npart, till they could gain fresh strength and execute their project,\nwhatever it might be, with greater advantage.\n\nThis behavior of the officers gave the affair a new and more serious\naspect, and overcame my opposition to the report. Mr. Peters, on\nhearing the relation of General St. Clair, declared, at once, that he\nthought the committee had then no alternative; at least, what he said\nwas understood in this sense by General St. Clair, Mr. Ellsworth, and\nmyself. If I am not much mistaken, General St. Clair also expressed his\nopinion that Congress were unsafe in the city.\n\nThe ideas I suggested to your Excellency, in the conversation I have\nmentioned, were substantially expressed to several members of Congress\nas the motives of my delay; and particularly, I recollect, to Mr.\nMadison, with these observations in addition: That though I was fully\nconvinced Congress, under an immediate view of circumstances, would,\nin reality, be justified in withdrawing from a place where such an\noutrage to government had been with impunity perpetrated, by a body\nof armed mutineers, still, for several days, in complete command of\nthe city, and where either the feebleness of public councils, or the\nindisposition of the citizens, afforded no assurance of protection\nand support; yet, as the opinions of men would be governed by events,\nand as the most probable event was, that the removal of Congress,\nannouncing decisive measures of coercion to the soldiery, would awe\nthem into submission, there was great danger that the reputation of\nCongress would suffer by the easy termination of the business; and that\nthey would be accused of levity, timidity, or rashness.\n\nThough not within the scope of my original intention, I will indulge\na few additional reflections on this subject. I am sensible that the\nCouncil, in some respects, stand upon advantageous ground in this\ndiscussion. Congress left the city, because they had no forces at\nhand, no jurisdiction over the militia, and no assurances of effectual\nsupport from those who had. The Council, as the Executive of the\nState, were necessitated to remain on the spot. Soon after Congress\nremoved, the mutineers were deserted by their leaders, and surrendered\nat discretion.\n\nThe multitude will be very apt to conclude, that the affair was of\ntrifling consequence; that it vanished under its own insignificance;\nthat Congress took up the matter in too high a tone of authority; that\nthey discovered a prudish nicety and irritability about their own\ndignity: that Council were more temperate, more humane, and possessed\nof greater foresight.\n\nThe bias in favor of an injured army; the propensity of the human mind\nto lean to the speciousness of professed humanity, rather than to the\nnecessary harshness of authority; the vague and imperfect notions of\nwhat is due to public authority, in an infant popular government; and\nthe insinuating plausibility of a well-constructed _message_; will all\ncontribute to that conclusion.\n\nBut let us suppose an impartial man of sense, well acquainted with\nfacts, to form an argument upon the subject. It appears to me, he might\nnaturally fall into this train of combination.\n\nIt is a well known fact, that, from the necessities of the war, or\nthe delinquencies of the several States, Congress were not enabled to\ncomply with their engagements to the army, which, after a glorious\nand successful struggle for their country, much suffering, exemplary\npatience, and signal desert, they were compelled, by the irresistible\ndictates of an empty treasury and a ruined credit, to disband, after\nhaving given strong indications of their discontent, and resentment of\nthe public neglect. A large part of the army suffer themselves to be\npatiently dismissed; a particular corps of four or five hundred men,\nstationed in the place where Congress reside, refuse to accept their\ndischarges but on certain specified conditions.\n\nThey even go further, and, stimulated by their injuries, or encouraged\nand misled by designing persons, are emboldened to send a threatening\nmessage to Congress, declaring to them, that unless they would do them\njustice immediately, they would find means of redress for themselves.\nMeasures are indirectly taken to appease this disorder, and give the\ndiscontented soldiers as much satisfaction as the situation of things\nwill permit. Shortly after, accounts are received, that another corps,\nat â â miles distance, have also mutinied; and that a part of them, to\nthe number of about eighty men, are on their march to join those who\nhad already discovered so refractory a disposition. A committee of\nCongress is immediately appointed to confer with the Executive of\nthe State, on the measures proper to be pursued in this exigency.\nThat committee, in the first instance, suggest to the Council,\nthe expedience of calling out a body of militia, to intercept the\ndetachment of mutineers on its march, and represent the danger of\nthe progress of the spirit of mutiny, and of future outrages, should\nthose on their march be suffered, without molestation, to join a more\nnumerous corps in the same temper with themselves.\n\nThe Council urge a variety of difficulties: the shortness of the\ntime to collect the militia before the mutineers would arrive; the\nreluctance with which the citizens would obey a call against men whom\nthey consider as meritorious, and injured, and the like. The committee,\nperceiving the unwillingness of the Council to employ the militia,\ndesist from pressing, and recur to expedients. The day after, the\nmutineers march in triumph into the city, and unite themselves with\nthose who are already there; and the following day, the whole body\nassemble in arms, throw off all obedience to their officers, and, in\nopen defiance of government, march to the place which is the usual\nseat of Congress and the Council of the State, while both are actually\nsitting; surround it with guards, and send a message to the Council,\ndemanding authority to appoint, themselves, officers to command them,\nwith absolute discretion to take such measures as those officers should\nthink proper, to redress their grievances; accompanied with a threat,\nthat if there was not a compliance in twenty minutes, they would let in\nan injured soldiery upon them, and abide the consequence.\n\nThe members of Congress who were at the time assembled, request General\nSt. Clair, who happened to be present, to take such measures as he\nshould judge expedient, without committing the honor of government,\nto divert the storm, and induce the troops to return to their quarters\nwithout perpetrating acts of violence. General St. Clair, in concert\nwith the Council, grants the mutineers permission to elect, out of\nofficers then, or formerly, in commission, such as they should confide\nin, to represent their grievances to the Council, with a promise, that\nthe Council would confer with the persons elected for that purpose.\nHaving obtained this promise, the mutineers return to their quarters,\nin military parade, and continue in open defiance of government.\n\nThe concession made was a happy compromise between an attention to\ndignity, and a prudent regard to safety.\n\nMen who had dared to carry their insolence to such an extreme, and who\nsaw no opposition to their outrages, were not to be expected to retreat\nwithout an appearance, at least, of gratifying their demands. The\nslightest accident was sufficient to prompt men, in such a temper and\nsituation, to tragical excesses.\n\nBut however it might become the delicacy of government not to depart\nfrom the promise it had given, it was its duty to provide effectually\nagainst a repetition of such outrages; and to put itself in a situation\nto give, instead of receiving, the law; and to manifest that its\ncompliance was not the effect of necessity, but of choice.\n\nThis was not to be considered as the disorderly riot of an unarmed mob,\nbut as the deliberate mutiny of an incensed soldiery, carried to the\nutmost point of outrage short of assassination. The licentiousness of\nan army is to be dreaded in every government; but, in a republic, it\nis more particularly to be restrained; and when directed against the\ncivil authority, to be checked with energy, and punished with severity.\nThe merits and sufferings of the troops might be a proper motive for\nmitigating punishment, when it was in the power of the government\nto inflict it; but it was no reason for relaxing in the measures\nnecessary to put itself in that situation. Its authority was first to\nbe vindicated, and then its clemency to be displayed.\n\nThe rights of government are as essential to be defended, as the rights\nof individuals. The security of the one is inseparable from that of\nthe other. And, indeed, in every new government, especially of the\npopular kind, the great danger is, that public authority will not be\nsufficiently respected.\n\nBut upon this occasion, there were more particular reasons for decision.\n\nCongress knew there were, within two or three daysâ march of the city,\na more considerable body of the same corps, part of which had mutinied\nand come to town, and had been the chief actors in the late disorder;\nthat those men had, with difficulty, been kept, by the exertions of\ntheir officers, from joining the insurgents in the first instance; that\nthere was another corps in their neighborhood which, a little time\nbefore, had also discovered symptoms of mutiny; that a considerable\npart of the same line which were in mutiny in town, was every moment\nexpected to arrive from the southward, and, there was the greatest\nreason to conclude, would be infected with the same spirit, on their\narrival, as had presently happened in the case of a small detachment\nwhich had joined a few days before; that there were, besides, large\nnumbers of disbanded soldiers, scattered through the country, in want,\nand who had not yet had time to settle down to any occupation, and\nexchange their military for private habits; that some of these were\nreally coming in, and adding themselves to the revolters; that an\nextensive accession of strength might be gained from these different\nquarters; and that there were all the sympathies of like common wrongs,\ndistresses, and resentments, to bring them together, and to unite them\nin one cause. The partial success of those who had already made an\nexperiment, would be a strong encouragement to others; the rather, as\nthe whole line had formerly mutinied, not only with impunity, but with\nadvantage to themselves.\n\nIn this state of things, decision was most compatible with the safety\nof the community, as well as the dignity of government. Though no\ngeneral convulsion might be to be apprehended, serious mischiefs\nmight attend the progress of the disorder. Indeed, it would have been\nmeanness, to have negotiated and temporized with an armed banditti of\nfour or five hundred men; who, in any other situation than surrounding\na defenceless senate, could only become formidable by being feared.\nThis was not an insurrection of a whole people: it was not an army with\ntheir officers at their head, demanding the justice of their country;\neither of which might have made caution and concession respectable: it\nwas a handful of mutinous soldiers, who had equally violated the laws\nof discipline, as the rights of public authority.\n\nCongress, therefore, wisely resolve, that âit is necessary that\neffectual measures be immediately taken for supporting the public\nauthority;â and call upon the State in which they reside, for the\nassistance of its militia, at the same time that they send orders for\nthe march of a body of regular forces as an eventual resource.\n\nThere was a propriety in calling for the aid of the militia in the\nfirst place, for different reasons. Civil government may always, with\nmore peculiar propriety, resort to the aid of the citizens, to repel\nmilitary insults or encroachments.\n\nâTis there, it ought to be supposed, where it may seek its surest\ndependence, especially in a democracy, which is the creature of the\npeople. The citizens of each State are, in an aggregate light, the\ncitizens of the United States, and bound, as much to support the\nrepresentatives of the whole, as their own immediate representatives.\nThe insult was not to Congress personally; it was to the government,\nto public authority in general; and was very properly put upon that\nfooting. The regular forces, which Congress could command, were at a\ngreat distance, and could not, but in a length of time, be brought\nto effectuate their purpose. The disorder continued to exist on the\nspot where they were; was likely to increase by delay; and might be\nproductive of sudden and mischievous effects by being neglected.\n\nThe city and the Bank were in immediate danger of being rifled; and,\nperhaps, of suffering other calamities. The citizens, therefore, were\nthe proper persons to make the first exertion.\n\nThe objection, that these were not the objects of the care of Congress,\ncan only serve to mislead the vulgar. The peace and safety of the place\nwhich was the immediate residence of Congress, _endangered, too, by\nthe troops of the United States_, demanded their interposition. The\nPresident of the State of Pennsylvania was himself of this opinion;\nhaving declared to a member of that body, that as their troops were the\noffenders, it was proper for them to declare the necessity of calling\nout the militia, as a previous step to its being done.\n\nNor is there more weight in the supposition that the danger was\ninconsiderable; and that, from the pacific appearances of the troops,\nit was to be expected, the disorder would subside of itself. The facts\nwere, that the troops still continued in a state of mutiny; had made no\nsubmissions, nor offered any; and that they affected to negotiate with\ntheir arms in their hands.\n\nA band of mutinous soldiers, in such a situation, uncontrolled, and\nelated with their own power, was not to be trusted.\n\nThe most sudden vicissitudes and contradictory changes were to be\nexpected; and a fit of intoxication was sufficient, at any moment,\nwith men who had already gone such length, to make the city a scene of\nplunder and massacre. It was the height of rashness to leave the city\nexposed to the bare possibility of such mischiefs.\n\nThe only question, in this view, is, Whether there was greater\ndanger to the city, in attempting their reduction by force, than in\nendeavoring, by palliatives, to bring them to a sense of duty? It has\nbeen urged, and appeared to have operated strongly upon the minds of\nthe Council,[24] that the soldiers being already embodied, accustomed\nto arms, and ready to act at a momentâs warning, it would be extremely\nhazardous to attempt to collect the citizens to subdue them, as the\nmutineers might have taken advantage of the first confusion incident to\nthe measure, to do a great deal of mischief, before this militia could\nhave assembled in equal or superior force.\n\nIt is not to be denied, but that a small body of disciplined troops,\nheaded and led by their officers, with a plan of conduct, could have\neffected a great deal in similar circumstances; but it is equally\ncertain, that nothing can be more contemptible, than a body of men,\nused to be commanded and to obey, when deprived of the example and\ndirection of their officers. They are infinitely less to be dreaded\nthan an equal number of men who have never been broken to command, nor\nexchanged their natural courage for that artificial kind which is the\neffect of discipline and habit. Soldiers transfer their confidence from\nthemselves to their officers, face danger by the force of example,\nthe dread of punishment, and the sense of necessity. Take away these\ninducements and leave them to themselves, they are no longer resolute\nthan till they are opposed.\n\nIn the present case, it was to be relied upon, that the appearance of\nopposition would instantly bring the mutineers to a sense of their\ninsignificance, and to submission. Conscious of their weakness, from\nthe smallness of their numbers; in a populous city, and in the midst of\na populous country; awed by the consequences of resisting government\nby arms, and confounded by the want of proper leaders and proper\ndirection; the common soldiers would have thought of nothing but making\ntheir peace by the sacrifice of those who had been the authors of their\nmisconduct.\n\nThe idea, therefore, of coercion, was the safest and most prudent: for\nmore was to be apprehended from leaving them to their own passions,\nthan from attempting to control them by force. It will be seen, by and\nby, how far the events, justly appreciated, corresponded with this\nreasoning.\n\nCongress were not only right in adopting measures of coercion; but\nthey were also right in resolving to change their situation, if proper\nexertions were not made by the particular government and citizens of\nthe place where they resided. The want of such exertions would evince\nsome defect, no matter where, that would prove they ought to have no\nconfidence in their situation. They were, to all intents and purposes,\nin the power of a lawless, armed banditti, enraged, whether justly,\nor not, against them. However they might have had a right to expose\ntheir own persons to insult and outrage, they had no right to expose\nthe character of representatives, or the dignity of the States they\nrepresented, or of the Union. It was plain, they could not, with\npropriety, in such a state of things, proceed in their deliberations\nwhere they were; and it was right they should repair to a place where\nthey could do it. It was far from impossible, that the mutineers might\nhave been induced to seize their persons, as hostages for their own\nsecurity, as well as with a hope of extorting concessions. Had such\nan event taken place, the whole country would have exclaimed, Why did\nnot Congress withdraw from a place where they found they could not be\nassured of support; where the government was so feeble, or the citizens\nso indisposed, as to suffer three or four hundred mutinous soldiers\nto violate, with impunity, the authority of the United States, and of\ntheir own State?\n\nWhen they resolved to depart, on the want of adequate exertions, they\nhad reason to doubt their being made, from the disinclination shown by\nthe Council to call out the militia in the first instance: and when\nthey did actually depart, they were informed by the Council, that\nthe efforts of the citizens were not to be looked for, even from a\nrepetition of the outrage which had already happened; and it was to\nbe doubted what measure of outrage would produce them. They had also\nconvincing proof, that the mutiny was more serious than it had even at\nfirst appeared, by the participation of some of the officers.\n\nTo throw the blame of harshness and precipitancy upon Congress, it is\nsaid, that their dignity was only _accidentally_ and _undesignedly_\noffended. Much stress has been laid upon the message, from the\nsoldiery being directed to the Council, and not to them. All this,\nhowever, is very immaterial to the real merits of the question.\nWhatever might have been the first intention of the mutineers in this\nparticular act, whether it proceeded from artifice or confusion of\nideas, the indignity to Congress was the same. They knew that Congress\ncustomarily held their deliberations at the State House: and if it\neven be admitted, that they knew Saturday to be a day of usual recess,\nwhich, perhaps, is not altogether probable: when they came to the\nplace they saw, and knew, Congress to be assembled there. They did not\ndesist in consequence of this; but proceeded to station their guards,\nand execute their purposes. Members of Congress went out to them;\nremonstrated with them; represented the danger of their proceedings\nto themselves, and desired them to withdraw: but they persisted till\nthey obtained what they supposed a part of their object. A majority of\nthe same persons had, some days before, sent a message, almost equally\nexceptionable, to Congress; and at the time they scarcely spoke of any\nother body than Congress; who, indeed, may naturally be supposed to\nhave been the main object of their resentments: for Congress, having\nalways appeared to the soldiery, to be the body who contracted with\nthem, and who had broken faith with them, it is not to be supposed they\nwere capable of investigating the remote causes of the failures, so as\nto transfer the odium from Congress to the State.\n\nBut the substantial thing to be considered in this question, is the\nviolation of public authority. It cannot be disputed, that the mutiny\nof troops is a violation of that authority to which they owe obedience.\nThis was, in the present case, aggravated to a high degree of\natrociousness, by the gross insult to the government of Pennsylvania,\nin the face of Congress, and in defiance of their displeasure. It was\nfurther aggravated by continuing in that condition for a series of time.\n\nThe reasons have been assigned, that made it incumbent upon Congress\nto interpose; and when they called upon the State of Pennsylvania, not\nonly to vindicate its own rights, but to support their authority, the\ndeclining a compliance was a breach of the Confederation, and of the\nduty which the State of Pennsylvania owed to the United States. The\nbest apology for the government of Pennsylvania, in this case, is,\nthat they could not command the services of their citizens. But so\nimproper a disposition in the citizens, if admitted, must operate as an\nadditional justification to Congress, in their removal.\n\nThe subsequent events, justly appreciated, illustrate the propriety\nof their conduct. The mutineers did not make voluntary submissions\nin consequence of negotiation, persuasion, or conviction. They did\nnot submit till after Congress had left the city, publishing their\nintentions of coercion; till after there had been an _actual call_\nupon the militia; till their leaders and instigators, alarmed by the\napproach of force, and the fear of being betrayed by the men, fled.\nThey were reduced by coercion, not overcome by mildness. It appears,\ntoo, that while they were professing repentance, and a return to their\nduty, they were tampering with the troops at Yorktown and Lancaster,\nto increase their strength; and that two officers, at least, were\nconcerned in the mutiny, who, by their letters since, have confessed,\nthat some project of importance was in contemplation.\n\nThe call for the militia was made the day after it had been pronounced\nineligible by the Council. There could have been little change, in that\ntime, either in the temper or preparations of the citizens. The truth\nis, that the departure of Congress brought the matter to a crisis; and\nthat the Council were compelled, by necessity, to do what they ought to\nhave done before, through choice.\n\nIt is to be lamented they did not, by an earlier decision, prevent the\nnecessity of Congress taking a step which may have many disagreeable\nconsequences. They then would\n\n[_The residue of the manuscript is not found._]\n\n\n[20] These blanks are in the manuscript.\n\n[21] This blank is in the manuscript.\n\n[22] âThe words, as reported by the committee to Congress, were, âIt,â\ni.e., the arming of the citizens to suppress the mutineers, âwas not\nto be expected, merely from a repetition of the insult which had\nhappened.ââ--Note by Col.

As you were a witness to my conduct and opinions through\nthe whole of the transaction, I am induced to trouble you for your\ntestimony upon this occasion. I do not mean to make a public use of it;\nbut, through my friends, to vindicate myself from the imputations I\nhave mentioned.\n\nI will therefore request your answers to the following questions:\n\nDid that part of the resolutions, which related to the removal of\nCongress, originate with me, or not?\n\nDid I, as a member of the committee, appear to press the departure; or\ndid I not rather manifest a strong disposition to postpone that event\nas long as possible, even against the general current of opinion?\n\nI wish you to be as particular and full in your answer as your memory\nwill permit. I think you will recollect, that my idea was clearly\nthis: That the mutiny ought not to be terminated by negotiation; that\nCongress were justifiable in leaving a place where they did not receive\nthe support which they had a right to expect; but, as their removal\nwas a measure of a critical and delicate nature; might have an ill\nappearance in Europe; and might, from events, be susceptible of an\nunfavorable interpretation in this country; it was prudent to delay it\ntill its necessity became apparent: not only till it was manifest there\nwould be no change in the spirit which seemed to actuate the Council;\nbut till it was evident, complete submission was not to be expected\nfrom the troops; that, to give full time for this, it would be proper\nto delay the departure of Congress till the latest period which would\nbe compatible with the idea of meeting at Trenton or Princeton on\nThursday--perhaps even till Thursday morning.\n\n                                  I am, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n                                  A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo James Madison, Junior, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO JAMES MADISON, JR.\n\n\n                                    Philadelphia, July 6, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my arrival in this city I am more convinced than I was of the\nnecessity of giving a just state of facts to the public. The current\nruns strongly against Congress, and in a great measure for want of\ninformation. When facts are explained they make an impression, and\nincline to conclusions more favorable to us.\n\nI have no copy of the Reports in my possession, which puts it out of my\npower to publish them. Will you procure and send me one without loss of\ntime? Without appearing, I intend to give them to the public with some\nadditional explanations. This done with moderation will no doubt have a\ngood effect.\n\nThe prevailing idea is, that the actors in the removal of Congress\nwere influenced by the desire of getting them out of the city, and the\ngenerality of the remainder by timidity--some say passion. Few give a\nmore favorable interpretation.\n\nI will thank you in your letter to me to answer the following question:\n\nWhat appeared to be my ideas and disposition respecting the removal of\nCongress? Did I appear to wish to hasten it, or did I not rather show a\nstrong disposition to procrastinate it?\n\nI will be obliged to you in answering this question to do it fully. I\ndo not intend to make any public use of it, but through my friends to\nvindicate myself from the insinuation I have mentioned, and in that\nto confute the supposition that the motive assigned did actuate the\nmembers on whom it fell to be more particularly active.\n\n                                                   Yours,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MRS. HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   Philadelphia, July 22, 1783.\n\nI wrote you, my beloved Eliza, by the last post, which I hope will\nnot meet with the fate that many others of my letters must have met\nwith. I count upon setting out to see you in four days; but I have\nbeen so frequently disappointed by unforeseen events, that I shall\nnot be without apprehensions of being detained, till I have begun my\njourney. The members of Congress are very pressing with me not to go\naway at this time, as the House is thin, and as the definitive treaty\nis momently expected.\n\nTell your father that Mr. Rivington, in a letter to the South Carolina\ndelegates, has given information, coming to him from Admiral Arbuthnot,\nthat the Mercury frigate is arrived at New-York with the definitive\ntreaty, and that the city was to be evacuated yesterday, by the treaty.\n\nI am strongly urged to stay a few days for the ratification of the\ntreaty; at all events, however, I will not be long absent.\n\nI give you joy of the happy conclusion of this important work in which\nyour country has been engaged. Now, in a very short time, I hope we\nshall be happily settled in New-York.\n\nMy love to your father. Kiss my boy a thousand times.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\n\n\n                                      Princeton, July 27, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nA few days since I was honored with your Excellencyâs letter of the\nâ; and was glad to find your ideas on the subject\ncorresponded with mine.\n\nAs I shall, in a day or two, take leave of Congress, I think it my\nduty to give my opinion to the Legislature, on a matter of importance\nto the State, which has been long depending, and is still without a\nprospect of termination in the train in which it has been placed: I\nmean the affair of the Grants. It is hazardous to pass a positive\njudgment on what will happen in a body so mutable as that of Congress;\nbut from all I have seen, I have come to a settled opinion, that no\ndetermination will be taken and executed by them in any other manner,\nthan in that prescribed by the Confederation. There is always such\na diversity of views and interests; so many compromises to be made\nbetween different States; that, in a question of this nature, the\nembarrassments of which have been increased by the steps that have\npreceded, and in which the passions of the opposite sides have taken\na warm part, decision must be the result of necessity. While Congress\nhave a discretion, they will procrastinate: when they are bound by the\nConstitution, they must proceed.\n\nIt is, therefore, my opinion, that it will be advisable for the\nLegislature, when they meet, to review the question; and either to\nrelinquish their pretensions to the country in dispute, or to instruct\ntheir delegates, if a decision is not had within a limited time, to\ndeclare the submission to Congress revoked, and to institute a claim\naccording to the principles of the Confederation.\n\nIt would be out of my province to discuss which side of the alternative\nought, in policy, to prevail: but I will take the liberty to observe,\nthat if the last should be preferred, it would be expedient to remove\nevery motive of opposition from private claims; not only by confirming,\nin their full latitude, previous to the trial, the possessions of the\noriginal settlers, but even the grants of the usurped government. It\nmay happen, that it will be eventually necessary to employ force;\nand, in this case, it would be of great importance that neither the\ninhabitants of the Grants, nor powerful individuals in other States,\nshould find their private interest in contradiction to that of the\nState. This has already had great influence in counteracting our\nwishes; would continue to throw impediments in the way of ulterior\nmeasures; and might at last kindle a serious flame between the States.\n\nI communicated to your Excellency, in a former letter, that I had\ndeclined pressing the application of the Legislature to Congress,\nrespecting the State troops for garrisoning the frontier posts, because\ntemporary provision had been made in another way, which would save the\nState the immediate expense; and because there was a prospect of some\ngeneral provision for the defence of the frontiers on a Continental\nestablishment, which was to be preferred on every account. A report for\nthis purpose is now before Congress; but the thinness of representation\nhas, for some time, retarded, and still retards, its consideration.\n\nThe definitive treaty is not yet arrived; but from accounts which,\nthough not official, appear to deserve credit, it may be daily\nexpected. A gentleman, known and confided in, has arrived at\nPhiladelphia, who informs, that he saw a letter from Dr. Franklin to\nMr. Barkeley, telling him that the definitive treaties were signed the\ntwenty-seventh of May, between all the parties; that New-York was to be\nevacuated in six months from the ratification of the preliminaries in\nEurope, which will be the twelfth or fifteenth of next month.\n\nAs it is not my intention to return to Congress, I take this\nopportunity to make my respectful acknowledgments to the Legislature,\nfor the honorable mark of their confidence conferred upon me, by having\nchosen me to represent the State in that body. I shall be happy if my\nconduct has been agreeable to them.\n\n                                                 With perfect respect,\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\n                                                 Your Excellencyâs\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\nTo his Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nCLINTON TO DUANE AND LâHOMMEDIEU.\n\n\n                                                          Aug. 23, 1783.\n\n* * * * I would take this opportunity also of calling your attention to\nconcurrent resolutions of the Legislature, respecting the garrisoning\nof the Western posts in this State, which, by the provisional treaty,\nare to be evacuated by the British. These resolutions were in the tenor\nof instructions to our delegates, and were immediately transmitted to\nthem; but as I have not been favored with any official information of\nthe result, I submit it to you whether some report on a subject so\ninteresting to the State, may not be necessary for the satisfaction\nof the Legislature. From informal communications made to me by the\nCommander-in-Chief, I have reason to believe, that he has directions\nfrom Congress for garrisoning those posts with continental troops,\nand that he is making arrangements for that purpose. But as you will\nobserve, that as it was the sense of the Legislature, that those posts\nshould have been garrisoned by the State, an explanation on the subject\nbecomes the more necessary; and it is now for this reason alone, I\nwould request, that you would be pleased to favor me with a particular\ndetail of the motives which influenced the determination of Congress on\nthis occasion. For it will readily be perceived, that should Congress,\nat this late day, accede to the propositions made by the State, it\nmight be impracticable to carry them into execution, especially, as I\nhave not ventured, in the state of uncertainty in which I was left,\nto incur the expense which the necessary preparations for the purpose\nwould have required * * *\n\n                                                  Geo.

We can therefore, only refer His Excellency\nand the Legislature to you, our worthy colleagues, who, being fully\npossessed of the facts, can alone give the necessary official\ninformation.\n\n                  With sentiments of the most perfect esteem and regard,\n                  We have the honor to be,\n                  Gentlemen,\n                  Your most obedient servants,\n                  Jas.

I had heard of\nyour marriage, and it gave me pleasure, as well because it added to\nyour happiness, as because it tended to fix your residence in a State\nof which I long wished you to be and remain a citizen.\n\nThe character and talents of delegates to Congress daily become more\nand more important, and I regret your declining that appointment at\nthis interesting period. Respect, however, is due to the considerations\nwhich influence you, but as they do not oppose your accepting a place\nin the Legislature, I hope the State will still continue to draw\nadvantage from your services; much remains to be done, and laborers do\nnot abound.\n\nI am happy to hear that terms of peace, and the conduct of your\nnegotiators, give general satisfaction: but there are some of\nour countrymen, it seems, who are not content; and that, too,\nwith an article which I thought to be very unexceptionable; viz.,\nthe one ascertaining our boundaries. Perhaps those gentlemen are\nlatitudinarians.\n\nThe American newspapers, for some months past, contain advices which\ndo us harm. Violences and associations against the tories, pay an ill\ncompliment to government, and impeach our good faith in the opinion of\nsome, and our magnanimity in the opinion of many. Our reputation also\nsuffers, from the apparent reluctance to taxes, and the ease with which\nwe incur debts without providing for their payment. The complaints of\nthe army; the jealousies respecting Congress; the circumstances which\ninduced their leaving Philadelphia; and the too little appearance\nof a national spirit pervading, uniting, and invigorating the\nConfederacy, are considered as omens which portend the diminution of\nour respectability, power, and felicity.\n\nI hope that, as the wheel turns round, other and better indications\nwill soon appear. I am persuaded that America possesses too much wisdom\nand virtue, to permit her brilliant prospects to fade away for want of\neither.\n\nThe tories are almost as much pitied in these countries as they are\nexecrated in ours. An undue degree of severity towards them, would,\ntherefore, be impolitic, as well as unjustifiable. They who incline\nto involve that whole class of men in indiscriminate punishment and\nruin, certainly carry the matter too far. It would be an instance of\nunnecessary rigor, and unmanly revenge, without a parallel, except in\nthe annals of religious rage in times of bigotry and blindness. What\ndoes it signify where nine-tenths of these people are buried? I would\nrather see the sweat of their brows fertilize our fields than those of\nour neighbors. * * * * *\n\nVictory and Peace should, in my opinion, be followed by Clemency,\nModeration, and Benevolence: and we should be careful not to sully the\nglory of the Revolution, by licentiousness and cruelty. These are my\nsentiments: and however unpopular they may be, I have not the least\ndesire to conceal or disguise them.\n\n                                 Believe me to be,\n                                 With great regard and esteem, dear Sir,\n                                 Your most obedient humble servant,\n                                 John Jay.\n\n\nColonel A.

You are able to inform\nthem, if they wish information, in what degree I may have been useful:\nand I have entire confidence that you will do me justice.\n\nIn a letter which I wrote to you several months ago, I intimated\nthat it might be in your power to contribute to the establishment\nof our Federal Union upon a more solid basis. I have never since\nexplained myself. At the time, I was in hopes Congress might have\nbeen induced to take a decisive ground; to inform their constituents\nof the imperfections of the present system, and of the impossibility\nof conducting the public affairs, with honor to themselves and\nadvantage to the community, with powers so disproportioned to their\nresponsibility; and, having done this, in a full and forcible manner,\nto adjourn the moment the definitive treaty was ratified. In retiring\nat the same juncture, I wished you, in a solemn manner, to declare to\nthe people, your intended retreat from public concerns; your opinion of\nthe present government, and of the absolute necessity of a change.\n\nBefore I left Congress I despaired of the first; and your circular\nletter to the States had anticipated the last. I trust it will not be\nwithout effect; though I am persuaded it would have had more, combined\nwith what I have mentioned. At all events, without compliment, sir, it\nwill do you honor with the sensible and well meaning; and, ultimately,\nit is to be hoped, with the people at large, when the present epidemic\nfrenzy has subsided.\n\n                                                  I am, dear Sir,\n                                                  With sincere esteem,\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\n\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                    Albany, September 30, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nI think I may address the subject of this letter to your Excellency\nwith more propriety than to any other person, as it is purely of\na military nature; as you are best acquainted with my services as\nan officer; and as you are now engaged in assisting to form the\narrangements for the future peace establishment.\n\nYour Excellency knows, that in March, â82, I relinquished all claim to\nany future compensation for my services, either during the residue of\nthe war, or after its conclusion--simply retaining my rank. On this\nfoundation I build a hope, that I may be permitted to preserve my rank,\non the peace establishment, without emoluments and unattached to any\ncorps--as an honorary reward for the time I have devoted to the public.\nAs I may hereafter travel, I may find it an agreeable circumstance to\nappear in the character I have supported in the Revolution.\n\nI rest my claim solely on the sacrifice I have made; because I have\nno reason to believe that my services have appeared of any value to\nCongress; as they declined giving them any marks of their notice, on\nan occasion which appeared to my friends to entitle me to it, as well\nby the common practice of sovereigns, as by the particular practice of\nthis country in repeated instances.\n\nYour Excellency will recollect, that it was my lot at York Town to\ncommand, as senior officer, a successful attack upon one of the enemyâs\nredoubts; that the officer who acted in a similar capacity in another\nattack, made at the same time by the French troops, has been handsomely\ndistinguished, in consequence of it, by the government to which he\nbelongs; and that there are several examples among us, where Congress\nhave bestowed honors upon actions, perhaps not more useful nor,\napparently, more hazardous.\n\nThese observations are inapplicable to the present Congress, further\nthan as they may possibly furnish an additional motive to a compliance\nwith my wish.\n\nThe only thing I ask of your Excellency, is, that my application\nmay come into view in the course of the consultations on the peace\nestablishment.\n\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\n                                                 With sincere esteem,\n                                                 Your Excellencyâs\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\n\n\n                                       Albany, October 3, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nI have lately received from Messrs. Duane and LâHommedieu, an extract\nof a letter from your Excellency to the delegates, of the twenty-third\nof August last, requesting âa particular detail of the motives\nwhich influenced the determination of Congress,â respecting the\napplication of the Legislature to have their State troops released from\nContinental pay, for the purpose of garrisoning the frontier posts. In\nmy letters to your Excellency, of the first of June and twenty-seventh\nof July, which were intended to be official, I summarily informed you,\nthat Congress had made temporary provision for garrisoning the frontier\nposts, and that a plan was under deliberation relative to a peace\nestablishment, which would, of course, embrace that object permanently;\nthat such temporary provision being made at the common expense, and a\ngeneral plan being under consideration for the future, I had declined\npressing a compliance with the application of the Legislature;\nconceiving it to be more for the interest of the State, that the\nexpense should be jointly borne, than that it should fall exclusively\nupon itself.\n\nI did not enter into a more full detail upon the subject, because the\nbusiness continued, to the time I left Congress, in an undecided state;\nand it was impossible to judge what views would finally prevail.\n\nThe concurrent resolutions of the two Houses had been immediately, on\ntheir receipt, referred to a committee appointed to report on a peace\nestablishment, who had suspended their report on these resolutions,\ntill it should appear, what would be the fate of a general plan which\nhad been submitted.\n\nAs to the motives that influenced Congress in making the provision\nthey did make, rather than immediately assenting to the application\nof the State; as far as I was able to collect them, they were these:\nThe opinions of many were unsettled as to the most eligible mode of\nproviding for the security of the frontiers, consistent with the\nConstitution, as well with respect to the general policy of the Union,\nas to considerations of justice to those States whose frontiers were\nmore immediately exposed. A considerable part of the House appeared to\nthink, from reasons of a very cogent nature, that the well-being of the\nUnion required a federal provision for the security of the different\nparts; and that it would be a great hardship to individual States,\npeculiarly circumstanced, to throw the whole burthen of expense upon\nthem, by recurring to separate provisions, in a matter, the benefit of\nwhich would be immediately shared by their neighbors, and, ultimately,\nby the Union at large: that, indeed, it was not probable particular\nStates would be either able, or, _upon experiment_, willing, to make\ncompetent provision at their separate expense; and that the principle\nmight eventually excite jealousies between the States unfriendly to the\ncommon tranquillity.\n\nI freely confess I was one who held this opinion.\n\nQuestions naturally arose as to the true construction of the articles\nof Confederation upon this head; questions as delicate as interesting,\nand as difficult of solution.\n\nOn one hand, it was doubted whether Congress were authorized by the\nConfederation, to proceed upon the idea of a federal provision: on the\nother, it was perceived that such a contrary construction would be\ndangerous to the Union, including, among other inconveniences, this\nconsequence: That the United States, in Congress, cannot raise a single\nregiment, nor equip a single ship, for the general defence, till after\na declaration of war, or an actual commencement of hostilities.\n\nIn this dilemma, on an important constitutional question; other urgent\nmatters depending before Congress; and the advanced season requiring a\ndetermination upon the mode of securing the western posts in case of\na surrender this fall; all sides of the House concurred in making a\ntemporary provision, in the manner which has been communicated.\n\nMy apprehension of the views of the Legislature was simply this:\nThat, looking forward to a surrender of the posts, and conceiving,\nfrom some expressions in the articles of Confederation, that separate\nprovision was to be made for the frontier garrisons; they had thought\nit expedient to apply the troops already on foot to that purpose, and\nto propose to Congress to give their sanction to it.\n\nUnder this apprehension; reflecting, besides, that those troops were\nengaged only for a short period, upon a very improper establishment to\ncontinue, on account of the enormous pay to the private men; and that\nthe expense which is now shared by all, and which would have fallen\nsolely upon the State, had the application been complied with; would\nprobably be at the rate of nearly eighty thousand dollars per annum, a\nconsiderable sum for the State in its present situation; I acknowledge\nto your Excellency, that I saw with pleasure, rather than regret,\nthe turn which the affair took. I shall be sorry, however, if it has\ncontravened the intentions of the Legislature.\n\nI will take the liberty to add, upon this occasion, that it has always\nappeared to me of great importance, to this State in particular, as\nwell as to the Union in general, that Federal, rather than State,\nprovision should be made for the defence of every part of the\nConfederacy, in peace as well as in war.\n\nWithout entering into arguments of general policy, it will be\nsufficient to observe, that this State is, in all respects _critically\nsituated_.\n\nIts relative position, shape, and intersections, viewed on the map,\nstrongly speak this language.--Strengthen the Confederation; give it\nexclusively the power of the sword: let each State have no forces but\nits militia.\n\nAs a question of mere economy, the following considerations deserve\ngreat weight.\n\nThe North River facilitates attacks by sea and by land: and, besides\nthe frontier forts, all military men are of opinion, that a strong post\nshould be maintained at West Point, or some other position on the lower\npart of the river.\n\nIf Canada is well governed, it may become well peopled, and by\ninhabitants attached to its government. The British nation, while it\npreserves the idea of retaining possession of that country, may be\nexpected to keep on foot there, a large force. The position of that\nforce, either for defence or offence, will necessarily be such as will\nafford a prompt and easy access to us.\n\nOur precautions for defence, must be proportioned to their means of\nannoying us: and we may hereafter find it indispensable to increase our\nfrontier garrisons.\n\nThe present charge of a competent force in that quarter, thrown\nadditionally, into the scale of those contributions which we must make\nto the payment of the public debt, and to other objects of general\nexpense, if the Union lasts, would, I fear, enlarge our burthen beyond\nour ability: that charge, hereafter increased, as it may be, would be\noppressively felt by the people. It includes, not only the expense of\npaying and subsisting the necessary number of troops, but of keeping\nthe fortifications in repair; probably of creating others; and of\nfurnishing the requisite supplies of military stores. I say nothing\nof the Indian nations, because, though it will be always prudent to\nbe upon our guard against them, yet, I am of opinion we diminish the\nnecessity of it by making them our friends: and I take it for granted,\nthere cannot be a serious doubt, any where, as to the obvious policy of\nendeavoring to do it. Their friendship, alone, can keep our frontiers\nin peace. It is essential to the improvement of the fur trade; an\nobject of immense importance to the State. The attempt at the total\nexpulsion of so desultory a people, is as chimerical as it would be\npernicious. War with them is as expensive as it is destructive: it has\nnot a single object; for, the acquisitions of their lands is not to\nbe wished, till those now vacant are settled: and the surest, as well\nas the most just and humane way of removing them, is by extending our\nsettlements to their neighborhood.\n\nIndeed, it is not impossible they may be already willing to exchange\ntheir former possessions for others more remote.\n\nThe foregoing considerations would lose all force, if we had full\nsecurity that the rest of the world would make our safety and\nprosperity the first object of their reverence and care: but an\nexpectation of this kind would be too much against the ordinary course\nof human affairs; too visionary to be a rule for national conduct.\n\nIt is true, our situation secures us from conquest, if internal\ndissensions do not open the way: but when nations now make war upon\neach other, the object seldom is total conquest. Partial acquisitions;\nthe jealousy of power; the rivalship of dominion, or of commerce;\nsometimes national emulation and antipathy; are the motives.\n\nNothing shelters us from the operation of either of these causes.\nThe fisheries; the fur trade; the navigation of the lakes and of the\nMississippi; the western territory; the Islands of the West Indies,\nwith reference to traffic; in short, the passions of human nature,\nare abundant sources of contention and hostility. I will not trespass\nfurther on your Excellencyâs patience. I expected, indeed, that my last\nletter would have finished my official communications; but Messrs.\nDuane and LâHommedieu having transmitted the extract of your letter\nto Mr. Floyd and myself, in order that we might comply with what your\nExcellency thought would be expected by the Legislature, it became my\nduty to give this explanation. Mr. Floyd having been at Congress but a\nlittle time after the concurrent resolutions arrived, and being now at\na great distance from me, occasions a separate communication.\n\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\n                                                 With perfect respect,\n                                                 Your Excellencyâs\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\nN. B. I did not at the time inclose the resolution, directing the\nGeneral to provide for garrisoning the frontier posts, because I\nunderstood it would in course be transmitted to you by the President,\nor the Secretary at War.\n\n                                                                   A. H.\n\nTo his Excellency Governor Clinton.\n\n\n\n\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   Princeton, October 16, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor of the sixth of July, by some singular ill luck, never found\nits way to my hands till yesterday evening.\n\nThe only part that now needs attention, is a request that I would\nanswer the following question: âWhat appeared to be my ideas and\ndisposition respecting the removal of Congress: did I appear to wish\nto hasten it, or did I not rather show a strong disposition to\nprocrastinate it?â If this request had been received at the time it\nought, it might have been answered as fully as you then wished. Even\nafter the delay which has taken place, my recollection enables me, with\ncertainty, to witness, that the uniform strain of your sentiments, as\nthey appeared, both from particular conversations with myself, and\nincidental ones with others in my presence, was opposed to the removal\nof Congress, except in the last necessity; that when you finally\nyielded to the measure, it appeared to be more in compliance with the\nperemptory expostulations of others than with any disposition of your\nown mind; and that after the arrival of Congress at Princeton, your\nconversation showed that you reviewed the removal, rather with regret\nthan with pleasure.\n\nPerhaps this obedience to your wishes may be too late to answer the\noriginal object of them. But I could not omit such an opportunity of\ntestifying the esteem and regard with which I am\n\n                                                Your obedient servant,\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\n\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                  Rocky Hill, October 18, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am favored with your two letters of the thirtieth of September.\n\nThe debate on Indian affairs, which, I believe, is got through,\nand that on the residence of Congress, which is yet in agitation,\nhave entirely thrown aside, for some time, the consideration of the\npeace establishment. When it is resumed, I will take care that your\napplication comes into view; and shall be happy if any thing in my\npower may contribute to its success; being, with great truth,\n\n                                             Dear Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             G. Washington.\n\n\nTo Colonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nMcHENRY TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                   Princeton, October 22, 1783.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\nThe homilies you delivered in Congress are still recollected with\npleasure. The impressions they made are in favor of your integrity;\nand no one but believes you a man of honor and republican principles.\nWere you ten years older and twenty thousand pounds richer, there is\nno doubt but that you might obtain the suffrages of Congress for the\nhighest office in their gift. You are supposed to possess various\nknowledge, useful, substantial, and ornamental. Your very grave and\nyour cautious, your men who measure others by the standard of their\nown creeping politics, think you sometimes intemperate, but seldom\nvisionary: and that were you to pursue your object with as much cold\nperseverance as you do with ardor and argument, you would become\nirresistible. In a word, if you could submit to spend a whole life\nin dissecting a fly, you would be, in their opinion, one of the\ngreatest men in the world. Bold designs; measures calculated for their\nrapid execution; a wisdom that would convince from its own weight; a\nproject that would surprise the people into greater happiness, without\ngiving them an opportunity to view it and reject it; are not adapted\nto a council composed of discordant elements, or a people who have\nthirteen heads, each of which pay superstitious adorations to inferior\ndivinities.\n\nI have been deterred, from day to day, from sending you the extract you\ndesire, by a proclamation on the subject, which I expected would have\npassed. It is still _in dubio_. I have reported on Fleuryâs case, on\nthe principle you recommend. I fear his half-pay will not be granted.\n\nCongress, some time ago, determined to fix their Federal town on the\nDelaware, near Trenton. Yesterday they determined to erect a second\nFederal town on the Potomac, near Georgetown; and to reside equal\nperiods (not exceeding one year) at Annapolis and Trenton, till the\nbuildings are completed. We adjourn the twelfth of next month, to meet\nat Annapolis the twenty-sixth.\n\nAdieu, my dear friend; and in the days of your happiness drop a line to\nyours.\n\n                                                 James McHenry.\n\nP.S. Our exemplification of the Treaty has passed, and will be\ntransmitted to the State officially.\n\n                                                        J. McH.\n\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                  Rocky Hill, November 6, 1783.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe inclosed is a letter which I had written, and was about to dispatch\nat the date of it; but, upon second thoughts, determined to postpone\nit, and try, if, from the importance of the matter, I could not bring\nforward the peace establishment previously.\n\nI have tried in vain. Congress, after resolving, on the ---- of last\nmonth, to adjourn upon the twelfth of this, did, equally unexpectedly\nand surprisingly to me, finish their session at this place the day\nbefore yesterday; without bringing the peace establishment, or any of\nthe many other pressing matters, to a decision.\n\nFinding this was likely to be the case, I showed your letter to some\nof your particular friends; and consulted with them on the propriety\nof making known your wishes with my testimonial of your services to\nCongress; but they advised me to decline it, under a full persuasion\nthat no discrimination would, or indeed, could, be made at this late\nhour, as every other officer, from the highest to the lowest grades\n(not in actual command), were retiring without the retention of rank;\nand that the remainder, upon a peace establishment (if a Continental\none should ever take place), would come in upon the new system, under\nfresh appointments; so that unless you wished to come into actual\ncommand again (which none supposed), they saw no way by which you could\npreserve your rank.\n\nI have the pleasure to inclose you a brevet, giving you the rank of\nfull Colonel.\n\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\n                                             G. Washington.\n\nTo Colonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n\n                                    New-York, December 8, 1783.\n\nSir:\n\nBeing concerned as counsel for a number of persons who have been,\nsince the annunciation of the provisional treaty, indicted under the\nconfiscation laws of this State, for the part they are supposed to have\ntaken in the late war, we are induced, at the desire of our clients,\nand in their behalf, to apply to Congress, through your Excellency, for\nan exemplification of the definitive treaty. We take it for granted,\nthat ere this it will have been â â â â direction of the United States.\nWe have found a great strictness in the Courts in this State. It will,\nwe apprehend, be necessary to be able to produce an exemplification\nof the treaty under the seal of the United States. In a matter so\ninteresting to a great number of individuals, for it does not belong\nto us to urge considerations of national honor, we hope we shall be\nexcused when we observe, that there appears to be no probability that\nthe legislature of this State will interpose its authority to put\na stop to prosecutions, till the definitive treaty is announced in\nform. In the mean time, a period is limited for the appearance of the\nindicted persons to plead to their indictments, and if they neglect\nto appear, judgment by default will be entered against them. It is\ntherefore of great consequence to them, that we should have in our\npossession, as speedily as possible, an authentic document of the\ntreaty, and of its ratification by Congress; and we, on this account,\npray an exemplification of both.\n\nWe persuade ourselves that the justice and liberality of Congress will\ninduce a ready compliance with our prayer, which will conduce to the\nsecurity of a great number of individuals who derive their hopes of\nsafety from the national faith.\n\n                           We have the honor to be with perfect respect,\n                           Your Excellencyâs\n                           Most obedient and humble servants,\n                           A. Hamilton & others.\n\n  His Excellency\n  The President of Congress.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO J. B. CHURCH.\n\n\n                                      New-York, March 10, 1784.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nIn my last to you I informed you that a project for a land bank had\nbeen set on foot by Mr. Sayre, as the ostensible parent; but that I\nhad reason to suspect the Chancellor was the true father. The fact has\nturned out as I supposed, and the Chancellor, with a number of others,\nhave since petitioned the Legislature for an exclusive charter for the\nproposed bank. I thought it necessary, not only with a view to your\nproject, but for the sake of the commercial interests of the State, to\nstart an opposition to this scheme; and took occasion to point out its\nabsurdity and inconvenience to some of the most intelligent merchants,\nwho presently saw the matter in a proper light, and began to take\nmeasures to defeat the plan.\n\nThe Chancellor had taken so much pains with the country members,\nthat they all began to be persuaded that the land bank was the true\nPhilosopherâs stone that was to turn all their rocks and trees into\ngold; and there was great reason to apprehend a majority of the\nLegislature would have adopted his views. It became necessary to\nconvince the projectors themselves of the impracticability of their\nscheme; and to counteract the impressions they had made by a direct\napplication to the Legislature. Some of the merchants, to effect these\npurposes, set on foot a subscription for a money bank, and called upon\nme to subscribe. I was a little embarrassed how to act, but upon the\nwhole I concluded it best to fall in with them, and endeavor to induce\nthem to put the business upon such a footing as might enable you, with\nadvantage, to combine your interests with theirs; for since the thing\nhad been taken up upon the broad footing of the whole body of the\nmerchants, it appeared to me that it never would be your interest to\npursue a distinct project in opposition to theirs; but that you would\nprefer, so far as you might choose to employ money in this way, to\nbecome purchasers in the general bank. The object, on this supposition,\nwas to have the bank founded on such principles as would give you a\nproper weight in the direction. Unluckily, for this purpose, I entered\nrather late into the measure: proposals had been agreed upon, in which,\namong other things, it was settled that no stockholder, to whatever\namount, should have more than seven votes, which was the number to\nwhich a holder of ten shares was to be entitled. At an after meeting\nof some of the most influential characters, I engaged them so far to\ndepart from this ground, as to allow a vote for every five shares above\nten.\n\nThe stockholders have since thought proper to appoint me one of the\ndirectors. I shall hold it till Wadsworth and you come out, and, if you\nchoose to become parties to this bank, I shall make a vacancy for one\nof you. I inclose you the constitution, and the names of the President,\nDirectors, and Cashier.\n\nAn application for a charter has been made to the Legislature, with\na petition against granting an exclusive one to the land bank. The\nmeasures which have been taken appear to have had their effect upon the\nminds of the partisans of the land bank.\n\nThe affairs of the bank in Pennsylvania appear to be in some\nconfusion. They have stopped discounts; but I have no apprehension that\nthere is any thing more in the matter than temporary embarrassment from\nhaving a little overshot their mark in their issues of paper, and from\nthe opposition which the attempt to establish a new bank had produced.\n\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\nJ. B. Church, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO FITZSIMMONS.\n\n\n                                      New-York, March 21, 1784.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPermit me to introduce to your acquaintance and attention Mr.\nSeton, Cashier of the Bank of New-York. He is just setting out for\nPhiladelphia to procure materials and information in the forms of\nbusiness. I recommend him to you, because I am persuaded you will with\npleasure facilitate his object. Personally, I dare say you will be\npleased with him.\n\nHe will tell you of our embarrassments and prospects. I hope an\nincorporation of the two banks, which is evidently the interest of\nboth, has put an end to differences in Philadelphia. Here a wild and\nimpracticable scheme of a land bank stands in our way; the projectors\nof it persevering in spite of the experience they have, that all the\nmercantile and moneyed influence is against it.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWILLIAM SETON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                  Philadelphia, 27 March, 1784.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will observe by my letter of this day to our President, that I have\nbeen requested to postpone my visit to the bank until they shall be\nwell informed that the Bank of New-York has, or actually will, obtain\na charter. Although I am confident this is only an ostensible reason\nfor not wishing to see me at the bank, it will be highly necessary I\nshould be regularly informed of what is doing in this respect, that I\nmay be able to speak fully and with firmness to the subject; therefore,\nexclusive of any letter the director may write to me, I trust you will\ncommunicate to me whatever may appear to you essential for me to know.\n\nThe fact is (and which cannot be communicated to the many, and\ntherefore not mentioned in my official letter), their motive for not\nwishing to see me at the bank just now, arises from their being at\npresent in very great confusion--the opposition of the new bank began\nit, and being pressed so hard by this opposition, they were obliged\nto lay themselves so open, that it evidently appeared, if carried\nfurther, it would strike too fatal a blow. Therefore, for the safety\nof the community at large, it became absolutely necessary to drop the\nidea of a new bank, and to join hand in hand to relieve the old bank\nfrom the shock it had received. Gold and silver had been extracted in\nsuch amounts that discounting was stopped, and for this fortnight past\nnot any business has been done at the bank in this way. The distress\nit has occasioned to those dependent on circulation and engaged in\nlarge speculations, is severe; and, as if their cup of misery must\noverflow, by the last arrival from Europe, intelligence is received\nthat no less a sum than Â£60,000 sterling of Mr. Morrisâs bills, drawn\nfor the Dutch loan, are under protest. It is well known that the bank,\nby some means or other, must provide for this sum. The child must not\ndesert its parent in distress, and, such is their connection, that\nwhatever is fatal to the one must be so to the other. However, the man\nwho has more than once, by his consummate abilities, saved the American\nEmpire from ruin, will no doubt be found equal to overcome these\ntemporary inconveniences, and to restore universal confidence and good\norder. I trust you will be guarded in your conversation with others\non this subject, lest it might recoil on me, and not only place me in\na disagreeable situation, but defeat the purposes of my coming there.\nI have had several interviews with our friend Gov. Morris; he is for\nmaking the bank of New-York a branch of the bank of North America, but\nwe differ widely in our ideas of the benefit that would result from\nsuch a connection.\n\nIf it will not be intruding too much upon your time and goodness, may\nI request that you will now and then inform me what is doing by our\nLegislature, and permit me to assure you, that it will ever give me\nsingular pleasure to have it in my power to evince the respect and\nesteem with which\n\n                                       I am, dear Sir,\n                                       Your obât and very humble servât,\n                                       Wm. Seton.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\n\n\n                                       New-York, April 4, 1784.\n\nPardon me, my dear sir, for not sooner having obeyed your orders with\nrespect to the inclosed. I part with it reluctantly; for wit is so\nrare an article, that when we get so much of it in so small a compass,\nwe cannot easily consent to be dispossessed of it. I am very happy to\nhear of the union of your two Banks; for you will believe me when I\ntell you, that, on more deliberate consideration, I was led to view\nthe competition in a different light from that in which it at first\nstruck me. I had no doubt that it was against the interests of the\nproprietors; but, on a superficial view, I perceived benefits to the\ncommunity, which, on a more close inspection, I found were not real.\n\nYou will call our proceedings here _strange doings_. If some folks were\npaid to counteract the prosperity of the State, they could not take\nmore effectual measures than they do. But it is in vain to attempt to\nkick against the pricks.\n\nDiscrimination bills; partial taxes; schemes to engross public property\nin the hands of those who have present power; to banish the real\nwealth of the State, and to substitute paper bubbles; are the only\ndishes that suit the public palate at this time.\n\nPermit me to ask your opinion on a point of importance to the New-York\nBank--the best mode of receiving and paying out gold. I am aware of the\nevils of that which has been practised upon in Philadelphia--_weighing\nin quantities_; but I cannot satisfy myself about a substitute, unless\nthere could be a coinage.\n\nFavor me with your sentiments on this subject as soon as you can.\n\nBelieve me, with equal warmth and sincerity,\n\n                                                   Yours,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\nTo Gouverneur Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO DE CHASTELLUX.\n\n\n                                       New-York, June 14, 1784.\n\nMonsieur Le Chevalier:\n\nColonel Clarkeson, who will have the honor of delivering you this,\nbeing already known to you, I give him this letter more for the sake\nof renewing to you the assurances of my attachment and esteem, than\nfrom a supposition that he will stand in need of any new title to\nyour attention. I will therefore only say of him, that his excellent\nqualities cannot be known without interesting those to whom they are\nknown, and that from a personal and warm regard for him, I should be\nhappy, if any thing I could say, could be an additional motive for your\ncountenance and civilities to him.\n\nI speak of him in the light of a friend. As the messenger of Science,\nhe cannot fail to acquire the patronage of one of her favorite\nministers. He combines with the views of private satisfaction, which a\nvoyage to Europe cannot but afford, an undertaking for the benefit of\na Seminary of learning, lately instituted in this State. Learning is\nthe common concern of mankind; and why may not poor republicans, who\ncan do little more than wish her well, send abroad to solicit the favor\nof her patrons and friends? Her ambassador will tell you his errand.\nI leave it to your mistress to _command_ and to the trustees of the\ninstitution to _ask_ your interest in promoting his mission.\n\nPermit me only to add, that if there is any thing in this country by\nwhich I can contribute to your satisfaction, nothing will make me\nhappier at all times, than that your commands may enable me to give you\nproofs of the respectful and affectionate attachment with which\n\n                                       I have the honor to be,\n                                       Monsieur Le Chevalier,\n                                       Your most obât and humble servât,\n                                       A.

I have lived in the constant intention to answer it, and I\nnow execute my purpose. But why not sooner? âProcrastination is the\nthief of time,â says Dr. Young. I meant to have written fully on the\nsubject of the gold. But I waited some informations from Annapolis on\nthe probability of a Mint. I afterwards intended a long letter upon\na subject I mentioned to Mr. Seton, namely, a coalition between your\nBank and the National Bank. I do not find either party inclined to it.\nAnd yet both would be the better for it. You, I believe, will soon be\nout of blast unless it should take place. I could say a great deal\non this subject, but it would be very useless. When you find your\ncash diminish very fast, remind Seton of my predictions, and let him\ntell you what they were. If the Legislature should attempt to force\npaper money down your throats, it would be a good thing to be somewhat\nindependent of them. But I must check myself, or I shall go too far\ninto a business which would plague us both to no purpose. It shall be\nleft, therefore, until we meet.\n\n                                              Very affectionately yours,\n                                              Gouv. Morris.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                          Albany, Oct. 8, 1784.\n\nDear Hamilton:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral delays have retarded the opening of the Treaty; and when I\nwas upon the ground, it has been found that my influence with the\nIndians, both friendly and hostile tribes, was much greater than the\nCommissioners, and even myself, had conceived; so that I was requested,\neven by every one of the tribes there, to speak to those nations. There\nwere some, more or less, from each tribe. I stayed as long as the\nCommissioners thought I could do them some good; and that has rather\ncramped my private plans of visits.\n\nNow, my dear friend, I am going to Hartford, Boston, Newport; from\nthence, by water, to Virginia, in order to save time; and about the\ntwentieth of next month I hope to be again with you in New-York: but\nbefore that time will write you from Newport.\n\n                                         Adieu, my dear Hamilton.\n                                         Most affectionately I am yours,\n                                         La Fayette.\n\nP.S. I am told Mr. Jay is not determined upon accepting. I much wish he\nmay consent to it; the more so, as his probable successor does not hit\nmy fancy. Indeed, I very much wish Mr. Jay may accept the office.\n\nTo Colonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                         Boston, Oct. 22, 1784.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nEvery step I move, there comes upon me a happy necessity to change my\nplans. The reception I met with in Boston no words can describe; at\nleast it is impossible to express what I have felt. Gratitude as well\nas propriety conspired with all other inducements to keep me here some\ntime longer. Rhode Island and New Hampshire I must visit, and intend\nembarking by the first or second day of next month for Virginia, in\nthe Nymph frigate, which has been sent on my account. In less than\nfour weeksâ time from this day, I hope to be with Congress; and when\nmy business there is concluded, will come to New-York, where I hope we\nwill spend some days together. My stay in your city has been too short,\nfar inadequate to the feelings of my gratitude, and to the marks of\ngoodness bestowed upon me; but this time I will be some days longer\nwith my New-York friends.\n\nUpon reflecting on my situation, my circumstances, my love for America,\nand yet the motives that might render it improper for her to employ me\nin a public capacity, I have confined myself to a plan which, at the\nsame time that it gratifies my attachment and serves the United States,\ncannot have any shadow of inconvenience. After having told me they\nknow my zeal, I wish Congress to add, they want me to continue those\nfriendly, and, I might say, patriotic exertions; that in consequence\nof it, their ministers at home, and their ministers abroad, will have\na standing order to look to me as one whose information and exertions\nwill ever be employed to the service of the United States; and when\nthey think it is wanted, to communicate with me upon the affairs of\nAmerica; that Congress will, whenever I think it proper, be glad of my\ncorrespondence.\n\nUpon that general scale, every minister may conceal from me what he\npleases, may write to me only when he pleases; and should he ever think\nmy assistance is wanting, he has a title to ask, I have one to give\nit; and my connection with America is for ever kept, without giving\njealousy, upon such a footing as will remain at the disposition of each\npublic servant of Congress.\n\nIt seems to me, my dear friend, this idea already met with your\napprobation. In case it does, do promote it with your delegates and\nothers. If it does not, write it to me by the bearer whom I send by\nland to apologize to the General for my delays.\n\nOur friend Knox has been most affectionate and kind to me.\n\n                                                    Yours for ever,\n                                                    La Fayette.\n\nP.S. I have written to Wadsworth, and spoken to Bostonians respecting\nthe Baronâs affairs. I will do the same in Virginia, Maryland, and\nelsewhere.\n\nTo Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                         Paris, April 13, 1785.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nAlthough I have just now written to McHenry, requesting him to impart\nmy Gazette to you, a very barren one indeed, I feel within myself a\nwant to tell you, I love you tenderly. Your brother Church has sailed\nfor America, since which I had a letter from his lady, who is in very\ngood health. By an old letter from our friend Greene, I have been\ndelighted to find he consents to send his son to be educated with mine;\nthe idea makes me very happy. I wish, dear Hamilton, you would honor\nme with the same mark of your friendship and confidence. As there is\nno fear of a war, I intend visiting the Prussian and Austrian troops.\nIn one of your New-York Gazettes, I find an association against the\nslavery of negroes, which seems to me worded in such a way as to give\nno offence to the moderate men in the southern States. As I ever have\nbeen partial to my brethren of that color, I wish, if you are one in\nthe society, you would move, in your own name, for my being admitted on\nthe list. My best respects wait on Mrs. Hamilton. Adieu.\n\n                                               Your affectionate friend,\n                                               La Fayette.\n\n\n\n\nJOHN ADAMS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                       Grosvenor-Square, London, Oct. 19, 1785.\n\nSir:\n\nAt the instance of Mr. Hartley, in behalf of his friend, Mr. Francis\nUpton, I advised Mr. Upton to apply to some counsellor in New-York,\nand particularly to Mr. Hamilton, whose reputation was known to me,\nalthough his person was not.\n\nMr. Hartley now requests for Mr. Upton a letter of introduction. As a\ntotal stranger, but by character, it would be very difficult to find a\npretence to excuse the liberty I take in presenting Mr. Upton to you,\nand recommending his case to your attention. But, as we say at the bar,\nwhere I wish I was, _valeat quantum valere potest._ With much esteem,\n\n                             I have the honor to be, Sir,\n                             Your most obedient and most humble servant,\n                             John Adams.\n\nMr. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WILKES.\n\n\n                                                      November, 8, 1785.\n\nSir:\n\nThe message which you sent me yesterday, and your letter to-day,\nwere conceived in terms to which I am little accustomed. Were I to\nconsult my feelings only upon the occasion, I should return an\nanswer very different from that which I have, in justice to my own\nconduct, resolved upon. But in whatever light we are to view each\nother hereafter, and however harsh and indelicate I may think the\nmethod you have taken to obtain an explanation to be, I shall, for\nmy own part, leave no room to suppose that I intentionally gave you\nany cause to complain. I shall, therefore, explicitly declare, that\nwhatever inattention may have appeared towards you, was solely owing\nto the continual hurry in which my engagements, for a long time past,\nhave kept me; and that, so far from its having been occasioned by\nany designed neglect, it was what, under the circumstances, might\nhave happened to my best friend. Indeed, much of what you mention to\nhave been done by you, I am a stranger to. The frequent callings, by\nyourself and by your servant, did not, that I recollect, come to my\nknowledge. It is possible some of them might have been mentioned to\nme, and, in the hurry of my mind, forgotten. Once, I remember, I saw\nyour servant just as I was going out on some urgent business. I sent\na verbal message, promising that I would see you; which I intended\nto do, as soon as I had made up my resolution on the business of the\ninterview. When I received your note I was about sending you an answer\nin writing; but, upon inquiring for your servant, and finding him gone,\nI omitted it, with an intention to see you personally.\n\nYou say it is near six months since you first applied to me on the\nbusiness in question. A great part of the time I gave you all the\nanswer I could give you; to wit, that I had written to Mr. Macaulay,\nand only waited his answer. About two months since, I received it. I\nhave been the greater part of the time out of town on indispensable\nbusiness. In the intervals I have been occupied about objects of\nimmediate and absolute necessity, which could not have been delayed\nwithout letting my business run into utter confusion. Mr. Macaulayâs\nconcerns have been hanging upon my spirits. I have been promising\nmyself, from day to day, to bring them to a conclusion; but more\npressing objects have unavoidably postponed it. I thought the delay\nrequired some apology to Mr. Macaulay, but I never dreamt of having\ngiven occasion of offence to you.\n\nI will not, however, deny, upon a review of what has passed, that there\nhave been, through hurry and inadvertency on my part, appearances\nof neglect towards you; but between gentlemen and men of business,\nunfavorable conclusions ought not to be drawn before explanations are\nasked. Allowances ought to be made for the situations of parties; and\nthe omissions of men, deeply involved in business, ought rather to be\nascribed to that cause than to ill intentions.\n\nHad you, in the first instance, expressed to me (in such a manner\nas respect for yourself and delicacy to me dictated) your sense of\nthese appearances, I should have taken pains to satisfy you that\nnothing improper towards you was intended by me. But to make one of\nmy clerks the instrument of communication, and the bearer to me of a\nharsh accusation, was ill-judged and ungenteel. To take it for granted\nthat you had received an injury from me, without first giving me an\nopportunity of an explanation, and to couch your sense of it in terms\nso offensive as some of those used in your letter, is an additional\ninstance of precipitation and rudeness.\n\nInadvertencies susceptible of misapprehension, I may commit; but I\nam incapable of intending to wound or injure any man who has given\nme no cause for it; and I am incapable of doing any thing, sir, of\nwhich I need be ashamed. The intimation, on your part, is unmerited\nand unwarrantable. After thus having explained my own conduct to\nyou, and given you my ideas of yours, it will depend on yourself how\nfar I shall be indifferent, or not, to your future sentiments of my\ncharacter. I shall only add, that to-morrow you shall receive from me\nmy determination on the matter of business between us.\n\n                                      I am, with due consideration, Sir,\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\n                                      A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo John Wilkes, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nWILKES TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                       November 9, 1785.\n\nSir:\n\nThe moment I received yours, I perceived the precipitancy of my own\nconduct, and was very sorry I had so far mistaken both our characters\nto act in the manner I have done. I flatter myself, that the same\ncandor which has dictated yours, will be exerted towards mine, and\nthat you will only view it as the act of a man who conceived himself\ninjured. As you have never experienced the cruel reverses of fortune,\nyou can scarcely judge how the least insinuations to their prejudice\nwill affect those persons who have; or how much more suspicious they\nare of the behavior of mankind towards them.\n\nThe morning I left the message for you, I had been called upon by one\nof the creditors of Mr. Heart, who thought it very strange no dividend\nwas made; and he insinuated, some party must be interested in the\ndelay. It is the first money transaction I have engaged in since my\nrelease. I felt the insinuation as alluding to me, and with a force,\nwhich, perhaps, I should not. However, that moment I went to your\noffice.\n\nThe next morning, when I saw your note to Mr. Atkinson, and found\nmyself totally set aside in a business where I had, most undoubtedly,\nbeen originally neglected, I felt myself very much agitated; and in\nthat frame of mind I wrote my last to you.\n\nSo much I thought it necessary to add in explanation.\n\nI am convinced, now, I have been too hasty; and I am sorry for it. It\nwill put me on my guard in future, and I make no doubt prove beneficial\nto me, provided it has not been the means of hurting me in your\nestimation, which I am now more desirous than ever of obtaining.\n\n                                              I am, Sir, with respect,\n                                              Your much obliged,\n                                              And most obedient servant,\n                                              John Wilkes.\n\n\nTo Colonel Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                                      November 23, 1785.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMajor Fairly is just setting out on a visit to you, I believe on some\nbusiness relating to the Cincinnati. The society of this State met some\nshort time since, and took into consideration the proposed alterations\nin the original frame of the Institution: some were strenuous for\nadhering to the old Constitution, a few for adopting the new, and many\nfor a middle line. This disagreement of opinion, and the consideration\nthat the different State societies pursuing different courses--some\nadopting the alterations entire; others rejecting them in the same way;\nothers adopting in part and rejecting in part--might beget confusion\nand defeat good purposes, induced a proposal, which was unanimously\nagreed to, that a committee should be appointed to prepare and lay\nbefore the society, a circular letter, expressive of the sense of\nthe society on the different alterations proposed, and recommending\nthe giving powers to a general meeting of the Cincinnati, to make\nsuch alterations as might be thought advisable, to obviate objections\nand promote the interests of the society. I believe there will be no\ndifficulty in agreeing to change the present mode of continuing the\nsociety; but it appears to be the wish of our members, that some other\nmode may be defined and substituted, and that it might not be left to\nthe uncertainty of legislative provision. We object, too, to putting\nthe funds under legislative direction. Indeed, it appears to us, the\nLegislatures will not, at present, be inclined to give us any sanction.\n\nI am of the committee: and I cannot but flatter myself, that when the\nobject is better digested, and more fully explained, it will meet your\napprobation.\n\nThe poor _Baron_ is still soliciting Congress, and has every prospect\nof indigence before him. He has his imprudences; but, upon the whole,\nhe has rendered valuable services; and his merits and the reputation of\nthe country, alike, demand that he should not be left to suffer want.\n\nIf there could be any mode by which your influence could be employed in\nhis favor, by writing to your friends in Congress, or otherwise, the\nBaron and his friends would be under great obligations to you.\n\n                                            I have the honor to be,\n                                            With sincere esteem,\n                                            Your obât and humble servât,\n                                            Alex. Hamilton.\n\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Mount Vernon, December 11, 1785.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been favored with your letter of the twenty-third of November,\nby Major Fairly.\n\nSincerely do I wish that the several State societies had, or would\nadopt the alterations that were recommended by the general meeting, in\nMay, seventeen hundred and eighty-four. I then thought, and have had no\ncause since to change my opinion, that if the society of the Cincinnati\nmean to live in peace with the rest of their fellow-citizens, they must\nsubscribe to the alterations which were at that time adopted.\n\nThat the jealousies of, and prejudices against, this society, were\ncarried to an unwarrantable length, I will readily grant; and that\n_less_ than was done, _ought_ to have removed the fears which had been\nimbibed, I am as clear in, as I am that it would not have done it.\nBut it is a matter of little moment, whether the alarm which seized\nthe public mind was the result of foresight, envy, and jealousy, or\na disordered imagination: the effect of perseverance would have been\nthe same. Wherein, then, would have been found an equivalent for the\nseparation of interests which (from my best information, not from one\nState only, but many) would inevitably have taken place?\n\nThe fears of the people are not yet removed; they only sleep; and a\nvery little matter will set them afloat again. Had it not been for\nthe predicament we stood in with respect to the foreign officers and\nthe charitable part of the Institution, I should, on that occasion,\nas far as my voice would have gone, have endeavored to convince the\nnarrow-minded part of our countrymen, that the _amor patriÃ¦_ was much\nstronger in our breasts than theirs, and that our conduct, through\nthe whole of the business, was actuated by nobler and more generous\nsentiments than were apprehended, by abolishing the society at once,\nwith a declaration of the causes, and the purity of its intention. But\nthe latter may be interesting to many, and the former is an insuperable\nbar to such a step.\n\nI am sincerely concerned to find, by your letter, that the Baron is\nagain in straitened circumstances. I am much disinclined to ask favors\nof Congress; but if I knew what the object of his wishes are, I should\nhave much pleasure in rendering him any service in my power, with such\nmembers of that body as I now and then correspond with. I had flattered\nmyself, from what was told me some time ago, that Congress had made a\nfinal settlement with the Baron much to his satisfaction.\n\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\n                                      Your most obedient humble servant,\n                                      G. Washington.\n\nTo Alex. Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO NATHANIEL HAZARD.\n\n\n                                                         April 24, 1786.\n\nSir:\n\nYour letter of the twenty-first was only delivered me this morning. The\ngood opinion of liberal men I hold in too high estimation not to be\nflattered by that part of your letter which relates to me personally.\nThe other part I have communicated to General Schuyler, and he assures\nme he will see all his friends this afternoon upon the subject; so that\nI have no doubt, as far as his influence extends, it will be employed\nin favor of the success of the bill in the Assembly, as it has already\nbeen in the Senate.\n\nIn taking this step, however, I would not be understood to declare\nany opinion concerning the principles of the bill, with which I am\nnot sufficiently acquainted to form a decided opinion. I have merely\nmade your letter the occasion of introducing the subject to General\nSchuyler, whose sentiments are as favorable to your wishes as you could\ndesire.\n\nI make this observation from that spirit of candor which I hope will\nalways direct my conduct. I am aware that I have been represented as\nan enemy to the wishes of what you call your corps. If by this has\nbeen meant that I do not feel as much as any man, not immediately\ninterested, for the distresses of those merchants who have been in\na great measure the victims of the Revolution, the supposition does\nnot do justice either to my head or my heart. But if it means that I\nhave always viewed the mode of relieving them as a matter of peculiar\ndelicacy and difficulty, it is well founded.\n\nI should have thought it unnecessary to enter into this explanation,\nwere it not that I am held up as a candidate at the ensuing election;\nand I would not wish that the step I have taken, in respect to your\nletter, should be considered as implying more than it does; for I would\nnever wish to conciliate at the expense of candor. On the other hand,\nI confide in your liberality not to infer more than I intend from the\nexplanation I have given; and hope you will believe me to be, with\ngreat cordiality and esteem,\n\n                                                  Dear Sir,\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\n\n\nTo Mr. Hazard.\n\n\n\n\nCUSHING, DANA, AND BRECK TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      New-York, Sept. 10, 1786.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nUnderstanding, on our arrival in this city last Friday evening, that\nyou had gone on for the Convention at Annapolis the week past, we\ntake the liberty to acquaint you, and beg you to communicate to the\nConvention, if it should be opened before we arrive there, that we\nshall set off from this place to-morrow to join them, as Commissioners\nfrom the State of Massachusetts, which we hope to do in the course of\nthis week. The Commissioners from Philadelphia were to sail from thence\nfor this city, on the seventh instant, so that they may be expected\nsoon after us.\n\n                                     With great respect,\n                                     Your most obedient humble servants,\n                                     Thomas Cushing.\n                                     F. T. H. Dana.\n                                     Saml. Breck.\n\n  The Gentlemen\n  Commissioners for New-York.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                         Paris, April 12, 1787.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nIt is an age since I heard from you. Of you I hear by some of our\nfriends, and in the newspapers. But although I have a right to\ncomplain, I want to let you know the proceedings of our Assembly,\nwhich, as it is unusual in France, may raise your curiosity.\n\nOur Constitution is pretty much what it was in England before it had\nbeen fairly written down and minutely preserved; so that we have great\nclaims to freedom, to a National Representation, to the denial of\ntaxes, &c., &c. But disposition on one hand, and levity on the other\nhave manÅuvred us out of almost every privilege. They will still\nsubsist, however, more or less, in some provinces, and particularly in\nthose of Bretagne.\n\nNow that the follies of Courts had obliged Government to saddle us with\nnew taxes, and the opposition of our magistrates did present itself\nas an obstacle to the ministers, they have thought proper to call an\nAssembly of Notables, chosen by the king, but taken among the first\npeople in _each_ order, and to begin with granting them what is more\nwished for by the nation, an Assembly in each Province.\n\nThe last Assembly of Notables, in 1626, had been obedient to the\nministers. This one came at a more enlightened period. It happened\nunder a minister, who, although he has parts, is not equal to some of\nthe members--men of fine abilities. We are backed by the nation, and\nalthough not her representatives, have behaved as her interpreters, and\nwe have formed a great majority in favor of popular measures.\n\nThe speeches from the throne, those of M. de Calonne, have been\nprinted: the last one contains many falsehoods. The first measure\nwe took was for the clergy to declare they were ready to pay in the\nsame proportion with other people, for the Noblesse to make the same\ndeclaration, and reject a pecuniary privilege that was offered, in lieu\nof the other that is taken off.\n\nWe have gratefully accepted the provincial elective assemblies, but\nhave united on such alterations as will invigorate them. M. de Calonne\nhad made a mixture of democracy and despotism which did annihilate\nthose checks and gradations that are necessary evils, wherever there is\na king. But I think the provincial assemblies, as they are proposed by\nus, may lay a foundation for a good building.\n\nSeveral plans for the removal of internal Custom offices, for the\nfree exportation of corn, for the change in the salt tax, for the\nannihilation of some duties, and now for the disposal of the kingâs\ndomanial possessions, have been examined, and underwent several\nalterations. To some we have only left the titles of the chapters, but\nchanged them, in my opinion, much for the better.\n\nThe idea of a general tax in kind, was proposed by the government,\nbut we said it was not practicable. As to any new imposition, we have\nanswered, it is impossible to form an opinion before we know the return\nof the exports of the two last years, and the plans of economy that\nare intended. We have not, it is true, any powers from the nation,\nbut our opinion is asked, and in a measure has become necessary, and\na majority of us do not think their opinion can be given, until those\npreliminaries are fulfilled.\n\nThere is a very interesting contrast between the kingâs power at\nVersailles, and the opposition of that Assembly which is held there,\nand divided in seven committees of twenty, or twenty-two each, presided\nby a prince of the blood. Hitherto we have not voted in a General\nAssembly, although we had some to hear the Minister. But the opinions\nof the committees only are now taken, and in the end each vote will be\npronounced in the whole house, beginning from the last up to the first\nin rank. You know that we have the Clergy, Magistracy, Noblesse, and\nTiers Etat.\n\nAt the last meeting we had before the recess of these holidays, I had\na personal battle of some importance. The kingâs domanial property has\nbeen a pretence to lavish money on the princes of the blood, favorites,\nand the powerful people of the country. I had the day before moved for\nan examination of those bargains, wherein more than fifty millions have\nbeen thrown away. The great people being afraid of being found out,\nand particularly M. de Calonne, who is guilty of the most indecent\ndepredation, thought they must intimidate me and the Bishop of Langres,\nM. de la Luzerneâs brother, who had seconded my motion. They, in\nconsequence of it, persuaded the king to have us told by his brother,\nour president, that such motions ought to be signed. Upon which, we\nsigned the inclosed paper; and the bishop said, that after the rents,\nhe would bring in some accounts, signed by him, of the bargain of\nsinecure, made by M. de Calonne. The king was very angry with me; M.\nde Calonne, who had his confidence, intended signal revenge. I was\npreparing to support what I had said, when we suddenly heard that M. de\nCalonne had been dismissed. The keeper of the seal was also sent off.\nI am glad we got rid of M. de Calonne; and with his successor, who,\nunfortunately, is an old broken man, may improve the opportunity of\nthis Assembly, and let us make useful arrangements.\n\nAdieu, my dear Hamilton; my best respects wait on Mrs. Hamilton.\nRemember me to Gen. Knox, Wadsworth--all our friends, and particularly\nthe good doctor.\n\n                                              Most affectionately yours,\n                                              La Fayette.\n\nP. S. Donât tell the French ChargÃ© dâAffairs that you have this paper\nfrom me, except that there is nothing in it, for topics have spread\nevery _where_.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                        New-York, July 3, 1787.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn my passage through the Jerseys, and since my arrival here, I have\ntaken particular pains to discover the public sentiment, and I am\nmore and more convinced that this is the critical opportunity for\nestablishing the prosperity of this country on a solid foundation. I\nhave conversed with men of information, not only of this city, but from\ndifferent parts of the State; and they agree that there has been an\nastonishing revolution for the better in the minds of the people.\n\nThe prevailing apprehension among thinking men is, that the Convention,\nfrom the fear of shocking the popular opinion, will not go far enough.\nThey seem to be convinced, that a strong, well-mounted government will\nbetter suit the popular palate, than one of a different complexion.\nMen in office are, indeed, taking all possible pains to give an\nunfavorable impression of the Convention; but the current seems to be\nmoving strongly the other way.\n\nA plain, but sensible man, in a conversation I had with him yesterday,\nexpressed himself nearly in this manner:--The people begin to be\nconvinced that âtheir excellent form of government,â as they have been\nused to call it, will not answer their purpose, and that they must\nsubstitute something not very remote from that which they have lately\nquitted.\n\nThese appearances, though they will not warrant a conclusion that\nthe people are yet ripe for such a plan as I advocate, yet serve to\nprove that there is no reason to despair of their adopting one equally\nenergetic, if the Convention should think proper to propose it. They\nserve to prove that we ought not to allow too much weight to objections\ndrawn from the supposed repugnance of the people to an efficient\nconstitution. I confess, I am more and more inclined to believe, that\nformer habits of thinking are regaining their influence with more\nrapidity than is generally imagined.\n\nNot having compared ideas with you, sir, I cannot judge how far our\nsentiments agree; but, as I persuade myself, the genuineness of my\nrepresentations will receive credit with you. My anxiety for the\nevent of the deliberations of the Convention, induces me to make this\ncommunication of what appears to be the tendency of the public mind.\n\nI own to you, sir, that I am seriously and deeply distressed at the\naspect of the counsels which prevailed when I left Philadelphia. I fear\nthat we shall let slip the golden opportunity of rescuing the American\nEmpire from disunion, anarchy, and misery.\n\nNo motley or feeble measure can answer the end, or will finally receive\nthe public support. Decision is true wisdom, and will be not less\nreputable to the Convention, than salutary to the community.\n\nI shall of necessity remain here ten or twelve days. If I have reason\nto believe that my attendance at Philadelphia will not be mere waste of\ntime, I shall, after that period, rejoin the Convention.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                 Philadelphia, 10th July, 1787.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI thank you for your communication of the 3d. When I refer you to the\nstate of the councils which prevailed at the period you left this city,\nand add that they are now, if possible, in a worse train than ever; you\nwill find but little ground on which the hope of a good establishment\ncan be formed. In a word, I _almost_ despair of seeing a favorable\nissue to the proceedings of the Convention, and do, therefore, repent\nhaving any agency in the business.\n\nThe men who oppose a strong and energetic government are in my opinion\nnarrow-minded politicians, or are under the influence of local views.\nThe apprehension expressed by them, that the _people_ will not accede\nto the form proposed, is the _ostensible_, not the _real_, cause of\nthe opposition; but admitting that the _present_ sentiment is as they\nprognosticate, the question ought nevertheless to be, is it or is it\nnot the best form? If the former, recommend it, and it will assuredly\nobtain, maugre opposition.\n\nI am sorry you went away; I wish you were back. The crisis is equally\nimportant and alarming, and no opposition under such circumstances\nshould discourage exertions, till the signature is fixed. I will not at\nthis time trouble you with more than my best wishes and sincere regards.\n\n                                                 I am, dear Sir,\n                                                 Your obedient servant,\n                                                 G. Washington.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO ----\n\n\n                                          New-York, ----, 1787.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAgreeably to what passed between us, I have had an interview with Mr.\nAuldjo, and I flatter myself if there is (as I doubt not there will\nbe) as much moderation on the part of Major Peirce as there appears\nto be on that of Mr. Auldjo, that the affair between them may yet be\namicably terminated.\n\nBut Mr. Auldjo observes, I confess in my opinion with propriety, that\nhe ought to know with some precision the matters which have given\noffence to Major Peirce, before he can enter into explanations; which\nhe declares himself to be very ready to do with coolness and candor,\nthe moment he shall be enabled to do it by a specification of the\nsubjects of complaint. If a personal interview is for any reason\ndisagreeable to Major Peirce, I entreat you, my dear sir, to obtain\nfrom him, and to communicate to me by letter, the substance of what has\noccasioned his dissatisfaction, with so much particularity only as will\nput it in the power of Mr. Auldjo to give an explicit answer. Major\nPeirce will, I hope, have no scruples about this, for as the door of\nexplanation has been opened by Mr. Auldjo, there is no punctilio which\nstands in his way; and I trust he will feel the force of a sentiment\nwhich prudence and humanity equally dictate, that extremities ought\nthen only to ensue when, after a fair experiment, accommodation has\nbeen found impracticable. An attention to this principle interests the\ncharacters of both the gentlemen concerned, and with them our own; and\nfrom every other consideration, as well as that of personal friendship\nto the parties, I sincerely wish to give it its full operation. I am\nconvinced you are not less anxious to effect this than myself; and I\ntrust our joint endeavors will not prove unsuccessful.\n\n                                        I remain with sincere regard,\n                                        Dear Sir, your obedient servant,\n                                        Alex. Hamilton.\n\nI cannot, however, conclude without making one remark. Though Mr.\nAuldjo has expressed and still entertains a desire of explanation,\nit would ill become him to solicit it. Whatever, therefore, in my\nexpressions may seem to urge such an explanation with the earnestness\nof entreaty, must be ascribed to my own feelings, and to that\ninclination which every man of sensibility must feel, not to see\nextremities take place if it be in his power to prevent them, or until\nthey become an absolutely necessary sacrifice to public opinion.\n\n                                        I remain with sincere regard,\n                                        Dear Sir, your obedient servant,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO AULDJO.\n\n\n                                       New-York, July 26, 1787.\n\nSir:\n\nI have delivered the paper you committed to me, as it stood altered, to\nMajor Peirce, from whose conduct I am to conclude the affair between\nyou is at an end. He informs me that he is shortly to set out on a\njaunt up the North River.\n\nAs you intimate a wish to have my sentiments in writing on the\ntransaction, I shall with pleasure declare that the steps you have\ntaken in consequence of Mr. Peirceâs challenge have been altogether\nin conformity to my opinion of what would be prudent, proper, and\nhonorable on your part. They seem to have satisfied Mr. Peirceâs\nscruples arising from what he apprehended in some particulars to have\nbeen your conduct to him, and I presume we are to hear nothing further\nof the matter.\n\n                                       I remain with great esteem, Sir,\n                                       Your obedient and humble servant,\n                                       Alex. Hamilton.\n\nTo Mr. Auldjo.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO RUFUS KING.\n\n\n                                     New-York, August 20, 1787.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince my arrival here, I have written to my colleagues, informing\nthem if either of them would come down, I would accompany him to\nPhiladelphia; so much for the sake of propriety and public opinion.\nIn the mean time, if any material alteration should happen to be made\nin the plan now before the Convention, I will be obliged to you for a\ncommunication of it. I will also be obliged to you to let me know when\nyour conclusion is at hand, for I would choose to be present at that\ntime.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WADSWORTH.\n\n\n                                                        August 20, 1787.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nThe inclosed is said to be the copy of a letter circulating in your\nState. The history of its appearance among us is, that it was sent\nby one _Whitmore_ of Stratford, formerly in the Paymaster Generalâs\noffice, to one James Reynolds of this city.\n\nI am at a loss clearly to understand its object, and have some\nsuspicion, that it has been fabricated to excite jealousy against the\nConvention, with a view to an opposition to their recommendations. At\nall events, I wish, if possible, to trace its source, and send it to\nyou for that purpose.\n\nWhitmore must of course say where he got it, and by pursuing the\ninformation we may at last come at the author. Let me know the\npolitical connections of this man, and the complexion of the people\nmost active in the circulation of the letter. Be so good as to attend\nto this inquiry somewhat particularly, as I have different reasons of\nsome moment for setting it on foot.\n\n                                                   I remain, &c.\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\nTo Jeremiah Wadsworth.\n\n\n\n\nCOL. WADSWORTH TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                     Hartford, August 26, 1787.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI received your favor this day, with the inclosed copy of a letter,\nsaid to be circulating in this State. Some time since a paragraph\nin the New Haven papers hinted at such a letter, and appeared to be\nwritten to secure the Anti-federal party or alarm them. And I believed\nit was well intended, as it seemed to be meant to prepare them to\ncomply with the doings of the Convention, lest worse befell them; but\nthe close of the letter appears to be calculated for other purposes.\nWetmore has always associated with men who wished well to America, and\na good Government. He is half-brother to the spirited Federal writer\nin our papers, who signs himself Cato; and if he has really written\nor circulated the letter in question, I am quite at a loss to know\nhis intentions. I have communicated this matter to Col. Humphreys, in\nconfidence, who is on his way to New Haven, where Wetmore lives, though\nformerly of Hartford. He will inquire carefully into the matter, and\nwrite you. He has lived in the same town with Wetmore, and can easily\nfathom him. Wetmore is naturally sanguine, has some talents, and I\nbelieve, is enterprising, but fickle. Who the active people in this\nbusiness are, I have yet to learn, as it certainly has not circulated\nhereabouts. But from Humphreys you may expect to know all that is\ntrue, in Wetmoreâs neighborhood. I have always been Humphreysâ friend,\nbut a nearer acquaintance with him convinces me he is a man of great\nintegrity, and such talents as would wear well in any employment of\nconfidence. If he comes to New-York I wish you to be more acquainted\nwith him.\n\n                                               I am, dear Sir,\n                                               Your very humble servant,\n                                               Jerh. Wadsworth.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO RUFUS KING.\n\n\n                                     New-York, August 28, 1787.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wrote you, some days since, to request you to inform me when there\nwas a prospect of your finishing, as I intended to be with you, for\ncertain reasons, before the conclusion. It is whispered here, that some\nlate changes in your scheme have taken place, which give it a higher\ntone. Is this the case? I leave town to-day to attend a circuit in a\nneighboring county, from which I shall return the last of the week, and\nshall be glad to find a line from you, explanatory of the period of the\nprobable termination of your business.\n\n\n\n\nCOLONEL HUMPHREYS TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                     New Haven, Sept. 16, 1787.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nOur friend Col. Wadsworth has communicated to me a letter, in which\nyou made inquiries respecting a political letter that has lately\ncirculated in this State. I arrived in this town yesterday, and have\nsince conversed with several intelligent persons on the subject. It\nappears to have been printed in a Fairfield paper as long ago as the\n25th of July. I have not been able to trace it to its source. Mr.\nWetmore informs me, that when he first saw this letter it was in the\nhands of one Jared Mansfield, who, I believe, has formerly been reputed\na Loyalist. Indeed it seems to have been received and circulated with\navidity by that class of people, whether it was fabricated by them or\nnot. I think, however, there is little doubt that it was manufactured\nin this State. I demanded of Mr. Wetmore what he thought were the\nwishes and objects of the writer of that letter. He said, he believed\nit might be written principally for the amusement of the author, and\nperhaps with some view to learn whether the people were not absolutely\nindifferent to all government and dead to all political sentiment.\n\nBefore I saw the letter in question, a paragraph had been published\nby Mr. Meigs, giving an account of it, and attempting to excite the\napprehensions of the Anti-federalists, with an idea, that the most\ndisastrous consequences are to be expected, unless we shall accept the\nproceedings of the Convention. Some think this was the real design of\nthe fictitious performance, but others, with more reason, that it was\nintended to feel the public pulse, and to discover whether the public\nmind would be startled with propositions of Royalty. The quondam tories\nhave undoubtedly conceived hopes of a future union with Great Britain,\nfrom the inefficacy of our Government, and the tumults which prevailed\nin Massachusetts during the last winter. I saw a letter, written at\nthat period, by a Clergyman of considerable reputation in Nova Scotia,\nto a person of eminence in this State, stating the impossibility of our\nbeing happy under our present Constitution, and proposing (now we could\nthink and argue calmly on all the consequences) that the efforts of the\nmoderate, the virtuous, and the brave, should be exerted to effect a\nreunion with the parent State. He mentioned, among other things, how\ninstrumental the Cincinnati might be, and how much it would redound to\ntheir emolument. It seems, by a conversation I have had here, that the\nultimate practicability of introducing the Bishop of Osnaburgh is not a\nnovel idea among those who were formerly termed Loyalists. Ever since\nthe peace it has been occasionally talked of and wished for. Yesterday,\nwhere I dined, half jest--half earnest--he was given as the first toast.\n\nI leave you now, my dear friend, to reflect how ripe we are for the\nmost mad and ruinous project that can be suggested, especially when,\nin addition to this view, we take into consideration how thoroughly\nthe patriotic part of the community--the friends of an efficient\nGovernment, are discouraged with the present system, and irritated at\nthe popular demagogues who are determined to keep themselves in office,\nat the risk of every thing. Thence apprehensions are formed, that\nthough the measures proposed by the Convention, may not be equal to the\nwishes of the most enlightened and virtuous, yet that they will be too\nhigh-toned to be adopted by our popular assemblies. Should that happen,\nour political ship will be left afloat on a sea of chance, without a\nrudder as well as without a pilot.\n\nI am happy to see you have (some of you) had the honest boldness\nto attack in a public paper, the Anti-federal dogmas of a great\npersonage in your State. Go on and prosper. Were the men of talents\nand honesty, throughout the Continent, properly combined into one\nphalanx, I am confident they would be competent to hew their way\nthrough all opposition. Were there no little jealousies, bickerings\nand unworthy sinister views, to divert them from their object, they\nmight by perseverance, establish a Government calculated to promote the\nhappiness of mankind, and to make the Revolution a blessing instead of\na curse.\n\nI think it is probable that I shall soon go to the southward; in the\nmean time, I beg you to be persuaded that I am, with sentiments of\nsincere friendship and esteem,\n\n                              My dear Hamilton,\n                              Your most obedient and most humble servât,\n                              D. Humphreys.\n\nCol. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                                                   1787.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou probably saw, some time since, some animadversions on certain\nexpressions of Governor Clinton, respecting the Convention. You may\nhave seen a piece, signed âA Republican,â attempting to bring the fact\ninto question, and endeavoring to controvert the conclusions drawn from\nit, if true. My answer you will find in the inclosed. I trouble you\nwith it merely from that anxiety, which is natural to every man, to\nhave his veracity at least stand in a fair light. The matter seems to\nbe given up by the Governor, and the fact, with the inferences from it,\nstand against him in full force, and operate as they ought to do.\n\nIt is, however, of some importance to the party to diminish whatever\ncredit or influence I may possess, and to effect this, they stick at\nnothing. Among many contemptible artifices practised by them, they\nhave had recourse to an insinuation, that I _palmed_ myself upon you,\nand that you _dismissed_ me from your family. This I confess hurts my\nfeelings, and if it obtains credit, will require a contradiction. You,\nsir, will undoubtedly recollect the manner in which I came into your\nfamily, and went out of it; and know how destitute of foundation such\ninsinuations are. My confidence in your justice will not permit me to\ndoubt your readiness to put the matter in its true light in your answer\nto this letter. It cannot be my wish to give any complexion to the\naffair which might excite the least scruple in you; but I confess it\nwould mortify me to lie under the imputation, either of having obtruded\nmyself into the family of a General, or of having been turned out of it.\n\nThe new Constitution is as popular in this city as it is possible\nfor any thing to be, and the prospect thus far is favorable to it\nthroughout the State. But there is no saying what turn things may take\nwhen the full flood of official influence is let loose against it. This\nis to be expected; for though the Governor has not publicly declared\nhimself, his particular connections and confidential friends are loud\nagainst it.\n\nMrs. Hamilton joins in respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington.\n\n                                     I remain with perfect esteem,\n                                     Your Excellencyâs obedient servant,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Paris, October 15, 1787.\n\nMy Dear Hamilton:\n\nWhile you have been attending your most important Convention, debates\nwere also going on in France respecting the constitutional rights, and\nmatters of that kind. Grave reforms are taking place at court. The\nparliaments are remonstrating, and our provincial assemblies begin to\npop out. Amidst many things that were not much to the purpose, some\ngood principles have been laid out; and, although our affairs have\na proper arrangement, the nation will not in the last be the loser.\nThe prime minister is a man of candor, honesty, and abilities. But\nnow the rumor of war sets us a-going. Not that France is wishing for\nit, and Great Britain ought to be satisfied with an advantageous\ntreaty of commerce, and the profit of hers and Prussiaâs treachery in\nHolland. But, while I consider the madness of the Turks, the movements\nof the Imperial Court, the folly of his Prussian Majesty, the late\ncatastrophe in Holland, and the cry of England for war, I hardly think\nthat the peaceful dispositions of this ministry--and, they say, of\nMr. Pitt--will be able to extinguish a fire that is catching in every\ncorner of Europe. It would be consistent with my inclination and best\nviews that America be engaged in an active co-operation. But as I do\nnot think it consistent with her interest, I have taken the liberty\nto express my ideas in an official letter to Mr. Jay, to whom I refer\nyou. It seems to me, that a friendly, helping neutrality, would be\nuseful to France, profitable to the United States, and perfectly safe\non the footing of the treaties. Should America be forced to war, I wish\nit would be for the last campaign--time enough to occupy Canada and\nNewfoundland. But I see no inconvenience in privateering with French\nletters of marque.\n\nInclosed is the journal of a preliminary assembly in Auvergne. I am\nreturning there as soon as we have done some arrangements respecting\nAmerican commerce, which will result on as good footing in this kingdom\nas it is for the moment possible. The ministry are more favorably\ndisposed.\n\nI hope you will be satisfied with Count de Maurice and the Countess\nde Brehan, his sister-in-law. I beg leave to introduce them both to\nyou and Mrs. Hamilton, to whom I offer my most affectionate regards.\nRemember me to the rest of the family and all friends. My best\ncompliments wait on Gen. Schuyler and the doctor. Adieu, my good\nfriend. The post is going to town. I have only time to tell that I am\never\n\n                                          Your most affectionate friend,\n                                          La Fayette.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                Mount Vernon, October 18, 1787.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor, without date, came to my hand by the last post. It is\nwith unfeigned concern I perceive that a political dispute has arisen\nbetween Gov. Clinton and yourself. For both of you I have the highest\nesteem and regard. But as you say it is insinuated by some of your\npolitical adversaries, and may obtain credit, âthat you _palmed_\nyourself upon me and was _dismissed_ from my family,â and call upon\nme to do you justice by a recital of the facts; I do, therefore,\nexplicitly declare, that both charges are entirely unfounded. With\nrespect to the first, I have no cause to believe that you took a\nsingle step to accomplish, or had the most distant idea of receiving\nan appointment in my family till you were invited thereto. And with\nrespect to the second, that your quitting it was altogether the effect\nof your own choice.\n\nWhen the situation of this country calls loudly for unanimity and\nvigor, it is to be lamented that gentlemen of talent and character\nshould disagree in their sentiments for promoting the public weal; but\nunfortunately this ever has been, and more than probable ever will be,\nthe case in the affairs of man.\n\nHaving scarcely been from home since my return from Philadelphia, I can\ngive but little information with respect to the _general_ reception of\nthe new constitution in _this_ State. In Alexandria, however, and some\nof the adjacent counties, it has been embraced with an enthusiastic\nwarmth of which I had no conception. I expect, notwithstanding, violent\nopposition will be given to it by _some_ characters of weight and\ninfluence in the State.\n\nMrs. Washington unites with me in sending her best wishes for Mrs.\nHamilton and yourself.\n\n                             I am, dear Sir,\n                             Your most obedient and affectionate friend,\n                             G. Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                                       October 30, 1787.\n\nI am much obliged to your Excellency for the explicit manner in which\nyou contradict the insinuations mentioned in my last letter. The only\nuse I shall make of your answer will be to put it into the hands of a\nfew friends.\n\nThe constitution proposed has in this State warm friends, and warm\nenemies. The first impressions every where are in its favor; but the\nartillery of its opponents makes some impression. The event cannot yet\nbe foreseen. The inclosed is the first number of a series of papers to\nbe written in its defence.\n\nI send you also, at the request of the Baron De Steuben, a printed\npamphlet, containing the grounds of an application lately made to\nCongress. He tells me there is some reference to you, the object of\nwhich he does not himself seem clearly to understand; but imagines it\nmay be in your power to be of service to him.\n\nThere are public considerations that induce me to be somewhat anxious\nfor his success. He is fortified with materials, which, in Europe,\ncould not fail to establish the belief of the contract he alleges. The\ndocuments of service he possesses are of a nature to convey an exalted\nidea of them. The compensations he has received, though considerable,\nif compared with those which have been received by American officers,\nwill, according to European ideas, be very scanty in application to\na stranger who is acknowledged to have rendered essential services.\nOur reputation abroad is not at present too high. To dismiss an old\nsoldier empty and hungry, to seek the bounty of those on whom he has\nno claims, and to complain of unkind returns and violated engagements,\nwill certainly not tend to raise it. I confess, too, there is something\nin my feelings which would incline me in this case to go farther than\nmight be strictly necessary, rather than drive a man, at the Baronâs\ntime of life, who has been a faithful servant, to extremities. And\nthis is unavoidable if he does not succeed in his present attempt. What\nhe asks would, all calculations made, terminate in this, an allowance\nof his five hundred and eighty guineas a year. He only wishes a\nrecognition of the contract. He knows that until affairs mend no money\ncan be produced. I do not know how far it may be in your power to do\nhim any good; but I shall be mistaken if the considerations I have\nmentioned do not appear to your Excellency to have some weight.\n\n                                I remain, with great respect and esteem,\n                                Your Excellencyâs obedient servant,\n                                A. Hamilton.\n\nHis Excellency General Washington.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                               Mount Vernon, November 10, 1787.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI thank you for the pamphlet, and for the Gazette, contained in your\nletter of the 30th ult. For the remaining numbers of Publius, I shall\nacknowledge myself obliged, as I am persuaded the subject will be well\nhandled by the author.\n\nThe new constitution has, as the public prints will have informed\nyou, been handed to the people of this State by a unanimous vote\nof the Assembly, but it is not to be inferred from hence that its\nopponents are silenced. On the contrary there are many, and some\npowerful ones--some of whom, it is said, by _overshooting_ the mark,\nhave lessened their weight; be this as it may, their assiduity stands\nunrivalled, whilst the friends to the constitution content themselves\nwith barely avowing their approbation of it. Thus stands the matter\nwith us at present, yet my opinion is that the major voice is favorable.\n\nApplication has been made to me by Mr. Secretary Thompson (by order\nof Congress), for a copy of the report of a committee, which was\nappointed to confer with the Baron De Steuben, on his first arrival\nin this country, forwarded to me by Mr. President Laurens. This I\nhave accordingly sent. It throws no other light on the subject than\nsuch as is to be derived from the disinterested conduct of the Baron.\nNo terms are made by him, ânor will he accept of any thing but with\ngeneral approbation.â I have, however, in my letter inclosing this\nreport to the Secretary, taken occasion to express an unequivocal wish\nthat Congress would reward the Baron for his services, sacrifices,\nand merits, to his entire satisfaction. It is the only way in which I\ncould bring my sentiments before that honorable body, as it has been an\nestablished principle with me, to ask nothing from it.\n\n                                      With very great esteem and regard,\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\n                                      G. Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO JAMES MADISON, JUNR.\n\n\n                                       New-York, April 3, 1788.\n\nI have been very delinquent, my dear sir, in not thanking you for your\nletter from Philadelphia. The remarks you made on a certain subject are\nimportant, and will be attended to.\n\nThere is truly much embarrassment in the case.\n\nI think, however, the principles we have talked of, are not only just,\nbut will apply to the other departments. Nor will the consequences\nappear so disagreeable as they may seem at first sight, when we attend\nto the true import of the rule established. The States _retain_ all\nthe authorities they were before possessed of, not alienated in the\nthree modes pointed out; but this does not include cases which are\nthe creatures of the new Constitution. For instance, the crime of\ntreason against the United States _immediately_ is a crime known only\nto the new Constitution. There of course _was_ no power in the State\nconstitutions to pardon that crime. There will therefore be none under\nthe new, &c. This is something like, it seems to me, to afford the\nbest solution of the difficulty. I send you the Federalist from the\nbeginning to the conclusion of the commentary on the Executive Branch.\nIf our suspicions of the author be right, he must be too much engaged\nto make a rapid progress in what remains. The Court of Chancery and a\nCircuit Court are now sitting.\n\nWe are told that your election has succeeded, with which we all\nfelicitate ourselves. I will thank you for an account of the result\ngenerally. In this State our prospects are much as you left them. A\nmoot point which side will prevail. Our friends to the northward are\nactive.\n\n                                     I remain,\n                                     Your affectionate obedient servant,\n                                     A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                                                            May 4, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI believe I am in your debt a letter or two, which is owing to my\noccupation in relation to the elections, &c.\n\nThese are now over in this State, but the result is not known. All\ndepends upon Albany, where both sides claim the victory. Our doubts\nwill not be removed till the latter end of the month. I hope your\nexpectations of Virginia have not diminished.\n\nRespecting the first volume of Publius I have executed your commands.\nThe books have been sent addressed to the care of Governor Randolph.\nThe second, we are informed, will be out in the course of a week, and\nan equal number shall be forwarded. Inclosed is a letter, committed to\nmy care by Mr. Vanderkemp, which I forward with pleasure.\n\n                                      Believe me, with great attachment,\n                                      Yours,\n                                      A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\n\n\n                                        New-York, May 19, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge my delinquency in not thanking you before for your\nobliging letter from Richmond. But the truth is, that I have been so\noverwhelmed in avocations of one kind or another, that I have scarcely\nhad a moment to spare to a friend. You, I trust, will be the less\ndisposed to be inexorable, as I hope you will believe there is no one\nfor whom I have more inclination than yourself--I mean of the _male_\nkind.\n\nYour account of the situation of Virginia was interesting, and the\npresent appearances, as represented here, justify your conjectures. It\ndoes not, however, appear that the adoption of the constitution can be\nconsidered as out of doubt in that State. Its conduct upon the occasion\nwill certainly be of critical importance.\n\nIn this State, as far as we can judge, the elections have gone wrong.\nThe event, however, will not certainly be known till the end of the\nmonth. Violence, rather than moderation, is to be looked for from the\nopposite party. Obstinacy seems the prevailing trait in the character\nof its leader. The language is, that if all the other States adopt,\nthis is to persist in refusing the constitution. It is reduced to a\ncertainty, that Clinton has in several conversations declared the\n_Union_ unnecessary; though I have the information through channels\nwhich do not permit a public use to be made of it.\n\nWe have, notwithstanding this unfavorable complexion of things, two\nsources of hope--one, the chance of a ratification by nine States,\nbefore we decide, and the influence of this upon the firmness of the\n_followers_; the other, the probability of a change of sentiment in the\npeople, auspicious to the Constitution.\n\nThe current has been for some time running towards it; though the whole\nflood of official influence, accelerated by a torrent of falsehood,\nearly gave the public opinion so violent a direction in a wrong\nchannel, that it was not possible suddenly to alter its course. This\nis a mighty stiff simile; but you know what I mean; and after having\nstarted it, I did not choose to give up the chase.\n\n                                                 Adieu. Yours sincerely,\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\n\nThe members of the Convention in this city, by a majority of nine or\nten to one, will be:--John Jay, Robert R. Livingston, Richard Morris,\nJohn Sloss Hobart, James Duane, Isaac Rosevelt, Richard Harrison,\nNicholas Low, Alexander Hamilton.\n\nG. Morris, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                                        New-York, May 19, 1788.\n\nSome days since, I wrote to you, my dear sir, inclosing a letter from a\nMr. Vanderkemp, &c.\n\nI then mentioned to you that the question of a majority for or against\nthe Constitution, would depend upon the County of Albany. By the later\naccounts from that quarter, I fear much that the issue there has been\nagainst us.\n\nAs Clinton is truly the leader of his party, and is inflexibly\nobstinate, I count little on overcoming opposition by reason. Our only\nchances will be the previous ratification by nine States, which may\nshake the firmness of his followers; and a change in the sentiments\nof the people, which have, for some time, been travelling towards the\nConstitution, though the first impressions, made by every species of\ninfluence and artifice, were too strong to be eradicated in time to\ngive a decisive turn to the elections. We shall leave nothing undone to\ncultivate a favorable disposition in the citizens at large.\n\nThe language of the Anti-federalists is, that if all the other States\nadopt, New-York ought still to hold out. I have the most direct\nintelligence, but in a manner which forbids a public use being made\nof it, that Clinton has, in several conversations, declared his\nopinion of the _inutility_ of the Union. It is an unhappy\nreflection, that the friends to it should, by quarrelling for straws\namong themselves, promote the designs of its adversaries. We think here\nthat the situation of your State is critical. Let me know what you\nnow think of it. I believe you meet nearly at the time we do. It will\nbe of vast importance that an exact communication should be kept up\nbetween us at that period; and the moment _any decisive_ question is\ntaken, if favorable, I request you to dispatch an express to me with\npointed orders to make all possible diligence, by changing horses, &c.\nAll expense shall be thankfully and liberally paid. I executed your\ncommands respecting the first volume of the Federalist. I sent forty of\nthe common copies and twelve of the finer ones, addressed to the care\nof Governor Randolph. The printer announces the second volume in a day\nor two, when an equal number of the two kinds shall also be forwarded.\nHe informs that the Judicial Department--Trial by Jury--Bill of Rights,\n&c., is discussed in some additional papers which have not yet appeared\nin the Gazettes.\n\n                                    I remain,\n                                    With great sincerity and attachment,\n                                    Yours,\n                                    A. Hamilton.\n\nJames Madison.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                                        New-York, June 8, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nIn my last, I think, I informed you that the elections had turned out,\nbeyond expectation, favorable to the Anti-federal party. They have a\nmajority of two-thirds in the Convention, and, according to the best\nestimate I can form, of about four-sevenths in the community. The\nviews of the leaders in this city are pretty well ascertained to be\nturned towards a _long_ adjournment; say, till next spring or summer.\nTheir incautious ones observe, that this will give an opportunity to\nthe State to _see how_ the government works, and to act according to\n_circumstances_.\n\nMy reasonings on the fact are to this effect: The leaders of the\nparty hostile to the Constitution are equally hostile to the Union.\nThey are, however, afraid to reject the Constitution at once, because\nthat step would bring matters to a crisis between this State and the\nStates which had adopted the Constitution, and between the parties\nin the State. A separation of the Southern District from the other\nparts of the State, it is perceived, would become the object of the\nFederalists, and of the neighboring States. They therefore resolve upon\na long adjournment, as the safest and most artful course to effect\ntheir final purpose. They suppose, that when the Government gets into\noperation, it will be obliged to take some steps in respect to revenue,\n&c., which will furnish topics of declamation to its enemies in the\nseveral States, and will strengthen the minorities. If any considerable\ndiscontent should show itself, they will stand ready to head the\nopposition. If, on the contrary, the thing should go on smoothly, and\nthe sentiments of our own people should change, they can elect to come\ninto the Union. They at all events take the chances of time and the\nchapter of accidents.\n\nHow far their friends in the country will go with them, I am not able\nto say, but, as they have always been found very obsequious, we have\nlittle reason to calculate upon an uncompliant temper in the present\ninstance. For my own part, the more I can penetrate the views of the\nAnti-federal party in this State, the more I dread the consequences of\nthe non-adoption of the Constitution by any of the other States--the\nmore I fear an eventual disunion, and civil war. God grant that\nVirginia may accede. The example will have a vast influence on our\npolitics. New Hampshire, all accounts give us to expect, will be an\nassenting State.\n\nThe number of the volumes of the Federalist which you desired, have\nbeen forwarded, as well the second as the first, to the care of\nGovernor Randolph. It was impossible to correct a certain error.\n\nIn a former letter, I requested you to communicate to me, by express,\nthe event of any decisive question in favor of the Constitution,\nauthorizing changes of horses, &c., with an assurance to the person\nthat he will be liberally paid for his diligence.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\nJames Madison.\n\n\n\n\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                        Richmond, June 9, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe heat of the weather, &c., has laid me up with a bilious attack: I\nam not able, therefore, to say more than a few words.\n\nNo material indications have taken place since my last. The chance at\npresent seems to be in our favor. But it is possible things may take\nanother turn. Oswald of Philadelphia came here on Saturday; and has\ncloset interviews with the leaders of the opposition.\n\n                                                  Yours, affectionately,\n                                                  J. Madison.\n\nAlex. Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nRUFUS KING TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                         Boston, June 12, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have made an arrangement to forward by express the result of the\nConvention of New Hampshire to Springfield, in this State, from which\nplace Gen. Knox has engaged a conveyance to you at Poughkeepsie.\nThose who are best informed of the situation of the question, in New\nHampshire, are positive that the decision will be such as we wish, and\nfrom the particular parts which I have heard, I can entertain no fear\nof a disappointment from that quarter. The accession of New Hampshire\nwill present the subject to your Convention in a new, and indeed, an\nextraordinary light. I think your opponents, powerful as they may be,\nwill be greatly perplexed, although they may outnumber you, and a small\nmajority of the people of the State may be on their side, yet I cannot\nthink they will have the hardiness to negative the question.\n\nYou may pronounce, with the utmost confidence, that the decision of\nour Convention has proved entirely satisfactory to our people. I have\nmade a business of conversing with men from all parts of the State,\nand am completely satisfied that the Constitution is highly popular;\nthat its opponents are now very few, and those few hourly diminishing.\nBe assured that the organization of the Government (by _nine States_,\nis considered as certain), although a subject of delicacy, is most\nearnestly desired, and from the conversation of both yeoman and\npolitician, I am persuaded, that the people of Massachusetts are\nsufficiently mature and firm, to execute, so far as depends on them,\nwhat shall be proper as good subjects of the new Government.\n\n                                                    Farewell.\n                                                    Yours, &c.,\n                                                    Rufus King.\n\nCol. A. Hamilton.\n\nPray mention to Knox that I should have written to him had I not\nsupposed him on his way here.\n\n\n\n\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Richmond, June 16, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of the 8th has just come to hand. I mentioned in my last that\nOswald had been here in consultation with the Anti-federal leaders.\nThe contents of your letter confirm the idea that a requisition for\ndelay is on foot between the opposition here and with you. We have\nconjectured for some days, that the policy is to spin out the session,\nin order to receive overtures from your Convention; or, if that cannot\nbe, to weary the members into an adjournment, without taking any\ndecision. It is presumed, at the same time, that they do not despair of\ncarrying the point of previous amendments, which is preferable game.\nThe parties continue to be nearly balanced. If we have a majority at\nall, it does not exceed three or four. If we lose it, Kentucke will be\nthe cause; they are generally, if not unanimously against us.\n\nI have been partially recovered since my last, but to-day have a sort\nof relapse.

We possess, as yet, in defiance of great overtures, a\nmajority, but very small indeed.\n\nA correspondence has certainly been opened through a Mr. O. of\nPhiladelphia, from the malcontents of P. and N. Y. to us. It has its\noperation, but I believe we are still safe, unless the question of\nadjournment be introduced, and love of home may induce some of our\nfriends to abandon their principles.\n\n                                                        Adieu,\n                                                        H.

The appellate cognizance of fact,\nand an extension of the power to causes between citizens of different\nStates, with some lesser objections, are the topics chiefly dwelt on.\nThe retrospection to cases antecedent to the Constitution, such as\nBritish debts, and an apprehended revival of the Fairfax, Indiana,\nVandalia, &c., claims, are also brought into view in all the terrific\ncolors which imagination can give them. A few days more will probably\nproduce a decision, though it is surmised, that something is expected\nfrom your Convention in consequence of the mission formerly suggested\nto you. Delay and an adjournment will be tried, if the adverse party\nfind their numbers inferior, and can prevail on themselves to remain\nhere till the other side can be wearied into that mode of relieving\nthemselves. At present, it is calculated, that we still retain a\nmajority of three or four; and if we can weather the storm against\nthe part under consideration, I shall hold the danger to be pretty\nwell over. There is nevertheless a very disagreeable uncertainty in\nthe case; and the more so, as there is a possibility that our present\nstrength may be miscalculated.\n\n                                                Yours, affectionately,\n                                                J.

I regret that your\nprospects are not yet reduced to greater certainty. There is more and\nmore reason to believe that our conduct will be influenced by yours.\n\nOur discussions have not yet travelled beyond the power of taxation.\nTo-day we shall probably quit this ground to pass to another. Our\narguments confound, but do not convince. Some of the leaders, however,\nappear to be convinced by _circumstances_, and to be desirous of a\nretreat. This does not apply to the chief, who wishes to establish\nClintonism on the basis of Anti-federalism.\n\n                                          I remain affectionately yours,\n                                          A.

That day and\nthis have been spent in preliminary arrangements. To-morrow, we go\ninto a committee of the whole on the Constitution. There is every\nappearance that a full discussion will take place, which will keep us\ntogether at least a fortnight. It is not easy to conjecture what will\nbe the result. Our adversaries greatly outnumber us. The leaders gave\nindications of a pretty desperate disposition in private conversations\nprevious to the meeting; but I imagine the minor partisans have their\nscruples, and an air of moderation is now assumed. So far the thing\nis not despaired of. A happy issue with you must have considerable\ninfluence upon us. I have time to add nothing more than the assurances\nof my sincere attachment.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                                   Poughkeepsie, June 21, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI thank you for your letter of the 9th instant, and am glad to learn\nthat you think the chance is in your favor. I hope no disagreeable\nchange may appear. Yet, I own I fear something from your indisposition.\n\nOur debate here began on the clause respecting the proportion of\nrepresentation, &c., which has taken up two days. To-morrow, I imagine,\nwe shall talk about the power over elections. The only good information\nI can give you is, that we shall be some time together, and take the\nchance of events.\n\nThe object of the party at present is undoubtedly conditional\namendments. What effect events may have cannot precisely be foreseen. I\nbelieve the adoption by New Hampshire is certain.\n\n                                                  Yours, affectionately,\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Richmond, June 22, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Judiciary Department has been on the anvil for several days,\nand I presume will still be a further subject of disquisition. The\nattacks on it have apparently made less impression than was feared.\nBut they may be secretly felt by particular interests that could\nnot make the acknowledgment, and we choose to ground their vote\nagainst the Constitution in other motives. In the course of this\nweek we hope for a close of the business in some form or other. The\nopponents will probably bring forward a bill of rights, with sundry\nother amendments, as conditions of ratification. Should these fail,\nor be despaired of, an adjournment will, I think, be attempted. And\nin case of disappointment here also, some predict a secession. I do\nnot myself concur in the last apprehension, though I have thought\nit prudent to withhold, by a studied fairness in every step on the\nside of the Constitution, every pretext for rash experiments. The\nplan meditated by the friends of the Constitution is to preface the\nratification with some plain and general truths that cannot affect\nthe validity of the act, and to subjoin a recommendation, which may\nhold up amendments as objects to be pursued in the constitutional\nmode. These expedients are rendered prudent by the nice balance of\nnumbers, and the scruples entertained by some who are in general well\naffected. Whether they will secure us a majority, I dare not positively\nto declare. Our calculations promise us success by three or four, or\npossibly five or six votes. But were there no possibility of mistaking\nthe opinions of some, in reviewing those of so many, the smallness\nof the majority suggests the danger from ordinary casualties, which\nmay vary the result. It unluckily happens that our legislature, which\nmeets at this place to-morrow, consists of a considerable majority of\nAnti-federal members. This is another circumstance that ought to check\nour confidence. As individuals they may have some influence; and, as\ncoming immediately from the people at large, they can give any color\nthey please to the popular sentiments at this moment, and may in that\nmode throw a bias on the representatives of the people in Convention.\n\n                                                Yours, affectionately,\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                   Poughkeepsie, Friday morning, June 27, 1788.\n\nA day or two ago, General Schuyler, at my request, sent forward to you\nan express with an account of the adoption of the Constitution by New\nHampshire. We eagerly wait for further intelligence from you, as our\nchance of success depends upon you. There are some slight symptoms of\nrelaxation in some of the leaders, which authorizes a gleam of hope, if\nyou do well, but certainly I think not otherwise.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\nTo Hon. James Madison, Jr.\n\n\n\n\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Richmond, June 27, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nThis day put an end to the existence of our Convention. The inclosed\nis a copy of the Act of Ratification. It has been followed by a number\nof recommendatory alterations, many of them highly objectionable. One\nof the most so is an article prohibiting direct taxes where effectual\nlaws shall be passed by the States for the purpose. It was impossible\nto prevent this error. The minority will sign an address to the people.\nThe genius of it is unknown to me. It is announced as an exhortation\nto acquiesce in the result of the Convention. Notwithstanding the\nfair propositions made by some, I am so uncharitable as to suspect,\nthat the ill-will to the Constitution will produce every peaceable\neffort to disgrace and destroy it. Mr. Henry declared, previous to the\nfinal question, that although he should submit as a quiet citizen, he\nshould wait with impatience for the favorable moment of regaining,\nin a _constitutional way_, the lost liberties of his country. My\nconjecture is, that exertions will be made to engage two-thirds of the\nlegislatures in the task of regularly undermining the Government. This\nhint may not be unworthy of your attention.\n\n                                                Yours, affectionately,\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\n\n\n\n\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                        June 31, 1788.\n\nInclosed is the final result of our conventional deliberations. The\nintended address of the minority proved to be of a nature apprehended\nby me. It was rejected by the party themselves, when proposed to them,\nand produced an auspicious conclusion to the business. As I shall set\nout in a few days for New-York, I postpone further explanations. I have\nthis instant the communications from New Hampshire via Poughkeepsie;\nalso, your two favors of the 19th and 20th.\n\n                                                Yours, affectionately,\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                                                           July 8, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI felicitate you sincerely on the event in Virginia, but my\nsatisfaction will be allayed if I discover too much facility in the\nbusiness of amendment-making. I fear the system will be wounded in\nsome of its vital parts by too general a concurrence in some very\ninjudicious recommendations. I allude more particularly to the power of\ntaxation. The more I consider _requisition_ in any shape, the more I\nam out of humor with it. We yesterday passed through the Constitution.\nTo-day some definitive proposition is to be brought forward, but\nwhat we are at a loss to judge. We have good reason to believe that\nour opponents are not agreed, and this affords some ground of hope.\nDifferent things are thought of--_conditions precedent_, or previous\namendments; _conditions subsequent_, or the proposition of amendments,\nupon condition that if they are not adopted within a limited time,\nthe State shall be at liberty to _withdraw_ from the Union; and\nlastly, _recommendatory amendments_. In either case, _constructive\ndeclarations_ will be carried as far as possible. We will go as\nfar as we can in the latter without invalidating the act, and will\nconcur in rational recommendations. The rest for our opponents. We\nare informed there has been a disturbance in the city of Albany, on\nthe 4th of July, which has occasioned bloodshed. The Anti-federalists\nwere the aggressors, and the Federalists the victors. Thus stand our\naccounts at present. We trust, however, the matter has passed over, and\ntranquillity been restored.\n\n                                                  Yours, affectionately,\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                            Poughkeepsie, Saturday, July, 1788.\n\nI thank you, my dear sir, for yours by the post. Yesterday, I\ncommunicated to Duer our situation, which I presume he will have\ncommunicated to you. It remains exactly the same. No further question\nhaving been taken, I fear the footing I mentioned to Duer is the\nbest upon which it can be placed; but every thing possible will yet\nbe attempted to bring the party from that stand to an unqualified\nratification. Let me know your idea upon the possibility of our being\nreceived on that plan. You will understand that the only qualification\nwill be the _reservation_ of a right to recede, in case our amendments\nhave not been decided upon in one of the modes pointed out by the\nConstitution within a certain number of years, perhaps five or seven.\nIf this can in the first instance be admitted as a ratification, I do\nnot fear any further consequences. Congress will, I presume, recommend\ncertain amendments to render the _structure_ of the Government more\nsecure. This will satisfy the more considerate and honest opposers of\nthe Constitution, and with the aid of them will break up the party.\n\n                                                  Yours, affectionately,\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      New-York, Sunday evening.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nYours, of yesterday, is this instant come to hand, and I have but a\nfew minutes to answer it. I am sorry that your situation obliges you\nto listen to propositions of the nature you describe. My opinion is,\nthat a reservation of a right to withdraw, if amendments be not decided\non under the form of the Constitution within a certain time, is a\n_conditional_ ratification; that it does not make New-York a member of\nthe new Union, and consequently that she could not be received on that\nplan. Compacts must be reciprocal--this principle would not in such a\ncase be preserved. The Constitution requires an adoption _in toto_ and\n_for ever_. It has been so adopted by the other States. An adoption\nfor a limited time would be as defective as an adoption of some of the\narticles only. In short, any _condition_ whatever must vitiate the\nratification. What the new Congress, by virtue of the power to admit\nnew States, may be _able_ and disposed to do in such case, I do not\ninquire, as I suppose that is not the material point at present. I\nhave not a moment to add more than my fervent wishes for your success\nand happiness. The idea of reserving a right to withdraw was started\nat Richmond, and considered as a conditional ratification, which was\nitself abandoned as worse than a rejection.\n\n                                             Yours,\n                                             James Madison, Jr.\n\n\n\n\nCHIPMAN TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                       Tinmouth, July 14, 1788.\n\nSir:\n\nYour character as a federalist has induced me, although, personally\nunknown to you, to address you on a subject of very great importance\nto the State of Vermont, of which I am a citizen, and from which I\nthink may be derived a considerable advantage to the federal cause. Ten\nStates have now adopted the new federal plan of government. That it\nwill now succeed is beyond a doubt; what disputes the other States may\noccasion I know not. The people of this State, could certain obstacles\nbe removed, I believe, might be induced almost unanimously to throw\nthemselves into the federal scale. You are not unacquainted with the\nsituation of a considerable part of our landed property. Many grants\nwere formerly made by the government of New-York, of lands within\nthis territory while under that jurisdiction. On the assumption of\ngovernment by the people of this State, the same lands, partly, it is\nsaid, for want of information respecting the true situation of these\ngrants, and partly from the opinion prevailing with our then leaders,\nthat the New-York grants within this territory were of no validity,\nhave been granted to others under the authority of this State.\n\nIt is now generally believed that, should we be received into the\nUnion, the New-York grants would, in the federal courts, be preferred\nto those of Vermont. The Legislature of this State have in some\ninstances made a compensation to the grantees under New-York, and I\nam persuaded, were it in their power, would gladly do the same for\nothers, but they are possessed of no more land for that purpose.\nFor these reasons, I presume no others, the Governor and some few\ngentlemen deeply interested in those lands under Vermont, have\nexpressed themselves somewhat bitterly against the new federal plan of\ngovernment. Indeed, were we to be admitted unconditionally it would\nintroduce much confusion. Now, sir, permit me to ask whether you do not\nthink it probable that the federal legislature, when formed, might, on\nour accession, be induced on some terms to make a compensation to the\nNew-York grantees out of their western land? And whether those grantees\nmight not be induced to accept of such compensation? Let me further\nsuggest whether it might be favorable for Vermont to make some of those\namendments, which have been proposed by several States, and which, I\nthink, are generally within the power of the federal legislature, the\nbasis of her admission. Could the difficulties I have mentioned be\nremoved, all interest in opposition could here be reconciled. The idea\nof procuring justice to be done those whom we had perhaps injured by\nour too precipitate measures, and of being connected with a Government\nwhich promises to be efficient, permanent, and honorable, would, I am\npersuaded, produce the greatest unanimity on the subject. If you think\nthese matters worthy the attention of the friends of the Confederacy,\nbe good enough to write me by my brother, who will be the bearer of\nthis.\n\nOur Legislature will meet in October, when these matters will be taken\nup seriously. Several gentlemen of my acquaintance, who are men of\ninfluence, and will be members of the Legislature, have requested me to\nprocure all the information in my power on this subject. Any thing you\nmay communicate to me in confidence will be sacredly attended to, of\nwhich Mr. Kelly, who writes by the same opportunity, will give you the\nfullest assurance.\n\n                                   I am, Sir, with sentiments of esteem,\n                                   Your most obedient servant,\n                                   Nathaniel Chipman.\n\nAlex. Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO CHIPMAN.\n\n\n                                   Poughkeepsie, July 22, 1788.\n\nSir:\n\nYour brother delivered me your favor, which I received with pleasure,\nas the basis of a correspondence that may be productive of public\ngood. The accession of Vermont to the Confederacy is, doubtless, an\nobject of great importance to the whole; and it appears to me that this\nis the favorable moment for effecting it upon the best terms for all\nconcerned. Besides more general reasons, there are circumstances of\nthe moment which will forward a proper arrangement. One of the first\nsubjects of deliberation with the new Congress will be the independence\nof Kentucky, for which the Southern States will be anxious. The\nNorthern will be glad to send a counterpoise in Vermont. These mutual\ninterests and inclinations will facilitate a proper result.\n\nI see nothing that can stand in your way but the interfering claims\nunder the grants of New-York. As to taxation, the natural operation of\nthe new system will place you exactly where you might wish to be. The\npublic debt, as far as it can prudently be provided for, will be by the\nWestern lands and the appropriation of some general fund. _There will\nbe no distribution of it to particular parts of the community._ The\nfund will be sought for in indirect taxation; as for a number of years,\nand except in time of war, direct taxes would be an impolitic measure.\nHence, as you can have no objection to your proportion of contribution\nas consumers, you can fear nothing from the article of taxation.\n\nI readily conceive that it will hardly be practicable to you to come\ninto the Union unless you are secured from claims under New-York\ngrants. Upon the whole, therefore, I think it will be expedient for\nyou, as early as possible, to ratify the Constitution, âupon condition\nthat Congress shall provide for the extinguishment of all existing\nclaims to land under grants of the State of New-York, which may\ninterfere with claims under the grants of the State of Vermont.â You\nwill do well to conform your boundary to that heretofore marked out by\nCongress, otherwise insuperable difficulties would be likely to arise\nwith this State.\n\nI should think it altogether unadvisable to annex any other conditions\nto your ratification; for there is scarcely any of the amendments\nproposed that will not have a party opposed to it, and there are\nseveral that will meet with a very strong opposition; and it would,\ntherefore, be highly inexpedient for you to embarrass your main object\nby any collateral difficulties.\n\nAs I write in Convention, I have it not in my power to enlarge. You\nwill perceive my general ideas on the subject. I will only add, that it\nwill be wise to lay as little impediment as possible in the way of your\nreception into the Union.\n\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                                   Poughkeepsie, July 22, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI wrote to you by the last post, since which nothing material has\nturned up here. We are debating on amendments without having decided\nwhat is to be done with them. There is so great a diversity in the\nviews of our opponents that it is impossible to predict any thing. Upon\nthe whole, however, our fears diminish.\n\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\n                                                   A.

I recollect\nthat one of them contains an inquiry concerning your son, to which you\nwill naturally desire an answer. My public avocations, for some time\npast, have put it out of my power to ascertain the progress he has\nmade; though I expect, when I shall be enough disengaged to examine, to\nfind it a good one. It cannot fail to be so, if his diligence has been\nequal to his capacity. I shall shortly write you further on the subject.\n\n                                                  With great esteem,\n                                                  I remain, Sir,\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\n\nMr. Samuel Broome.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                     New-York, August 18, 1788.\n\nSir:\n\nCaptain Cochran of the British navy has requested my aid in recovering\na family watch in the possession of ----. In compliance with his\nrequest, I have written the letter herewith (to ---- ----), which\nI take the liberty to convey through you, in hope that if you see\nno impropriety in it, you would add your influence to the endeavor\nto gratify Captain Cochran. It is one of those things in which the\naffections are apt to be interested beyond the value of the object, and\nin which one naturally feels an inclination to oblige.\n\nI have delivered to Mr. Madison, to be forwarded to you, a set of\nthe papers under the signature of Publius, neatly enough bound to be\nhonored with a place in your library. I presume you have understood\nthat the writers of these papers are chiefly Mr. Madison and myself,\nwith some aid from Mr. Jay.\n\nI take it for granted, sir, you have concluded to comply with what will\nno doubt be the general call of your country in relation to the new\nGovernment. You will permit me to say that it is indispensable you\nshould lend yourself to its first operations. It is of little purpose\nto have _introduced_ a system, if the weightiest influence is not given\nto its firm _establishment_ in the outset.\n\n                                      I remain with the greatest esteem,\n                                      Your obedient and humble servant,\n                                      A. Hamilton.\n\nGeneral Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON.\n\n\n                                     New-York, August 29, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are informed here, that there is some probability that your\nLegislature will instruct your delegates to vote for Philadelphia\nas the place of the meeting of the first Congress under the new\nGovernment. I presume this information can hardly be well founded,\nas upon my calculations, there is not a State in the Union so much\ninterested in having the temporary residence at New-York, as New Jersey.\n\nAs between Philadelphia and New-York, I am mistaken if a greater\nproportion of your State will not be benefited by having the seat of\ngovernment at the latter than the former place.\n\nIf at the latter, too, its exposed and eccentric position will\nnecessitate the early establishment of a permanent seat, and in passing\nsouth, it is highly probable the Government would light upon the\nDelaware in New Jersey. The Northern States do not wish to increase\nPennsylvania, by an accession of all the wealth and population of the\nFederal City. Pennsylvania, herself, when not seduced by _immediate\npossession_, will be glad to concur in a situation on the Jersey side\nof the Delaware. Here are at once a majority of the States; but place\nthe Government once down in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania will, of course,\nhold fast; the State of Delaware will do the same.\n\nAll the States south, looking forward to the time, when the balance\nof population will enable them to carry the Government further south\n(say to the Potomac), and being accommodated in the mean time as well\nas they wish, will concur in no change. The Government, from the delay,\nwill take root in Philadelphia, and Jersey will lose all prospect of\nthe Federal City within her limits.\n\nThese appear to me calculations so obvious, that I cannot persuade\nmyself New Jersey will so much _oversee_ her interest as to fall, in\nthe present instance, into the snares of Pennsylvania.\n\n                                  With the sincerest respect and regard,\n                                  I remain, dear Sir,\n                                  Your obedient servant,\n                                  A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nCHIPMAN TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                        Newfane, Sept. 6, 1788.\n\nSir:\n\nI have received by Capt. Ville, your favor of the 22d of July. Since I\nwrote you, I have had an opportunity of conversing with his Excellency,\nthe Governor, and most of the council, on the subject of Vermontâs\naccession to the Confederacy. They generally agree, that the terms\nsuggested are good; that it will be highly the interest of Vermont to\naccede; and that the present is likely to be a favorable crisis. But it\nis a question whether we ought to make any propositions to the present\nCongress, or prepare matters, and wait the new arrangement. Vermont\nwill not make a point of introducing any amendments. We shall not be\nthe first to feel the inconveniences, if any should arise, from the\nexercise of the new federal powers. For myself, I readily conceive,\nthat direct taxation, under the new system, will be very inconsiderable\nduring the continuance of peace; yet I find an exemption from the\nexpenses of the late war will have with the citizens of this State a\nvery powerful effect in producing unanimity on the subject of a Union.\n\nBut I hope this matter will in some way be compromised. If, sir, you\nhave any thing to suggest on this subject, that may promote the public\ngood, I should be very happy in the communication, previous to the\nsession of Assembly in October next. The choice of representatives,\nwhich was on Tuesday last, has, as far as I have heard, succeeded\nfavorably. Mr. Kelly, who is so obliging as to take charge of this\nletter, will be able to give you a more particular account than can\nbe done in this way, as he has conversed largely with the Governor,\nCouncil, and other persons of influence, with whom he has great weight.\n\n                                           I am, Sir,\n                                           With much esteem and respect,\n                                           Your most obedient servant,\n                                           Nathl. Chipman.\n\nA. Hamilton, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                     New-York, September, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour Excellencyâs friendly and obliging letter of the 28th ultimo,\ncame safely to hand. I thank you for your assurance of seconding my\napplication to General ----. The truth of that affair is, that he\npurchased the watch for a trifle of a British soldier, who plundered\nMajor Cochran, at the moment of his fall, at Yorktown.\n\nI should be deeply pained, my dear sir, if your scruples in regard to\na certain station, should be matured into a resolution to decline it;\nthough I am neither surprised at their existence, nor can I but agree\nin opinion, that the caution you observe, in deferring an ultimate\ndetermination, is prudent. I have, however, reflected maturely on the\nsubject, and have come to a conclusion (in which I feel no hesitation),\nthat every public and personal consideration will demand from you an\nacquiescence in what will _certainly_ be the unanimous wish of your\ncountry. The absolute retreat which you meditated at the close of\nthe late war was natural, and proper. Had the Government produced by\nthe revolution, gone on in a _tolerable_ train, it would have been\nmost advisable to have persisted in that retreat. But I am clearly of\nopinion, that the crisis which brought you again into public view,\nleft you no alternative but to comply; and I am equally clear in\nthe opinion, that you are by that act _pledged_ to take a part in\nthe execution of the Government. I am not less convinced, that the\nimpression of this necessity of your filling the station in question,\nis so universal, that you run no risk of any uncandid imputation by\nsubmitting to it. But even if this were not the case, a regard to your\nown reputation, as well as to the public good, calls upon you in the\nstrongest manner, to run that risk.\n\nIt cannot be considered as a compliment to say, that on your acceptance\nof the office of President, the success of the new Government, in its\ncommencement, may materially depend. Your agency and influence will\nbe not less important in preserving it from the future attacks of its\nenemies, than they have been in recommending it in the first instance,\nto the adoption of the people. Independent of all considerations drawn\nfrom this source, the point of light in which you stand at home and\nabroad, will make an infinite difference in the respectability with\nwhich the Government will begin its operations, in the alternative\nof your being or not being at the head of it. I forbear to urge\nconsiderations which might have a more personal application. What I\nhave said will suffice for the inferences I mean to draw.\n\nFirst. In a matter so essential to the well-being of society, as the\nprosperity of a newly instituted government, a citizen of so much\nconsequence as yourself to its success, has no option but to lend his\nservices if called for. Permit me to say, it would be inglorious, in\nsuch a situation, not to hazard the glory, however great, which he\nmight have previously acquired.\n\nSecondly. Your signature to the proposed system, pledges your judgment\nfor its being such an one as, upon the whole, was worthy of the public\napprobation. If it should miscarry (as men commonly decide from\nsuccess, or the want of it), the blame will, in all probability, be\nlaid on the system itself; and the framers of it will have to encounter\nthe disrepute of having brought about a revolution in government,\nwithout substituting any thing that was worthy of the effort. They\npulled down one Utopia, it will be said, to build up another. This view\nof the subject, if I mistake not, my dear sir, will suggest to your\nmind greater hazard to that fame, which must be and ought to be dear\nto you, in refusing your future aid to the system, than in affording\nit. I will only add, that in my estimate of the matter, that aid is\nindispensable.\n\nI have taken the liberty to express these sentiments, and to lay before\nyou my view of the subject. I doubt not the considerations mentioned,\nhave fully occurred to you, and I trust they will finally produce in\nyour mind the same result which exists in mine. I flatter myself, the\nfrankness with which I have delivered myself will not be displeasing to\nyou. It has been prompted by motives which you would not disapprove.\n\n                                  I remain, my dear Sir,\n                                  With the sincerest respect and regard,\n                                  Your obedient and humble servant,\n                                  A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSTEUBEN TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                                     Le 5 de Sept. 1788.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nLa lettre cây joint de Mr. R. Peters, contienne une preuve, non\nÃ©quivoque, que dans mes premiÃ¨res applications et immÃ©diatement aprÃ¨s\nla paix, jâai appuyÃ© mes prÃ©tentions aux E. U. sur une stipulation ou\ncontract fait en entrant dans leur service.\n\nComme vous Ã©tiez de cette mÃªme committÃ©e Ã  Philadelphie, je mâen\nrapporte Ã  votre mÃ©moire. Dans tous les committÃ©es subsÃ©quentes jâai\ntoujours appuyÃ© sur ce mÃªme contract, et je me rapporte Ã  tous les\nMessieurs qui successivement furent des committÃ©es sur ce sujet. Comme\nvous Ã©tes de la presente CongrÃ¨s, je vous prie de communiquer la\nreporte de Mr. Peters Ã  cette committÃ©e.\n\n                                   Jâai lâhonneur dâÃ¨tre avec affection,\n                                   Monsieur,\n                                   Votre trÃ¨s humble,\n                                   Steuben.\n\nAlexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THEODORE SEDGEWICK.\n\n\n                                        New-York, Oct. 9, 1788.\n\nYour last letter but one met me at Albany attending court, whence I\nam just returned. I am sorry for the schism you hint at among the\nFederalists, but I have so much confidence in the good management of\nthe fast friends of the Constitution, that I hope no ill consequences\nwill ensue from that disagreement. It will, however, be worthy of great\ncare to avoid suffering a difference of opinion on collateral points,\nto produce any serious division between those who have hitherto drawn\ntogether on the great national question. Permit me to add, that I do\nnot think you should allow any line to be run between those who wish\nto trust alterations to future experience, and those who are desirous\nof them at the present juncture. The rage for amendments is, in my\nopinion, rather to be parried by address than encountered with open\nforce; and I should therefore be loth to learn that your parties had\nbeen arrayed professedly upon the distinction I have mentioned.\n\nThe mode in which amendments may best be made, and twenty other\nmatters, may come as pretexts for avoiding the evil, and securing the\ngood.\n\n                                                   Yours,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO CHIPMAN.\n\n\n                                                                   1788.\n\nSir:\n\nYour favor of the 6th of September has been duly handed to me, and I\nreceive great pleasure from the hopes you appear to entertain of a\nfavorable turn of affairs in Vermont in regard to the new Government.\nIt is certainly an object of mutual importance to yourselves, and to\nthe Union, and well deserves the best endeavors of every discerning and\ngood man.\n\nI observe with satisfaction your opinion that Vermont will not make\na point of introducing amendments. I mean as a condition of her\naccession. That ground would be the most hazardous which she could\nventure upon, as it is very probable that such amendments as might\nbe popular with you would be deemed inadmissible by the friends of\nthe system, who will doubtless be the most influential persons in the\nnational councils; and who would rather submit to the inconvenience\nof your being out of the Union, till circumstances should alter, than\nconsent to any thing that might impair the energy of the Government.\nThe article of taxation is, above all, the most delicate thing to\nmeddle with; for as _plenary_ power in that respect must ever be\nconsidered as the vital principle of government, no abridgment\nor constitutional suspension of that power can ever, upon mature\nconsideration, be countenanced by the intelligent friends of an\neffective National Government. You must, as I remarked in my former\nletter, rely upon the natural course of things, which I am satisfied\nwill exempt you in ordinary times from direct taxation, on account\nof the difficulty of exercising it in so extensive a country, so\npeculiarly situated, with advantage to the revenue or satisfaction to\nthe people. Though this difficulty will be gradually diminished from\nvarious causes, a considerable time must first elapse; and, in the\ninterim, you will have nothing to apprehend on this score.\n\nAs far as indirect taxation is concerned, it will be impossible to\nexempt you from sharing in the burthen, nor can it be desired by your\ncitizens. I repeat these ideas to impress you the more strongly with\nmy sense of the danger of touching this chord, and of the impolicy\nof perplexing the main object with any such collateral experiments,\nwhile I am glad to perceive that you do not think your people will be\ntenacious on the point.\n\nIt will be useless for you to have any view in your act to the\npresent Congress. They can of course do nothing in the matter. All\nyou will have to do, will be to pass an act of accession to the new\nConstitution, on the conditions upon which you mean to rely. It will\nthen be for the new Government, when met, to declare whether you can be\nreceived on your terms or not.\n\nI am sorry to find that the affair of boundary is likely to create\nsome embarrassment. Menâs minds, every where out of your State, are\nmade up upon and reconciled to that which has been delineated by\nCongress. Any departure from it must beget new discussions, in which\nall the passions will have their usual scope, and may occasion greater\nimpediments than the real importance of the thing would justify. If,\nhowever, the further claims you state cannot be gotten over with you,\nI would still wish to see the experiment made, though with this clog,\nbecause I have it very much at heart that you should become a member\nof the Confederacy. It is, however, not to be inferred that the same\ndisposition will actuate every body. In this State, the pride of\ncertain individuals has too long triumphed over the public interest;\nand in several of the Southern States a jealousy of Northern influence\nwill prevent any great zeal for increasing in the national councils the\nnumber of Northern votes.\n\nI mention these circumstances (though I dare say they will have\noccurred to you), to show you the necessity of moderation and caution\non your part, and the error of any sanguine calculation upon a\ndisposition to receive you at any rate. A supposition of this nature\nmight lead to fatal mistakes.\n\nIn the event of an extension of your boundary beyond the Congressional\nline, would it be impracticable for you to have commissioners appointed\nto adjust any differences which might arise? I presume the principal\nobject with you in the extension of your boundary would be to cover\nsome private interests. This might be matter of negotiation. There is\none thing which I think it proper to mention to you, about which I have\nsome doubt; that is, whether a legislative accession would be deemed\nvalid. It is the policy of the system to lay its foundations in the\n_immediate_ consent of the people. You will best judge how far it is\nsafe or practicable to have recourse to a convention. Whatever you do,\nno time ought to be lost. The present moment is undoubtedly critically\nfavorable. Let it by all means be improved. I remain, with esteem, Sir,\n\n                                       Your obedient and humble servant,\n                                       A. Hamilton.\n\nNathaniel Chipman, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                 Mount Vernon, October 3, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn acknowledging the receipt of your candid and friendly letter of\n---- by the last post, little more is incumbent on me than to thank\nyou sincerely for the frankness with which you communicated your\nsentiments; and to assure you that the same manly tone of intercourse\nwill always be more than barely welcome. Indeed, it will be highly\nacceptable to me. I am particularly glad, in the present instance, you\nhave dealt thus freely and like a friend.\n\nAlthough I could not help observing from several publications and\nletters, that my name had been sometimes spoken of, and that it was\npossible the _contingency_ which is the subject of your letter might\nhappen; yet I thought it best to maintain a guarded silence and to back\nthe _counsel_ of my best friends (which I certainly hold in the highest\nestimation), rather than to hazard an imputation unfriendly to the\ndelicacy of my feelings. For, situated as I am, I could hardly bring\nthe question into the slightest discussion, or ask an opinion, even\nin the most confidential manner, without betraying, in my judgment,\nsome impropriety of conduct, or without feeling an apprehension that\na premature display of anxiety might be construed into a vain-glorious\ndesire of pushing myself into notice as a candidate. Now, if I am not\ngrossly deceived in myself, I should unfeignedly rejoice in case the\nElectors, by giving their votes in favor of some other person, would\nsave me from the disagreeable dilemma of being forced to accept or\nrefuse. If that may not be, I am in the next place earnestly desirous\nof searching out the truth, and of knowing whether there does not\nexist a probability that the Government would be just as happily and\neffectually carried into execution without my aid as with it. I am\n_truly_ solicitous to obtain all the previous information, which the\ncircumstances will afford, and to determine (when the determination can\nwith propriety be no longer postponed) according to the principles of\nright reason and the dictates of a clear conscience, without too great\na reference to the unforeseen consequences which may affect my person\nor reputation. Until that period, I may fairly hold myself open to\nconviction, though I allow your sentiments to have weight in them; and\nI shall not pass by your arguments without giving them as dispassionate\na consideration as I can possibly bestow on them.\n\nIn taking a survey of the subject in whatever point of light I have\nbeen able to place it, I will not suppress the acknowledgment, my dear\nsir, that I have always felt a kind of gloom upon my mind as often as\nI have been taught to expect I might, and perhaps must, ere long be\ncalled to make a decision. You will, I am well assured, believe the\nassertion (though I have little expectation it would gain credit from\nthose who are less acquainted with me), that if I should receive and\nact under the appointment, the acceptance would be attended with more\ndiffidence and reluctance than ever I experienced before in my life.\nIt would be, however, with a fixed and sole determination of lending\nwhatever assistance might be in my power to promote the public weal, in\nhopes that, at a convenient and an early period, my services might be\ndispensed with, and that I might be permitted once more to retire, to\npass an unclouded evening after the stormy day of life, in the bosom\nof domestic tranquillity. But why these anticipations? If the friends\nof the Constitution conceive that my administering the Government will\nbe the means of its acceleration and strength, is it not probable\nthat the adversaries thereof may entertain the same ideas, and of\ncourse make it an object of opposition? That many of this description\nwill be amongst the Electors, I have no more doubt than I have of\nthe part they will act at the election, which will be adverse to the\nchoice of any character who, from whatever cause, would be likely to\nthwart their views. It might be impolitic perhaps in them to make\nthis declaration _previous_ to the election, but I shall be out in my\nconjectures if they do not act conformably thereto at it, and prove\nthat all the _seeming_ moderation by which their present conduct is\nmarked, is calculated to lull and deceive. Their plan of opposition is\nsystematized, and a regular intercourse between the leaders of it in\nthe several States (I have much reason to believe) is formed to render\nit more effectual.\n\n                           With sentiments of sincere regard and esteem,\n                           I am, dear Sir,\n                           Your most obedient humble servant,\n                           George Washington.\n\nThe Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO THEODORE SEDGEWICK.\n\n\n                                     New-York, October 9, 1788.\n\nI thank you, my dear sir, for your obliging congratulations on the\nevent towards effecting which your aid as a joint laborer was so\nessential. I hope experience may show that, while it promotes the\ninterest of this place, it will not be incompatible with public good.\nWe are making efforts to prepare handsome accommodations for the\nsession of the new Congress.\n\nOn the subject of Vice-President, my ideas have concurred with\nyours, and I believe Mr. Adams will have the votes of this State.\nHe will certainly, I think, be preferred to the other gentleman.\nYet _certainly_ is perhaps too strong a word. I can conceive that\nthe other, who is supposed to be a more pliable man, may command\nanti-federal influence.\n\nThe only hesitation in my mind with regard to Mr. Adams has arisen\nwithin a day or two, from a suggestion by a particular gentleman that\nhe is unfriendly in his sentiments to General Washington. Richard H.\nLee, who will probably, as rumor now runs, come from Virginia, is also\nin this style. The Lees and Adamsâs have been in the habit of uniting,\nand hence may spring up a cabal very embarrassing to the Executive,\nand of course to the administration of the government. Consider\nthis,--sound the reality of it, and let me hear from you.\n\nWhat think you of Lincoln or Knox? This is a flying thought.\n\n                                             Yours, with sincere regard,\n                                             A. Hamilton.\n\nMr. Sedgewick.\n\n\n\n\nSEDGEWICK TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                    Stockbridge, Oct. 16, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nYour favor of the 9th I have this moment received, and detain the post\na while that I may make a very few observations on a subject I conceive\nhighly interesting to the efficient operations of the future Government.\n\nMr. Adams was formerly infinitely more democratical than at present,\nand possessing that jealousy which always accompanied such a\ncharacter, he was averse to repose such unlimited confidence in the\nCommander-in-chief as then was the disposition of Congress.\n\nMr. Adams is not among the number of my particular friends, but, as a\nman of unconquerable intrepidity, and of incorruptible integrity, as\ngreatly experienced in the interests and character of this country, he\npossesses my highest esteem.\n\nHis writings show that he deserves the confidence of those who wish\nenergy in government, for although those writings are too tedious\nand unpleasant in perusal, yet they are evidently the result of deep\nreflection, and as they encounter popular prejudices are an evidence of\nan erect and independent spirit.\n\nLincoln and Knox I love, their characters, too, I respect, but it is\nnow too late to push in this State the interests of either. The minds\nof all men here seem to be fixed either on Adams or Hancock.\n\nOur Legislature meet on the 29th. From Boston I will early write you on\nthe subject, and am with sincere respect,\n\n                                            Yours, affectionately,\n                                            Theodore Sedgewick.\n\nHon. Mr. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nSEDGEWICK TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                          Boston, Nov. 2, 1788.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nIn my last hasty letter I engaged to write to you soon after my arrival\nin this town. Various questions will be agitated in the Legislature\n(of considerable magnitude) which respect the organization of the\ngovernment.\n\nThere is a party of Federalists who are of opinion, that the Electors\nshould be chosen by the people, and the Representatives not in\ndistricts, but at large. These will be joined by all the antis\nprobably. I yet hope they will not succeed. We yesterday committed to a\ncommittee of both Houses the circular letter from your Convention. The\nevent is uncertain, but a considerable number of Federalists have been\nbrought over to the amendment system. The prospect is, notwithstanding,\nthat the real friends of the Constitution will prevail. Every thing\ndepends upon it, and the exertion will be proportionate to the\nmagnitude of the object.\n\nShould the Electors be chosen by the Legislature, Mr. Adams will\nprobably combine all the votes of Massachusetts. I am very certain,\nthat the suggestion that he is unfriendly to General Washington, is\nentirely unfounded. Mr. Hancock has been very explicit in patronizing\nthe doctrine of Amendment. The other gentleman is for postponing the\nconduct of that business until it shall be understood from experience.\n* * * *\n\n                                            I am, dear Sir,\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\n                                            Theodore Sedgewick.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nCOL. OLNEY TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                     Providence, 3d Nov., 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor of 6th ulto., was duly received. I thought proper to\npostpone replying to it till after the session of the General Assembly\nshould be over, which terminated on Saturday night last, in order that\nI might have it in my power to give you, with more certainty, the\nproceedings of the Legislature, on the subject of the New Constitution.\nThe minority, both in â â of the House, took unwearied pains during the\nsession, to procure a Convention in the legal mode pointed out for\nconsidering the New Constitution; but, sir, it proved, as heretofore,\nan unsuccessful attempt; for Mr. Hazard, who is an implacable and\npowerful enemy to the new system, and the leading character in all\nthe vile politics carrying on in this _devoted_ State, had so well\nprepared the majority, that when the question was put, whether this\nState should appoint a Convention or not, the question was lost nearly\nthree to one; fifteen in favor of the motion and forty-four against it.\nAfter which (late on Saturday night) Mr. Hazard moved that a vote be\npassed, for printing copies of the circular letter from the Convention\nof New-York, to be distributed throughout this State, and submitting\nto the people at large, the propriety of appointing delegates to\nmeet a _proposed_ Convention, for considering amendments, agreeably\nto the recommendations of said circular letter. The vote being put,\nafter much debate, it was carried in favor of the measure by three to\none, notwithstanding every exertion of the minority, to prevent the\nadoption of so novel and unprecedented a proceeding. It was urged,\nand with truth, that should a Convention finally meet for the purpose\nof amending the Constitution, that it would be composed entirely of\nthe adopting States; and, as such, this State could not, upon any\nprinciples of right, expect to be admitted to a seat in that Honorable\nBody, as we so obstinately (and with our eyes open) have refused,\nand still neglect to accede to the new system. But, sir, reason and\nargument will avail nothing with those wicked and designing opposers\nto a just and honorable Federal Government. The Assembly have made an\nadjournment to the last Monday in December next, in an expectation\nto hear the report from the respective towns. Mr. Hazard, and a Col.\nJohn Gardener (who is entirely under the influence of Mr. Hazardâs\npolitics), are ordered by the Assembly to go on from this State, and\ntake their seats in Congress, as soon as they can leave home; so that\nin a short time you will have those two antis to deal with.\n\n                                            I am, with sincere esteem,\n                                            Sir,\n                                            Your obedient humble servât,\n                                            Jeremiah Olney.\n\nCol. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                    Mount Vernon, Nov. 6, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Count de Moustier affording a very favorable conveyance for Capt.\nCochranâs watch, I have requested the favor of him to take charge of\nit; and he will deliver it to you, accordingly, with Mrs. Washingtonâs\nand my best wishes for you and Mrs. Hamilton.\n\n                                  I am, dear Sir,\n                                  Your obedient and affectionate servât,\n                                  G. Washington.\n\nThe Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO SEDGEWICK.\n\n\n                                        New-York, Nov. 9, 1788.\n\nYour last letter but one met me at Albany, attending court, from whence\nI am but just returned. Yours of the 2d instant is this moment handed\nme.\n\nI am very sorry for the schism you hint at among the Federalists, but\nI have so much confidence in the good management of the fast friends\nof the Constitution, that I hope no ill consequences will ensue from\nthat disagreement. It will, however, be worthy of great care to avoid\nsuffering a difference of opinion on collateral points, to produce any\nserious division between those who have hitherto drawn together on the\ngreat national question.\n\nPermit me to add, that I do not think you should allow any line to be\nrun between those who wish to trust alterations to future experience,\nand those who are desirous of them at the present juncture. The rage\nfor amendments is, in my _opinion_, rather to be parried by address\nthan encountered with open force. And I shall, therefore, be loth\nto learn that your parties have been arranged professedly upon the\ndistinction I have mentioned. The _mode_ in which amendments may best\nbe made, and twenty other matters, may serve as pretexts for avoiding\nthe evil and securing the good.\n\nOn the question between Mr. H. and Mr. A., Mr. King will probably have\ninformed you that I have, upon the whole, concluded that the latter\nought to be supported. My measures will be taken accordingly. I had but\none scruple, but after mature consideration I have relinquished it. Mr.\nAdams, to a sound understanding, has always appeared to me to add an\nardent love for the public good; and as his further knowledge of the\nworld seems to have corrected those jealousies which he is represented\nto have been once influenced by, I trust nothing of the kind suggested\nin my former letter will disturb the harmony of administration. Let me\ncontinue to hear from you, and believe me to be, with very great esteem\nand regard,\n\n                                                Your friend and servant,\n                                                A. Hamilton.\n\nT. Sedgewick, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\n\n\n                                                      November 18, 1788.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour last two letters have duly come to hand, and the Count de Moustier\nhas delivered me the watch you committed to his charge. Your obliging\nattention to this matter claims my particular acknowledgments. I will\nmake no apology for asking you to take the additional trouble of\nforwarding the inclosed to the General. I take the liberty of passing\nit through you, that you may, by perusing the contents, know the\nsituation of the business.\n\nThe demand of fifty guineas is to me quite unexpected. I am sorry to\nadd, that there is too good evidence that it cost a mere trifle to the\nGeneral. This, however, I mention in confidence. Nor shall I give you\nany further trouble on the subject. Whatever may be proper will be done.\n\nMrs. Hamilton requests her affectionate remembrances to Mrs.\nWashington, and joins me in the best wishes for you both.\n\n                                        I remain, dear Sir,\n                                        Your affectionate humble servât,\n                                        A. Hamilton.\n\nP. S. Your last letter, on a certain subject, I have received. I\nfeel a conviction that you will finally see your acceptance to be\nindispensable. It is no compliment to say, that no other man can\nsufficiently unite the public opinion, or can give the requisite\nweight to the office, in the commencement of the Government. These\nconsiderations appear to me of themselves decisive. I am not sure that\nyour refusal would not throw every thing into confusion. I am sure that\nit would have the worst effect imaginable. Indeed, as I hinted in a\nformer letter, I think circumstances leave no option.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\n\n\n                                       New-York, Nov. 23, 1788.\n\nI thank you, my dear sir, for yours of the 20th. The only part of it\nwhich surprises me, is what you mention respecting Clinton. I cannot,\nhowever, believe that the plan will succeed. Nor, indeed, do I think,\nthat Clinton would be disposed to exchange his present appointment\nfor that office, or risk his popularity by holding both. At the same\ntime, the attempt merits attention, and ought not to be neglected as\nchimerical or impracticable.\n\nIn Massachusetts the Electors will, I understand, be appointed by the\nLegislature, and will be all Federal, and âtis probable will be, for\nthe most part, in favor of Adams. It is said, the same thing will\nhappen in New Hampshire, and I have reason to believe, will be the\ncase in Connecticut. In this State it is difficult to form any certain\ncalculation. A large majority of the _Assembly_ was doubtless of an\nAnti-federal complexion, but the schism in the party which has been\noccasioned by the falling off of some of its leaders in the Convention,\nleaves me not without hope, that if matters are well managed, we may\nprocure a majority for some pretty equal compromise. In the Senate\nwe have the superiority by one. In New Jersey there seems to be no\nquestion, but that the complexion of the electors will be Federal;\nand I suppose, if thought expedient, they may be united in favor of\nAdams. Pennsylvania you can best judge of. From Delaware, Maryland, and\nSouth Carolina, I presume, we may count with tolerable assurance on\nFederal men; and I should imagine, if pains are taken, the danger of an\nAnti-federal Vice-President might itself be rendered the instrument of\nUnion. At any rate, their weight will not be thrown into the scale of\nClinton, and I do not see from what quarter numbers can be marshalled\nin his favor, equal to those who will advocate Adams, supposing even a\ndivision in the Federal votes.\n\nOn the whole, I have concluded to support Adams, though I am not\nwithout apprehensions on the score we have conversed about. My\nprincipal reasons are these: First--He is a declared partisan of\ndeferring to future experience the expediency of amendments in the\nsystem, and (although I do not altogether _adopt_ this sentiment) it\nis much nearer my own than certain other doctrines. Secondly--He is\ncertainly a character of importance in the Eastern States; if he is\nnot Vice-President, one of two worse things will be likely to happen.\nEither he must be nominated to some important office, for which he is\nless proper, or will become a malcontent, and give additional weight to\nthe opposition to the Government. As to Knox, I cannot persuade myself\nthat he will incline to the appointment. He must _sacrifice_ emolument\nby it, which must be of _necessity_ a primary object with him.\n\nIf it should be thought expedient to endeavor to unite in a particular\ncharacter, there is a danger of a different kind to which we must\nnot be inattentive--the possibility of rendering it doubtful who is\nappointed President. You know the Constitution has not provided the\nmeans of distinguishing in certain cases, and it would be disagreeable\neven to have a man treading close upon the heels of the person we\nwish as President. May not the malignity of the opposition be, in\nsome instances, exhibited even against him? Of all this we shall best\njudge, when we know who are our Electors; and we must, in our different\ncircles, take our measures accordingly.\n\nI could console myself for what you mention respecting yourself,\nfrom a desire to see you in one of the executive departments, did I\nnot perceive the representation will be defective in characters of a\ncertain description. Wilson is evidently out of the question. King\ntells me he does not believe he will be elected into either House. Mr.\nGouverneur Morris set out to-day for France, by way of Philadelphia. If\nyou are not in one of the branches, the Government may sincerely feel\nthe want of men who unite to zeal all the requisite qualifications for\nparrying the machinations of its enemies. Might I advise, it would be,\nthat you bent your course to Virginia.\n\n                                                   Affectionately yours,\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\n\nMr. J. Madison.\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                        Monday morning, January 4, 1789.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI feel myself very much obliged by what you sent me yesterday.\nThe letter from Governor Johnston I return, much pleased to find\nso authentic an account of the adoption by North Carolina of the\nConstitution.\n\n                                    Yours, sincerely and affectionately,\n                                    G. Washington.\n\n\n\n\nHAMILTON TO SEDGEWICK.\n\n\n                                       New-York, Jan. 29, 1789.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI thank you for your two letters of the 4th and 7th instant, which\narrived here during my absence at Albany, from which place I have but\nrecently returned. I believe you may be perfectly tranquil on the\nsubject of Mr. Adamsâs election. It seems to be certain that all the\nMiddle States will vote for him to Delaware inclusively, and probably\nMaryland. In the South, there are no candidates thought of but Rutledge\nand Clinton. The latter will have the votes of Virginia, and it is\n_possible_ some in South Carolina. Maryland will certainly not vote for\nClinton, and New-York, from our Legislature having by their contentions\nlet slip the day, will not vote at all. For the last circumstance, I\nam not sorry, as the most we could hope would be to balance accounts\nand do no harm. The Anti-federalists incline to an appointment\nnotwithstanding, but I discourage it with the Federalists. Under these\ncircumstances, I see not how any person can come near Mr. Adams; that\nis, taking it for granted that he will unite the votes in New Hampshire\nand Massachusetts. I expect that the Federal votes in Virginia, if any,\nwill be in favor of Adams.\n\nYou will probably have heard that our Legislature has passed a bill\nfor electing Representatives. The houses continue to disagree about\nSenators, and I fear a compromise will be impracticable. I do not,\nhowever, entirely lose hope. In this situation, you will perceive\nthat we have much to apprehend respecting the seat of Government.\nThe Pennsylvanians are endeavoring to bring their forces early in\nthe field. I hope our friends in the North will not be behindhand.\nOn many accounts, indeed, it appears to be important that there be\nan appearance of zeal and punctuality in coming forward to set the\nGovernment in motion.\n\nI shall learn with infinite pleasure that you are a Representative. As\nto me, this will not be the case--I believe, from my own disinclination\nto the thing. We shall, however, I flatter myself, have a couple of\nFederalists.\n\n                                I remain your affectionate and obedient,\n                                A. Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\nWADSWORTH TO HAMILTON.\n\n\n                                      Hartford, February, 1789.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nYour favor of the 25th January came in good time. Our votes were given\nagreeably to your wishes--Washington, 7; Adams, 5; Governor Huntington,\n2. By letters from Carrington, I learn that Clinton is the Anti-federal\nVice-president; but I think we have nothing to fear. I believe New\nHampshire will give Adams 4; Massachusetts, 6; Georgia, 6--as letters\nfrom Georgia say he will have at least so many--which, with ours,\nmakes 21, which is more than Clinton can get, and we may certainly\nreckon on three more for Adams in South Carolina, Maryland, Delaware,\nPennsylvania, and New Jersey. We waived an answer to your State, and to\nVirginia. As you did not get my letter in season to answer me on that\nsubject, I feared we should not do any good by an answer; and as the\nAnti-federalists did not move it, I thought we had best let it sleep.\n* * *\n\n                                            I am, dear sir,\n                                            Your affectionate friend,\n                                            Jeremiah Wadsworth.\n\n\n\n\nEND OF VOL.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future\ngenerations.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.

Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n",

whom taught believe excellent post, least checking retarding burgoyneâs progress. agree principal strength quarter are, forests natural strength country, want forage, provisions, carriages, &c., which enemy easily thrown, taking away there articles, which, observe, never great abundance. doubtful whether burgoyne attempt penetrate far, whether not content himself harassing back settlements parties assisted savages, who, feared, pretty generally tempted, enemyâs late successes, confederate hostilities against us. doubt arises some appearances indicate southern movement general howeâs army, which, really happen, certainly barrier against any further impressions burgoyne; cannot supposed rash enough plunge into bosom country without expectation met general howe. things prove very adverse indeed, make such attempt _not ruined it._ confess, however, appearances allude not carry full evidence mind; because opposed others contradictory kind; because cannot conceive upon principle common sense, military propriety, howe running away burgoyne southward. much wished may, even though give him possession philadelphia, which remoteness it, very well happen. case, not only, think proper, retaliate, aiming stroke new-york; come upon him greatest part collective force, act against part which under him. then certain burgoyne cannot proceed, small force continental troops sufficient partisan war which carry rest campaign. small force also sufficient garrison posts highlands, prevent any danger there; able bring nearly whole continental army against mr. howe. advantages obvious. satisfied splendor acquisition, shut himself up philadelphia, ruin him confinement. leave garrison there, go forward, either fall upon main body, diminished such measure, whole force. there will, however, many disagreeable consequences attending such event; amongst which, foremost is, _depreciation currency_, which, importance which philadelphia held, cannot fail ensue. am, dear sir, most obedient servant, alex. hamilton. hamilton dr. knox. event [the evacuation ticonderoga[1]], redounds very little credit. post untenable, required larger number troops defend than spared purpose, long ago foreseen given up. instead that, kept large quantity cannon it, heaping up very valuable magazines stores provisions, that, critical moment defence, abandoned lost. affair attended several evil consequences; besides loss stores, which cannot well afford, opens new easy door which penetrate northern states. fix hitherto fluctuating disposition indians quarter favor, expose frontiers adjacent country depredations. though misfortune reason lament, dare say regarded much more important than really is, materially endangering success cause, which means case. opposition time too well matured, too great stability, shaken accident kind. while respectable army field, resources feed, clothe, arm them, safe. force sufficient foregoing part campaign, maintain such superiority over main army enemy effectually hinder attaining any purposes. and, northward, reinforcements sent up succor retreating garrison ticonderoga, militia flocking new england, think there little doubt time force adequate give mr. burgoyne seasonable check. one good effect result misfortune, which is, stimulate eastern states greater exertions than otherwise make. last advices, enemy possession all country between ticonderoga fort george; army, nearly equal number them, about take post somewhere between fort edward saratoga. consequences northern affair depend much upon part howe acts. co-operate burgoyne, demand utmost efforts counteract them. go towards southward, all most advantages burgoyneâs success lost. either obliged content himself possession ticonderoga, dependent fortresses, carrying partisan war rest campaign; precipitate himself into certain ruin, attempting advance into country very incompetent force. appearances lead suppose howe fool enough meditate southern expedition; now altered station staten island, mentioned above, fallen down hook. judging morally certain there co-operation two armies, thought expedient march northerly; accordingly reached within fourteen miles new windsor, place cross north river without danger interruption. new movement enemyâs fleet, induced return few miles, make disposition marching southerly. shall, however, cautious proceed course, lest nothing more than feint intended, divert real object. go southward earnest, capture philadelphia view; there other inducement. endeavor get there time oppose them; principal part continental force, large body spirited militia, many them, services during last campaign, pretty well inured arms, make opposition with. yet not much surprised philadelphia fall; enemy doubtless go there determination succeed all hazard; not able prevent them, without risking general action, expediency which depend upon circumstances. militia turn out zeal right expect, conduct enemy made last experiment jersies, supposed going philadelphia, without much inconvenience. fall materially short it, obliged confine ourselves skirmishing opposition, which cannot expect effectual. asked, if, avoid general engagement, give up objects first importance, hinder enemy carrying every important point, ruining us? answer is, hopes not placed any particular city spot ground, preserving good army, furnished proper necessaries, take advantage favorable opportunities, waste defeat enemy piecemeal. every new post take, requires new division forces, enables strike united force against part theirs: such present situation, another trenton affair amount complete victory part; too low ebb bear another stroke kind. perhaps, before opportunity sending this, facts unfold now endeavoring anticipate conjecture. expect some animadversions temper views french nation. presume nearly well acquainted assistance giving am, both intrigues foreign courts, supplies every kind warlike stores apparatus. not admit doubt interested wish success; conduct plainly shows, willing give every aid essential preservation. natural desire much convenience themselves can. apprehend not over fond plunging themselves into war england avoid it, still answer end pursue: and, indeed, evident reluctance shown part latter, any thing bring about such event, becomes extremely difficult draw into it. conclusion make, is, france not wish force england into war, unless finds affairs require absolutely; england not enter into one, till compelled it. best respects all friends; beg believe be, unabated regard, dear sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. [1] july 5, 1777. hamilton president congress. sept. 18, 1777. sir: congress not left philadelphia, immediately without fail; enemy means throwing party night into city. just now passed valley ford--in which party enemy came down fired upon boat, which means lost horse--one man killed, another wounded. boats abandoned, fall into hands. all prevent this, purpose. honor be, much respect, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. hon. john hancock. honorable john hancock, president congress. september 18, 1777, 9 oâclock night. sir: myself honor write hasty line evening, giving opinion, city longer place safety you. write again, lest letter not get hand. enemy road swedes ford, main body about four miles it. sent party evening daviserâs ferry, which fired upon some others crossing it, killed one man, wounded another, disabled horse. came suddenly, one boat left adrift other side, which course fall into hands; and, help that, get possession another, which abandoned who direction it, left afloat, spite every thing contrary. two boats convey fifty men across time, few hours throw over large party, perhaps sufficient overmatch militia who between city. renders situation congress extremely precarious, not guard: apprehensions great, though not improbable not realized. most cogent reasons oblige join army night, waited upon myself. hopes army up enemy before pass schuylkill: are, something serious ensue. honor be, much respect, sir, most obedient, a. hamilton. hamilton president congress. philadelphia, 22d september, 1777. sir: left camp last evening, came city superintend collection blankets clothing army. mr. lovell sends inform there express going off congress; myself honor communicate brief state things left camp. enemy moved yesterday, lay opposite valley forge, &c., higher up river, old scheme gaining right. donât know precisely halted; army preparing move up also, counteract them. morning told, marched about twelve oâclock night purpose. general opinion was, enemy attempt crossing day: every appearance justified supposition. intelligence enemy had, night before last, surprised generals smallwood wayne, consequently dispersed them, after small opposition. loss, said, not great: troops re-assembling fast red lion. seems bad look out, somewhat disconcerting. letter general mcdougal, received morning, appears was, twentieth, morning, second river, just setting out march toward woodbridge. pressing forward all possible expedition. troops pretty well refreshed, good spirits. have, &c., a. hamilton. washington hamilton. head quarters, philadelphia county, 30th oct., 1777. dear sir: judged expedient members council war, held yesterday, one gentlemen family sent general gates, order lay before him state army, situation enemy;

measure will, all probability, reduce general howe same situation which general burgoyne now is, attempt remain philadelphia without able remove obstructions delaware, open free communication shipping. force which members council war judge safe expedient draw down present, three new hampshire fifteen massachusetts regiments, leeâs jacksonâs two sixteen, additional. more than probable general gates detained part troops reduction ticonderoga, enemy not evacuated it; garrisoning it. should, case reinforcement according circumstances; but, possible, let made up same number out other corps. if, upon meeting general gates, find intends, consequence success, employ troops under command upon some expedition, prosecution which common cause more benefited than sent down reinforce army, not wish give any interruption plan. nothing more contemplation than particular objects which mentioned you, which unnecessary commit paper; case inform him, desire reinforcements before mentioned, such parts safely spared, immediately put motion join army. understood general gates already detached nixonâs gloverâs brigades join general putnam; general dickinson informs me, sir henry clinton come down river whole force: fact, desire general putnam send two brigades forward greatest expedition, there occasion there. expect meet colonel morganâs corps upon way down: do, let know essential services us; desire colonel commanding officer, hasten march much consistent health men after late fatigues. g. w. p.s. ordered detachment belonging general mcdougalâs division come forward. meet them, direct belonging greeneâs, angelâs, chandlerâs, duryeeâs regiments, not cross delaware, proceed red bank. hamilton washington. fishkill, nov. 2, 1777. dear sir: lodged last night neighborhood new windsor. morning early met colonel morgan corps, about mile it, march head quarters. told him necessity making all dispatch could, not fatigue men too much, which promised do. understood colonel morgan, all northern army marching down both sides river, would, probably, to-morrow new windsor place; general putnam held council general disposition them, which resolved send four thousand men, keep rest side river. came here expectation matters such train enable accomplish errand without going any further, unless hasten troops march: arrival, learned mr. hughes, aid-de-camp general gates, following disposition northern army taken place. general pattersonâs, gloverâs, nixonâs brigades, colonel warnerâs mountain boys, remain about albany: barracks building them. general poorâs brigade, marching down side river join general putnam, here probably to-morrow. general learnedâs brigade, morganâs corps, warnerâs brigade massachusetts militia, some regiments new-york militia, march west side river. directed general putnam, name, send forward, all dispatch, join you, two continental brigades, warnerâs militia brigade: last serve till latter end month. instructions not comprehend any militia: there certain accounts here, most troops new-york gone reinforce general howe; large proportion continental troops detained albany; concluded not disapprove measure calculated strengthen you, though small time, ventured adopt presumption. informed general putnam, general wynds, seven hundred jersey militia, kingâs ferry, intention cross peekskill, prevailed upon him relinquish idea, send off immediate order march towards red bank. possible, however, unless excellency supports order application yourself, march men home, instead marching place directed repair to. neither leeâs, jacksonâs regiments, nor detachments belonging general mcdougalâs division, yet marched. urged sent; order dispatched instantly proceeding. colonel hughes pressing some fresh horses me. moment ready, recross river, order fall troops other side, make all haste albany, get three brigades there sent forward. excellency permit observe, some doubts, under present circumstances appearances, propriety leaving regiments proposed left quarter? doubts subject stronger than are, forbid, sense council, interfering matter. general poorâs brigade just arrived here: proceed join all expedition. strongly impressed importance endeavoring crush mr. howe, apt think advisable draw off all continental troops. determined on, general warnerâs sixteen hundred militia left here. honor be, warmest esteem respect, excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. hamilton washington. albany, november, 1777. dear sir: arrived here yesterday noon, waited upon general gates immediately, business mission; sorry find ideas not correspond yours, drawing off number troops directed. used every argument power, convince him propriety measure; inflexible opinion, two brigades, least, continental troops, remain near place. reasons were, intelligence sir henry clintonâs gone join howe, not sufficiently authenticated put out doubt; there was, therefore, possibility returning up river, which expose finest arsenal america (as calls one here) destruction, place left bare troops proposed; want conveniencies, difficulty roads, make impossible remove artillery stores considerable time; new england states left open depredations ravages enemy; put out power enterprise any thing against ticonderoga, which thinks done winter, which considers importance undertake. force reasons means strike me; every thing power show unsubstantial: all effect, one brigade dispatched, addition already marched. found myself infinitely embarrassed, loss act. felt importance strengthening much possible: but, other hand, found insuperable inconveniences, acting diametrically opposite opinion gentleman, whose successes raised him highest importance. general gates won entire confidence eastern states. disposed it, addressing himself prejudices people, find difficulty render measure odious, which said, plausibility enough believed, calculated expose unnecessary dangers, notwithstanding exertions, during campaign, given fullest title repose security. general gates influence interest elsewhere: use it, pleased, discredit measure there also. whole, appeared dangerous, insist sending more troops hence, while general gates appeared warmly opposed it. any accident, inconvenience, happen consequence it, there too fair pretext censure: many people too well disposed lay hold it. any rate, considered using him ill, take step contrary judgment, case nature. considerations, others which more explicit pleasure seeing you, determined not insist upon sending either other brigades remaining here. afraid done, not meet approbation, not perhaps fully warranted instructions: ventured thought right, hoping that, least, goodness intention excuse error judgment. induced relaxation more readily, directed sent on, two thousand militia, which not expected you; thousand continental troops out proposed left general putnam, which written him, since found matters circumstanced here, forward all dispatch. several reasons: because reinforcement more expeditious place than this: because two thousand continental troops peekskill not wanted present circumstances; especially really necessary body continental troops place, security valuable stores here: not, wish, think expedient draw off more than two three brigades now here. case, one ends proposed answered, leaving ten regiments general putnam, equally answered troops here; mean covering fortifying eastern states: one thousand continental troops addition militia collected, collected, here, sufficient, highlands, covering country down way, carrying works necessary raised defence river. troops gone, going, reinforce you, near five thousand rank file, continental troops; two thousand five hundred massachusetts new hampshire militia. seven hundred jersey militia, larger reinforcement than expected, though not quite equal number continental troops; nor exactly way directed. general lincoln tells me, militia very excellent; though time out last month, able, think proper, order troops still remaining here, join time term service expires. cannot forbear uneasy, lest conduct prove displeasing you: done what, considering all circumstances, appeared most eligible prudent. vessels preparing carry brigade new windsor, which embark evening. shall, afternoon, set out return camp; way, endeavor hasten troops forward. honor be, great esteem respect, excellencyâs most obât, alex. hamilton. hamilton gates. albany, november 5, 1777. sir: inquiry, learned general pattersonâs brigade, which one propose send, far weakest three now here, not consist more than about six hundred rank file fit duty. true, there militia regiment about two hundred; time service which regiment engaged, near expiring, past time men arrive destination. under circumstances, cannot consider either compatible good service, instructions excellency general washington, consent brigade selected three go him; under necessity desiring, virtue orders him, one others substituted instead this; either general nixonâs, general gloverâs; pleased give immediate orders embarkation. knowing general washington wished pay greatest deference judgment, ventured far deviate instructions gave me, consent, compliance opinion, two brigades remain here instead one. same time permit observe, not myself sensible expediency keeping more than one, detached regiments neighborhood place; ideas coincide gentlemen whom consulted occasion, whose judgment much more reliance upon than own, who supposed thorough knowledge all circumstances. opinion is, one brigade, regiments before mentioned, amply answer purposes post. preferred opinion other considerations, not imagine pitch upon brigade little more than half large others: finding case, indispensably owe duty, desire, excellencyâs name, another go instead one intended, without loss time. conducive dispatch, send gloverâs brigade, agreeable you, give orders accordingly. honor be, real respect esteem, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. general gates. hamilton washington. new windsor, november 10th, 1777. dear sir: arrived here last night albany. given general gates little time recollect himself, renewed remonstrances necessity propriety sending more than one brigade three detained him; finally prevailed upon him give orders gloverâs addition pattersonâs brigade, march way. thought conducive expedition, send troops water, far done, procured all vessels albany, fit purpose; not get more than sufficient take pattersonâs brigade. embarked seventh instant; wind contrary: probably here to-day. general gloverâs brigade marched same time, east side river, roads much better than side. moment informed, one sloop, part pattersonâs, arrived, others sight. immediately proceed, water, kingâs ferry, thence take shortest route. pained beyond expression inform excellency, arrival here, find every thing neglected deranged general putnam; two brigades, poorâs learnedâs, still remain here other side river fishkill. colonel warnerâs militia, told, drawn peekskill, aid expedition against new-york, which, seems, is, time, hobby-horse general putnam. not least attention paid order, name, detachment one thousand men troops hitherto stationed post. every thing sacrificed whim taking new-york. two brigades poor learned, appears, not march want money necessaries; several regiments received pay six eight months past. there high mutiny among former account, which captain killed man, himself shot comrade. difficulties, want proper management, stopped troops proceeding. governor clinton only man who done any thing towards removing them; want general putnamâs co-operation, not able effect it. only able prevail learnedâs brigade, agree march goshen; hopes, getting once go, induce continue march. coming here, immediately sent colonel bailey, who now commands learnedâs brigade, persuaded him engage carry brigade head quarters fast possible. expects effect means five six thousand dollars, which governor clinton kind enough borrow me, which colonel bailey thinks keep men good humor till join you. marched morning towards goshen. shall, soon possible, see general poor, every thing power get him along; hope able succeed. plan before laid, totally deranged, new one become necessary. now too late send warnerâs militia; time reached you, term service out. motive sending them, which give speedy reinforcement, has, past delay, superseded. governor clintonâs advice, sent order, most emphatical terms, general putnam, immediately dispatch all continental troops under him assistance; detain militia instead them. opinion is, only present use troops quarter, is, protect country depredations little plundering parties; carrying works necessary defence river. nothing more thought of. âtis only wasting time, misapplying men, employ suicidal parade against new-york: undoubtedly terminate. new-york object, taken: take it, require more men than spared more substantial purposes. governor clintonâs ideas coincide mine. thinks there more continental troops here, than few give spur militia working upon fortifications. pursuance given directions before mentioned. general putnam attends them, troops under him nearly early any others (though has, unluckily, marched down tarrytown); general gloverâs brigade, gets up, more than sufficient answer true end post. excellency agrees opinion, well send instant directions general putnam, pursue object mentioned: doubt whether attend any thing say, notwithstanding comes shape positive order. fear, unless interpose, works here go feebly, want men, not completed time: whereas, appears greatest importance pushed utmost vigor. governor clinton every thing power. wish general putnam recalled command post, governor clinton accept it: blunders caprices former endless. believe me, sir, nobody more impressed importance forwarding reinforcements coming you, all speed; nor any body endeavored promote more than done: _ignorance_ some, _design_ others, almost insuperable obstacles. very unwell; not spare myself get things immediately proper train; purpose intend, unless receive other orders you, continue troops progress march. soon get general poorâs brigade march, proceed general putnamâs peekskill. have, &c., alex. hamilton. excellency, general washington. hamilton washington. new windsor, november 12, 1777. dear sir: detained here two days fever, violent rheumatic pains throughout body. prevented active, person, promoting purposes errand;

believe past delay not owing any fault his, wholly chargeable general putnam. indeed, sir, owe service say, every part gentlemanâs conduct marked blunder negligence, gives general disgust. parsonsâ brigade join you, hope, five six days this. learnedâs same. poorâs will, persuaded, make all haste future. gloverâs expected fishkill to-night; whence pressed forward fast any influence make go. sorry say, disposition marching, officers men general, troops, not keep pace wishes, exigency occasion. have, unfortunately, imbibed idea, done part business campaign, now entitled repose. this, want pay, make averse long march advanced season. letter general putnam, just now received governor clinton, appears been, 10th instant, kingâs street, white plains. answer last applications. enemy appear stripped new-york very bare. people there, is, tories, great fright: adds anxiety, reinforcements quarter not greater forwardness more considerable. written general gates, informing him accounts situation new-york respect troops, probability force gone howe greater than first expected; try not _extort_ him further reinforcement. donât, however, expect much him; pretends view expedition against ticonderoga, undertaken winter: knows that, under sanction idea, calculated catch eastern people, may, without censure, retain troops. under necessity speaking plainly excellency, pleasure seeing you, not hesitate say, doubt whether man northern army, whole kept albany any decency. perhaps think blamable not exercised powers gave me, given positive order. perhaps so: but, deliberately weighing all circumstances, not, not, think advisable it. honor be, unfeigned esteem regard, excellencyâs most obât servant, a. hamilton. excellency general washington. hamilton gates. fishkill, november 12, 1777. sir: ever since arrival quarter, endeavoring collect best idea state things new-york, order better form judgment probable reinforcement gone general howe. whole, fact well ascertained, new-york stripped bare possible: consequence this, few troops there, inhabitants, under strong apprehensions attack, almost amount _panic_;

each colonel regiment: each general particular command: commander-in-chief whole. began letter, not intend meddle any other subject than inspectorship; one just comes into head which appears small importance. goodness, force, army, depends much, perhaps more, composition corps which form it, collective number. composition good bad, not only according quality men, proportion completeness incompleteness corps respect numbers. regiment, instance, full complement officers, fifty sixty men, not half good company same number men. colonel look upon such command unworthy ambition, neglect despise it: captain pride himself it, take all pains power bring perfection. one case see total relaxation discipline, negligence every thing constitutes military excellence: other, there attention, energy, every thing wished. opinion, whether well ill-founded, governing principle human affairs. corps much below establishment, comparing be, loses all confidence itself; whole army loses confidence emulation which essential success. these, thousand other things occur you, make evident, most important advantages attend complete corps, proportional disadvantages reverse. ten thousand men, distributed into twenty imperfect regiments, not efficiency same number half number regiments. fact is, respect american army, want discipline, other defects labor under, much owing skeleton state regiments any other cause. then? any prospect filling regiments? opinion is, nearly arrived _ne plus ultra_. so, reduce number corps, give substance consistency which want, incorporating together, bring near establishment. measure army infinitely improved; state saved expense maintaining number superfluous officers. present condition regiments, incapable even performing common exercises without joining two more together: expedient reluctantly submitted officers who see themselves made second command battalion, instead first, commission imports; which happens every younger colonel whose regiment united elder. inconveniencies, while officers who remain command, who selected others account superior merit, applaud themselves preference given them, rejoice change which confers such additional consequence themselves? who excluded measure, return home discontented, make noise, which soon subside forgotten among matters greater moment. quiet still more effectually, thought necessary, put upon half-pay certain time. if, considering matter, agree sentiment, wished scheme immediately adopted, while arrangement now hand still unexecuted. made, rather inconvenient, immediately after, unhinge throw whole system again afloat. determined last arrangement, not know success different states draughting recruiting. then improper reduce number corps, proposed. now seen success: prospect seeing regiments filled;

heureusement que je viens de lâattraper, car Ã  force de courir je suis arrivÃ© Ã  temps pour lâÃ©vacuation dont il voulait encore priver. le malheur de ne pas Ãªtre Ã  la premiÃ¨re affaire mâa fait la peine la plus vive, et je ne mâen consolerai jamais, quoique ce soit bien loin dâÃªtre ma faute. les deux retraites font honneur aux troupes et au gÃ©nÃ©ral sullivan, qui sây est conduit parfaitement, elles en font rue aux anglais et Ã  leur gÃ©nÃ©raux qui nâont montrÃ© ni activitÃ©, ni gÃ©nie, du moins Ã  ce quâil paraÃ®t. le malheureux mr. tousard eu le bras emportÃ© au milieu dâune des actions les plus valeureuses qui ait Ã©tÃ© faite. câest un homme aussi brave quâil est honnÃªte. je crains dâembarrasser le gÃ©nÃ©ral en lui mandant ce que je voudrais quâon fÃ®t pour lui; mais la commission de major ne pouvait-elle pas se changer en celle de lieutenant colonel; il avait fait un arrangement avant de partir _le grand arrangement de mr. du coudray_, oÃ¹ en cas de la perte dâun membre, ils devaient avoir une pension de tant, cet arrangement-lÃ  qui comme vous savez nâa pas Ã©tÃ© acceptÃ©, ne pouvait-il pas se renouveler en sa faveur. il faut que vous rendiez un grand service;

every one, partiality own ideas, wishes convey who charged management affairs. channel public papers, commonly made use purpose, appears exceptionable several accounts. not only restrains freedom discussion, extreme delicacy subject; discussion itself increases evil, exposing weak sides popular eye, adding false terrors well-founded apprehensions which situation authorizes. instead pursuing method, prefer addressing myself member body, whose power alone is, well-digested system, extricate embarrassments. pitched upon you, personal knowledge abilities zeal. offer any thing new useful, persuaded endeavor turn advantage. contrary case, am, least, harm. only trouble writing, reading, few useless pages. object principal concern state currency. opinion, all speculations head founded error. most people think, depreciation avoided, provident arrangements beginning, without any aid abroad: great many sanguine politicians, till very lately, imagined money still restored expedients within ourselves. hence delay attempting procure foreign loan. idea proceeded ignorance real extent resources. war, particularly first periods, required exertions beyond strength, which neither population nor riches equal. fullest proof this, constant thinness armies; impossibility, time, recruiting otherwise than compulsion; scarcity hands husbandry, other occupations; decrease staple commodities; difficulty every species supply. aware badness money influence; originally effect, not cause, though now partakes nature both. part evils appear, finances more flourishing condition. experienced before money materially depreciated; contributed depreciation. want men soon obliged public pay extravagant wages every department. agriculture languished defect hands. mechanic arts same. price every kind labor increased: articles foreign commerce, interruption received, more than kept pace other things. relative value money determined greater less portion labor commodities which purchase; whatever gained price, course lost value. public expenditures, dearness every thing, necessarily became immense; greater proportion than other countries; much beyond any revenues which best concerted scheme finance extracted natural funds state. taxes, which people capable bearing, quantity money which deemed proper medium country (had gold instead paper), sufficient current exigencies government. most opulent states europe, war any duration, commonly obliged recourse foreign loans subsidies.[3] how, then, expect without them, not augment quantity artificial wealth beyond bounds which proper preserve credit? idea chimerical. quantity money formerly circulation among us, estimated about thirty millions dollars. barely sufficient interior commerce. exterior commerce chiefly carried barter. sent commodities abroad, brought back others return. balance principal branch against us; little _specie_ derived others, transferred directly payment balance, without passing into home circulation. impracticable, loans taxes, bring such portion forementioned sum into public coffers answered purposes war: nor spared considerable part, without obstructing operations domestic commerce. taxes limited, not only quantity wealth state, temper, habits, genius people; all which, country, conspired render moderate: loans, men not prevailed upon lend money public there scarcity, find more profitable way employing otherwise, case. ordinary revenues united provinces amount about twenty-five millions guilders; two millions two hundred fifty thousand pounds sterling per annum. is, proportion territory numbers, richest country world; country people sustain heaviest load taxes. population about equal ours, two millions souls. burthens subject great, some held almost impracticable, even extraordinary emergencies, enlarge revenues new impositions. maintained, dependence, cases, extraordinary contributions wealthy individuals; aid which, some wars, raised four millions sterling year. country possessed vast stock wealth, taxes carried such height; means paying infinitely exceed power; national revenues only amount sum stated, inadequate product any taxes levied, demands service! loans, reason before hinted, out question; least, trifling object little importance. suppose able raise million sterling, annually; sum probably exceeded ability; unequal wants![4] economy made bear any proportion, especially recur causes already enumerated, which currency depreciated first stages. reasonings results, not power congress, emissions arrived thirty millions dollars, put stop them.[5] obliged, order keep up supplies, go creating artificial revenues new emissions; multiplied, value declined. progress depreciation retarded, not prevented. was, great degree, necessary. there one remedy; foreign loan. all other expedients rather considered auxiliary. loan obtained, judiciously applied, assisted vigorous system taxation, avoided excess emissions which ruined paper. credit such fund procured loans moneyed trading men within ourselves; because directed, beneficial commercial transactions abroad.[6] necessity foreign loan now greater than ever. nothing else retrieve affairs. wheels government, without it, cannot much longer kept motion. including loan-office certificates, state emissions, about four hundred millions dollars circulation. real value these, less than seven millions, which true circulating medium states: though price specie rate exchange sterling bills nominal value every commodity least sixty one, average. all reasonings against possibility raising current expenses foundation thirty millions, apply present situation ratio thirty seven; is, thirty seven less practicable now than emissions amounted only thirty millions. every dollar circulation brought annually into treasury, which never effected any country, politically impossible, revenue not equal yearly expense. hope appreciating money, taxes domestic loans, end. fast received, issued daily expenditures. momentary interval between drawn out circulation returning into it, prevent receiving least advantage. reasonings appear useless, necessity foreign loan now acknowledged, measures taking procure it. intended establish good principles; want which brought desperate crisis arrived at, still betray into fatal mistakes. loan employed, now question; difficulty equal importance! two plans proposed: one, purchase up once, specie, sterling bills, all superfluous paper; endeavor, taxes, loans, economy, hinder returning into circulation. remainder, supposed, then recover value. this, said, reduce public debt sterling cost paper. suppose two hundred millions purchased, rest called taxes. require bills amount dollars. doubt whether four times sum sufficient. moment known such purchases made, avarice speculators begin operate: demand immediately occasion artificial appreciation; each successive million cost more than preceding. appreciation more relative purchasing medium than prices commodities. raising value paper relative former, depend combination few artful individuals, easily accomplished. diminution prices slow, implies change sentiments body people respect money. sudden revolution general rates all necessaries life not expected. prices these, reached present summit degrees, must, degrees, revert former station. minds people not readily admit impressions favor currency. all past experience given habit diffidence; epidemical spirit extortion maintain violent struggle whatever tendency produce fall prices. permanent reduction quantity circulating cash, alone gradually effect it. not happen present plan. necessity continuing supplies nearly same rates now given (which case reasonings true), nearly same effect mentioned respect taxes domestic loans. money return into circulation almost fast drawn out: end year find treasury empty; foreign loan dissipated; state finances deplorable ever. moderate calculation, spent ten twelve millions real dollars, sole purpose carrying war another year. much better, instead purchasing up paper currency, purchase supplies out specie bills. first instance, public suffer direct loss artificial appreciation, relative purchasing medium: last, buy value commodities specie bills. great source error disquisitions nature, judging events abstract calculations; which, though geometrically true, false relate concerns beings governed more passion prejudice, than enlightened sense interests. degree illusion mixes itself all affairs society. opinion objects more influence than real nature. quantity money circulation certainly chief cause decline: find depreciated more than five times much rule. excess derived opinion; want confidence. like manner deceive ourselves, suppose value increase proportion quantity lessened. opinion operate here also; thousand circumstances promote counteract principle. other plan proposed, convert loan into merchandise, import public account. plan incomparably better than former. instead losing sale specie bills, public gain considerable profit commodities imported. loan go much further way, supplying expenses war; large stock valuable commodities, useful army country, introduced. affect prices things general, assist currency. arts monopolizers prevent extensive durable influence have. great impediment success this, well former scheme, vast sums requisite current expenses. arguments adduced former case applicable here also, though not equal force. necessity public under parting stock defray daily demands, give designing men opportunity, combinations not purchase, oblige sell rate below real value money. more easily effect, demand foreign commodities much less than formerly, account general spirit parsimony which obtained necessity, manufactures carried private families own use. greatest part country people now almost entirely clothe themselves. public either sell very cheap, collect rapidly superfluous paper hopes raising value remainder; sell very slow, preserve due proportion between articles sale wants buy. pursuing first method, soon exhaust stock very considerable loss, only give temporary relief currency. according principle, though sells cheap, still buy dear; and, consequently, money collected cannot remain treasury long enough preserve rise appreciated state. pursues second method, expenditures equal income; though public make natural profits goods, lay up nothing, nothing towards appreciation.[7] farmers game own hands, make very difficult lower prices commodities. want laborers, there great superfluity most essential articles raised. things absolute necessity, purchased, well other classes society public. farmers, contrary, not like price, not obliged sell; because almost every necessary within themselves; salt, one two more, excepted; which bear small proportion wanted them; which obtain, barter, other articles equally indispensable. heavy taxes, said, oblige sell; pay, small part have, any taxes legislatures venture impose, able enforce. one measure, alone, counterbalance advantages farmers, oblige contribute proper quota support government: tax kind. instantly begin throughout states. present quantity cash, though nominally enormous, would, reality, found incompetent domestic circulation, not great part internal commerce carried barter. reason, impossible, pecuniary taxes, raise sum proportioned wants state. money longer general representative; ceases so, state call portion thing represented; or, other words, tax kind. greatly facilitate whatever plan finance adopted; because lessen expenditures cash, make easier retain drawn in. said demand foreign goods less than formerly was. mean there not demand large quantity, which reasons already assigned clearly demonstrate; nor exorbitant rates now given any objection doctrine. there absolute scarcity even comparison present consumption; and, course, demand there is. importation two millions sterling take place, market glutted; there way keeping up price, making very slow sales. less quantity stand chance calling money, keeping long enough effect any thing favor credit. say nothing about risk importation. not believe obtain convoy sufficient justify hazarding without precaution insurance. expedient safe; satisfied smaller profits sake security. plan not altogether rejected. prudent management enable carry war two three years (which, perhaps, long last); expect more it, restoration currency, disappointed. only plan preserve currency, one make _immediate_ interest moneyed men co-operate government support. country same predicament which france previous famous mississippi scheme, projected mr. law. paper money, like ours, dwindled nothing; efforts government revive it, because people lost all confidence ability. mr. law, who much more penetration than integrity, readily perceived, plan succeed which not unite interest credit rich individuals state; upon this, framed idea project, which, far, agreed principle bank england. foundation good, superstructure too vast. proprietors aimed unlimited wealth, government itself expected too much; which cause ultimate miscarriage scheme, all mischiefs befel kingdom consequence. wisdom select good plan, any others gone before us;

je suis aussi trÃ¨s fÃ¢chÃ© de nâavoir pas su tout cela dans le temps pour vous le mander. car il Ã©tait encore temps alors dâaller dans le sud; maintenant je ne sais plus que dÃ©sirer. cependant hier lâon nous dÃ©bitait que des vaisseaux de transport servant de vaisseaux de guerre Ã©taient arrivÃ©s Ã  new-york pour prendre des renforts; si cela Ã©tait si confirmÃ©, il nây aurait apparence que les anglais ne se proposaient pas de commencer leurs opÃ©rations avant lâarrivÃ©e de ces renforts, alors ce serait peut Ãªtre le cas dây aller. je laisse tout cela Ã  faire Ã  votre prudence, et Ã  votre amitiÃ©, vous savez une partie des raisons que jâai toujours eu et que jâai encore de ne point faire de demande Ã  ce sujet au gÃ©nÃ©ral washington, mais vous savez aussi combien je dÃ©sire dâaller en caroline. sâil y quelque apparence que je puisse y arriver Ã  temps, je ne vois pas dâinconvÃ©nient Ã  ce que vous faisiez usage auprÃ¨s du gÃ©neral de ce qui sâest passÃ© dans le congrÃ¨s, parce que plusieurs membres de congrÃ¨s lâont dÃ©jÃ  dit Ã  diffÃ©rentes personnes. (si vous voulez ensuite que je vous parle comme Ã  mon ami, je vous dirai que jâai eu lieu de voir que de mâenvoyer lÃ  bas, aurait fait un fort bon effet ici, surtout dans le commencement.) supposez donc, que notre gÃ©neral jugeÃ¢t par des circonstances ultÃ©rieures quâil peut encore Ãªtre temps de mây envoyer, comme il ne faut pas perdre un moment, il serait bon que je ne fusse pas obligÃ© de retourner au camp. pour cela il faudrait mâenvoyer avec les ordres, toutes les lettres nÃ©cessaires pour le gÃ©neral lincoln et autres. vous savez, mon cher colonel, ce que je dÃ©sire Ã  cet Ã©gard. si je vais lÃ -bas, il faut que mon arrivÃ©e soit comme un de ces accidents au thÃ©Ã¢tre qui rÃ©veille les spectateurs, et redonne de lâactivitÃ© et de la chaleur Ã  la piÃ¨ce, vous mâentendez. je crois que dans ce cas le gÃ©nÃ©ral doit Ã©crire au congrÃ¨s, outre les raisons quâil de mâenvoyer pour le prier de faire donner tous les moyens nÃ©cessaires pour faire diligence. enfin, prenez bien garde Ã  ceci, mon cher colonel, si vous mâenvoyez des ordres, sitÃ´t que cela sera dÃ©cidÃ©, envoyez chercher monsieur de lâestaing, mon aide-de-camp, et dites lui sâil vous plaÃ®t de faire partir sur le champ ma malle et la sienne sur un waggon du quartier maÃ®tre, sâil y en qui partant sur le champ, sinon sur mon propre waggon: quâil nâoublie pas surtout mes papiers. il peut ensuite venir aprÃ¨s lui mÃªme et mâapporter les lettres du gÃ©nÃ©ral. il faut quâil fasse diligence; je ne puis partir sans diffÃ©rentes choses qui sont dans ma malle; quâil se munisse lui mÃªme de ce quâil lui faut. mon adresse ici est: mrs. sword logan alley, second-street. je ne partirai point dâici avant lundi prochain afin dâattendre votre rÃ©ponse. jâai lâhonneur dâÃªtre, mon cher colonel, avec le plus parfait attachment, votre trÃ¨s humble et trÃ¨s obÃ©issant servant, du portail. col. hamilton. schuyler hamilton. philadelphia, april 8, 1780. dear sir: mentioned private conversation go secretary embassy court versailles;

tous les changements qui pouvraient survenir sur ces objets doivent mâÃªtre communiquÃ©s, afin quâÃ  votre arrivÃ©e vous puissiez avoir sous les yeux le plus de donnÃ©es possibles. les mÃªmes dÃ©tails vous attendent Ã  rhode island, et si vous ne devez les reÃ§evoir quâaprÃ¨s Ãªtre arrivÃ©, il est presque indiffÃ©rent, monsieur le chevalier, que votre escadre atterisse Ã  rhode island ou au cap henry; mais il y des circonstances qui, si elles vous Ã©taient connues, tendraient peut Ãªtre Ã  vous dÃ©terminer plutÃ´t pour lâun de ces points que pour lâautre, ou mÃªme pour un troisiÃ¨me point que vos instructions nâont pu prÃ©voir. câest pour vous rendre compte de ces circonstances que je saisis lâoccasion du fier rodrique; heureux si, dans une conjoncture oÃ¹ les moments sont dâune si grande importance, cette lettre peut anticiper de quelques jours vos dispositions. 1Âº. par le plan proposÃ© Ã  vous, monsieur le chevalier, et Ã  monsieur le comte de rochambau, les efforts combinÃ©s de lâarmÃ©e franÃ§aise et americaine doivent se porter sur new-york, et vous Ãªtes instamment priÃ© de vous rendre immÃ©diatement Ã  sandy hook. 2Âº. suivant les informations qui mâont Ã©tÃ© rÃ©cemment fournies par le gouverneur de la virginie, la ville de charlestown est prise; les ennemis embarquent une partie des troupes qui en ont fait la conquÃªte; et dâaprÃ¨s la certitude oÃ¹ nous sommes que la destination de votre escadre leur est connue, il semble que cet embarquement pourrait bien avoir pour objet de renforcer la garnison de new-york. 3Âº. la somme de leurs forces navales sur ce continent se borne Ã  trois vaisseaux de ligne, un de 50 canons, deux de 44, et quelques frÃ©gates Ã  charlestown; un vaisseau de 74 et quelques frÃ©gates, sortis de new-york depuis trois semaines et dont nous ignorons la destination. ainsi, monsieur le chevalier, la premiÃ¨re de ces considÃ©rations vous invite Ã  sandy hook; la seconde rÃ©clame votre atterrage sur un point dâoÃ¹ vous puissiez Ãªtre en mesure dâintercepter les secours destinÃ©s pour new-york, et la troisiÃ¨me vous offre un terme de comparaison entre la plus grande force qui puisse escorter ces secours, et celle avec laquelle vous pouvez les attaquer. il est encore Ã  observer quâexceptÃ© les trois vaisseaux de ligne, tous les autres (Ã  charlestown) sont dans le port, et que les plus gros nâen peuvent sortir, quâaprÃ¨s avoir Ã©tÃ© allÃ©gÃ©s, et avec la concurrence dâune haute marÃ©e et dâun vent propice. telles sont, monsieur le chevalier, les choses dont ma mission pour objet de vous rendre compte, et comme il est de toute importance que ces informations vous parviennent le plus tÃ´t possible, jâai cru ne pas devoir nÃ©gliger la probabilitÃ©, qui sâoffre de les faire devancer votre arrivÃ©e. en supposant, monsieur le chevalier, que le fier rodrique vous rencontre et que vous jugiez Ã  propos de vous rendre en droiture Ã  sandy hook, il est un moyen de faire que les dÃ©pÃ¢ches qui vous attendent Ã  rhode island et du cap henry vous parviennent aussi promptement qui si vous aviez atterri Ã  lâun de ces deux points: ce serait de dÃ©pÃªcher, vers lâun ou lâautre, lâun de vos plus lÃ©gers vaisseaux qui recevrait Ã  son bord lâofficier chargÃ© de ces dÃ©pÃªches, et vous irait rejoindre vers sandy hook, oÃ¹ vraisemblablement il se rendrait aussitÃ´t que votre flotte, ou du moins beaucoup plus tÃ´t que les rÃ©ponses de gÃ©nÃ©ral washington ou de monsieur le marquis de la fayette, aux lettres qui leur annonceraient votre arrivÃ©e. si le cap henry Ã©tait le point choisi, jâoserais vous prier, monsieur le chevalier, afin dâÃ©viter tous dÃ©lais, dâordonner quâÃ  la vue, du signal que vous savez, le vaisseau y rÃ©ponde par un signal contraire, je veux dire en avertissant la position des pavillons; quâil envoie sa chaloupe Ã  terre avec un officier muni des mots de reconnaissance; que cet officier donne la premiÃ¨re partie de ces mots et reÃ§oive de moi la seconde. par lÃ  je crois, monsieur le chevalier, que toute possibilitÃ© de surprise est sauvÃ©e, de part et dâautre, sans quâil y ait un seul instant de perdre par le cÃ©rÃ©monial de la reconnaissance. je suis, &c. &c. &c. a. hamilton. monsieur le chevalier de ternay. hamilton baron steuben. whippany, june 25, 1780. dear baron: enemy, day before yesterday, made forward movement springfield, which burnt, retired elizabethtown point. same evening crossed over staten island; there great many concurring circumstances which make probable next hear north river. west point, general wishes remain there until present appearances come some result. confidence judgment, wishes give advice assistance commanding officer. command post, only private friendly way: dare say general howe happy consult you. consider private letter, which rather convey generalâs wishes than commands. all army march toward you, pompton evening. honor be, very respectfully affectionately, humble servant, alex. hamilton. hamilton baron steuben. head-quarters, ramapo, june 30, 1780. agreeably request, dear baron, communicated project general. happily inactivity enemy given time make dispositions which render calling out militia unnecessary; whole accordingly countermanded. general requests completed object errand department, put things train, rejoin army. wrote line whippany, which made mention. honor be, yours, a. h. hamilton baron steuben. head-quarters, july 23, 1780. received, dear baron, two letters sixteenth eighteenth. formation light infantry, general already written you. presume be, ultimately, nearly proposed. smith set out, some days since, join you. bradford, am told, undecided about entering into office. col. scammel promised bring him me;

most pressing instances determine upon without delay. heard nothing since. repeated _prayers_ _exhortations_. get answer three four days, determine ourselves. major francis returned philadelphia; not seen him since arrival letters. move inquiry wish, see him. any thing him department? severe stroke upon us, is, arms, expected france, not arrived. not know able arm recruits. graves sailed hook nineteenth. playing off two days. adieu, dear baron, believe always, most respectful attachment, humble servant, a. h. bauman hamilton. west point, august 13, 1780. dear sir: cannot help laying before few thoughts, which lately engrossed whole attention, review changeable government west point. however, hope make other use such advantage; whatever improper, improperly stated, impute inability only: there please let rest, take good part say, proceeds zeal affection you, regard cause am engaged in. consideration excuse me, any seem exceed bounds which custom prescribed subalterns, treat any thing, adopt modes, superiors. continual change commanding officers, commandants, is, humble opinion, injurious post, hurtful military duty, absolutely requisite performed, preserved garrison. there nation war which pursues like mode excepting us; am therefore induced, not only consideration, weighty experience during station post, offer opinion impropriety, bad consequences. visible ill creates; damage innumerable things; irregularity continually causes; lastly, total loss many thousands which been, daily are, expended national fabric, which inevitably fall pieces, unless officer fixed post (and who competent judge fortifications, military man), matters which, think, demand consideration. town-major, good barrack-master, necessary here, necessaries life are. former regulate duty keep up discipline jurisdiction: latter take care buildings, which otherwise destroyed. next thing which falls attention, public provision, which been, daily is, exposed here lost, stolen, damaged, want sufficient shelter proper repositories. troops suffered, still suffer, other causes. cheated weights, measure, scanty allowance fatigue rum; which attest, appointed, after represented matter general mâdougall, inspect into some abuses. notwithstanding many thousands boards which came here, there not sufficient barracks, bunks, etc. fast one thing built up, another torn down again. there not, all garrison, proper guard-house conveniency soldiers, nor security criminals. powder magazine, nor store reception reserve implements war. short, whole appears, present, under care ungovernable undisciplined militia, like wild tartarâs camp, instead shining fortification all america thinks not only insurmountable barrier against incursion enemy, likewise easy defence case unforeseen disaster army. however, return subject. importance heads already mentioned, connection preceding, will, hope, obtain pardon digression into which led me; discretion leave state. letter wrote general knox some time last winter, among many things say concerning ordnance myself, made remark, wit: âthat relieving officer garrison, not like relief field: officer who knows himself relieved, leave many things undone next do; which seen, heard, experienced. beside, after once every thing rights, men then desist labor, exercise guns. new commanding officers chiefly new systems defence, which add labor labor, nothing formed systematically.â already stated more things minutely general officers here, who all agreed validity propriety. they, all liable immediate removal, there cannot any thing formed into permanent regular system. moreover, informed, owing mismanagement predecessors, obliged, after taken command, hunt materials order build own systems; issue orders upon orders, acquaint themselves persons who have, were, keeping, several branches which flow into department. let once more, confidence, assure you, suffer incessant pain sad state garrison in. rectify defects, dear sir, roused arms, never attainable. therefore let beg assist adopting some plan which soldierly, good service: which, however, done other manner, such hinted you. let general arnold all sagacity imaginable, take him some time get himself well acquainted position defence post; especially there not one single continental officer left here who any way assist him. every thing seems new here; very engineer transferred hence, whom he, some measure, depended information, regard weakest strongest parts fortress. not yet told one hundredth part say upon some subjects; finish prognosticating, ever capriciousness hold sway here, prove fatal post. am, due respect, sir, most humble servant, s. bauman, major artillery. de marbois hamilton. philadelphia, 21 aout, 1780. je viens de recevoir mon cher colonel votre lettre du 17 de ce mois. vous mây parlez de mes frÃ¨res comme si vous Ã©tiez sÃ»r quâils sont en effet prisonniers. avez-vous sur cet article plus de connaissance que je nâen ai, mâavez-vous dÃ©jÃ  Ã©crit Ã  ce sujet quelque lettre qui ne serait point parvenue. je vais Ã©crire Ã  m. de ternay Ã  ce sujet, mais en attendant je vous prie de vouloir bien communiquer tous les Ã©claircissements que vous aurez pu vous procurer, et dâÃªtre persuadÃ© que rien ne touche plus que de leur procurer de soulagement sâils sont en effet entre les mains de lâennemi. si vous avez quelques nouvelles derniÃ¨res touchant lâembarcation que m. le gÃ©nÃ©ral clinton prÃ©pare, je vous prie de vouloir bien mâen instruire, cet article Ã©tant de la plus grande importance pour nous. je vous embrasse de tout mon cÅur. de marbois. col. hamilton. williams hamilton. hillsborough, august 30, 1780. dear hamilton: about twenty-third instant, wrote friend harrison salisbury, giving him very hasty particular account defeat general gatesâs army suttonâs, near campden, sixteenth instant. truly unfortunate, completely routed. infamous cowardice militia virginia north carolina, gave enemy every advantage over few regular troops, whose firm opposition gallant behavior gained applause, well successful foes, runaway friends. mentioned col. harrison loss two howitzers, mistaken. eight pieces light artillery, six ammunition wagons, which, greatest part baggage, lost. retreat most mortifying happened. who escaped dangers field, knew not find protection: wounded found relief inhabitants, who immediately arms against us; many fugitive officers men disarmed faithless villains, who flattered promises joining against enemy. tories now assembling different parts country; there actually sort partisan war waged between whigs country. greatest part baggage plundered who first left field. enemy took part; much escaped them, pillaged inhabitants retreat. wagon horses stolen, frequently taken drivers; some desperate rascals daring enough fire upon parties regular troops many miles place action. general gates used utmost expedition getting lost field place. step unaccountable me, expect know reason another time, better authority. unfortunate general usually loses confidence army; much case present. however, suppose every thing necessary done, justification steps taken, then all understood. beside ignorance, there another reason silence subject. general extremely mortified disappointment hopes met with; think ungenerous oppress dejected spirits premature censure. legislature state now sitting place, devising means defending country. general exhibited estimates (he informs me) supplies wanting carry campaign, both legislature state, virginia; hopes furnished. officers north carolina talk confidently re-embodying great number militia. general stephens collected about eight hundred virginia militia place since action. am sorry add, least half number deserted. maryland division, including delaware regiment, will, hope, muster six hundred all collected. part now here: party general smallwood ellisâs ferry, adkin river; small party major anderson, who general smallwood left some time charlotte, receive fugitives arrived. place general rendezvous. best accounts get, lord cornwallis him, day battle, seventy-first, sixty-third, thirty-third, twenty-third british regiments; corps hessians, tarltonâs legion, some new levies, amounting about three thousand men. numbers very little greater; force not imagined great, who informed long march barren country, very little other subsistence than short allowance fresh beef, green corn, apples, peaches. soon recover relaxation spirits, which all present complaint, write again, inform resolved not despair, bear fortunes like veterans south; while you, like heroes north, win wear laurels present campaign. present most respectful compliments general, whom love; all friends head quarters camp. not man among generous enough write single sentence sincere friend servant, o. h. williams. mentioned surprise general sumpterâs party, which happened sixteenth instant, last. hamilton james duane. liberty pole, september 8, 1780. dear sir: agreeably request, promise, sit down give ideas defects present system, changes necessary save ruin. may, perhaps, reveries projector, rather than sober views politician. judge them, make use please them. fundamental defect want power congress. hardly worth while show consists, seems universally acknowledged; point out happened, only question remedy it. may, however, said, originated three causes; excess spirit liberty, which made particular states show jealousy all power not own hands; jealousy led exercise right judging last resort measures recommended congress, acting according own opinions propriety, necessity; diffidence, congress, own powers, which timid indecisive resolutions: constantly making concessions states, till scarcely left themselves shadow power; want sufficient means disposal answer public exigencies, vigor draw forth means; which occasioned depend states individually, fulfil engagements army; consequence which, ruin influence credit army, establish dependence each state separately, rather than _on them_, is, rather than whole collectively. pleaded, congress never any definite powers granted them, and, course, exercise none, nothing more than recommend. manner which congress appointed, warrant, public good required, considered themselves vested full power _to preserve republic harm_. done many highest acts sovereignty, which always cheerfully submitted to: declaration independence; declaration war: levying army; creating navy; emitting money; making alliances foreign powers; appointing dictator, etc., etc. all implications complete sovereignty never disputed, standard whole conduct administration. undefined powers discretionary powers, limited only object which given; present case, independence freedom america. confederation made difference; not generally adopted, operation. recollect it, congress even descended authority which spirit act gives them; while particular states further attended it, than suited pretensions convenience. take too much time enter into particular instances, each which separately appear inconsiderable; united, serious import. only mean remark, not censure. confederation itself defective, requires altered. neither fit war nor peace. idea uncontrollable sovereignty, each state, over internal police, defeat other powers given congress, make union feeble precarious. there instances without number, acts, necessary general good, which rise out powers given congress, interfere internal police states; there many instances which particular states, arrangements internal police, effectually, though indirectly, counteract arrangements congress. already examples this, which refer own memory. confederation gives states, individually, too much influence affairs army. nothing it. entire formation disposal military forces, belong congress. essential cement union: policy congress, destroy all ideas state attachments army, make look up wholly them. purpose, all appointments, promotions, provisions, whatsoever, made them. apprehended dangerous liberty. nothing appears more evident me, than run much greater risk weak disunited federal government, than one which able usurp upon rights people. already some lines army obey states opposition congress, notwithstanding pains taken preserve unity army. any thing hinder this, personal influence general; melancholy mortifying consideration. forms state constitutions, always give great weight affairs, make too difficult bend pursuit common interest; too easy oppose whatever not like: form partial combinations subversive general one. there wide difference between situation, empire under one simple form government, distributed into counties, provinces, districts, which legislatures, merely magistratical bodies, execute laws common sovereign. here danger is, sovereign too much power, oppress parts which composed. case, empire composed confederated states; each government completely organized within itself, all means draw subjects close dependence itself; danger directly reverse. is, common sovereign not power sufficient unite different members together, direct common forces interest happiness whole. leagues among old grecian republics proof this. continually war each other; and, want union, fell prey neighbors. frequently held general councils; resolutions further observed, than suited interests inclinations all parties; and, length, sunk entirely into contempt. swiss cantons another proof doctrine. wars each other, which fatal them, not different powers, neighborhood, too jealous one another, too equally matched, suffer either take advantage quarrels. remained long united all, attributed weakness, poverty, causes just mentioned. ties not exist america; little time hence, some states powerful empires; remote other nations, all leisure opportunity wish, cut each otherâs throats. germanic corps also cited example favor position. united provinces thought one against it. family stadtholders, whose authority interwoven whole government, strong link union between them. physical necessities, habits founded upon them, contributed it. each province too inconsiderable, itself, undertake any thing. analysis present constitutions, show many ties which not exist ours; means proper model us. own experience satisfy us. felt difficulty drawing out resources country, inducing states combine equal exertions common cause. ill success last attempt striking. some done great deal; others little, scarcely any thing. disputes about boundaries, etc., testify flattering prospect future tranquillity, not frame, time, confederacy capable deciding differences, compelling obedience respective members. confederation, too, gives power purse too entirely state legislatures. provide perpetual funds, disposal congress, land tax, poll tax, like. all imposts upon commerce laid congress, appropriated use. for, without certain revenues, government power. power which holds purse-strings absolutely, rule. seems medium which, without making congress altogether independent, tend give reality authority. another defect system, want method energy administration. partly resulted other defect; great degree prejudice, want proper executive. congress kept power too much own hands, meddled too much details every sort. congress is, properly, deliberative corps; forgets itself attempts play executive. impossible such body, numerous is, constantly fluctuating, ever act sufficient decision, system. two-thirds members, one half time, cannot know gone before them, connection subject hand transacted former occasions. members who more permanent, only give information promotes side espouse present case; often mislead enlighten. variety business distract; proneness every assembly debate, all times delay. lately, congress, convinced inconveniences, gone into measure appointing boards. is, opinion, bad plan. single man, each department administration, greatly preferable. give chance more knowledge, more activity, more responsibility, and, course, more zeal attention. boards partake part inconveniences larger assemblies. decisions slower, energy less, responsibility more diffused. not same abilities knowledge administration single men. men first pretensions not readily engage them; because less conspicuous, less importance, less opportunity distinguishing themselves. members boards take less pains inform themselves arrive eminence, because fewer motives it. all reasons conspire give preference plan vesting great executive departments state hands individuals. men be, course, all times under direction congress, blend advantages monarchy republic constitution. question made, whether single men found undertake offices. think could; because there then every thing excite ambition candidates. but, order this, congress, manner appointing them, line duty marked out, show earnest making officers, officers real trust importance. fear little vanity stood way arrangements, though lessen importance congress, leave nothing do. precisely same rights powers heretofore, happily disencumbered detail. inspect conduct ministers, deliberate upon plans, originate others public good; only observing rule: consult ministers, get all information advice them, before entered into any new measures, made changes old. third defect is, fluctuating constitution army. pregnant source evil: all military misfortunes, three-fourths civil embarrassments, ascribed it. general fully enumerated mischiefs it, letter congress, only repeat said, therefore refer letter. imperfect unequal provision made army, fourth defect, which find delineated same letter. without speedy change, army dissolve. now mob, rather than army; without clothing, without pay, without provision, without morals, without discipline. begin hate country neglect us. country begin hate oppressions them. congress long jealous us. now lost all confidence them, give worst construction all do. held together slenderest ties, ripening dissolution. present mode supplying army, state purchases, not one least considerable defects system. too precarious dependence; because states never sufficiently impressed necessities. each make own ease primary object; supply army secondary one. variety channels through which business transacted, multiply number persons employed, opportunities embezzling public money. popular spirit which most governments turn, state agents men less character ability: nor there rigid responsibility among them, there easily among employ continent; course, not much diligence, care, economy. very little money raised several states, go into continental treasury, pretence, all exhausted providing quotas supplies; public without funds other demands government. expense ultimately much greater, advantages much smaller. actually feel insufficiency plan; reason dread, under it, ruinous extremity want. principal defects, present system, now occur me. there many inferior ones, organization particular departments, many errors administration, which pointed out; task troublesome tedious: once remedied mentioned, others not attended much difficulty. now propose remedies, which appear applicable circumstances, necessary extricate affairs present deplorable situation. first step be, give congress powers competent public exigencies. happen two ways: one, resuming exercising discretionary powers suppose originally vested them, safety states; resting conduct candor countrymen, necessity conjuncture: other, calling immediately convention all states, full authority conclude finally upon general confederation; stating them, beforehand, explicitly, evils arising want power congress, impossibility supporting contest present footing; delegates come, possessed proper sentiments, well proper authority, give efficacy meeting. commission include right vesting congress whole, proportion, unoccupied lands, employed purpose raising revenue: reserving jurisdiction states whom granted. first plan, expect, thought too bold expedient, generality congress; and, indeed, practice hitherto, riveted opinion want power, success experiment very well doubted. see objection other mode, any weight, competition reasons it. convention assemble first november next. sooner better. disorders too violent admit common lingering remedy. reasons which require vested plenipotentiary authority, are, business suffer delay execution; may, reality, come effect. convention agree upon confederation: states, individually, hardly ever will. one all events, vigorous one, mean succeed contest, happy hereafter. said before, engage states comply mode, congress confess them, plainly unanimously, impracticability supporting affairs present footing, without solid coercive union. ask, convention power vesting whole, part, unoccupied lands congress; because necessary body some property, fund arrangements finance; know other kind given them. confederation, opinion, give congress complete sovereignty; except part internal police, which relates rights property life among individuals, raising money internal taxes. necessary every thing belonging this, regulated state legislatures. congress complete sovereignty all relates war, peace, trade, finance; management foreign affairs; right declaring war; raising armies, officering, paying them, directing motions every respect; equipping fleets, same them; building fortifications, arsenals, magazines, etc., etc.; making peace such conditions think proper; regulating trade, determining countries carried on; granting indulgencies; laying prohibitions all articles export, import; imposing duties; granting bounties premiums raising, exporting, importing, applying own use, product duties; only giving credit states whom raised, general account revenues expenses; instituting admiralty courts, etc.; coining money; establishing banks such terms, such privileges, think proper; appropriating funds, whatever else relates operations finance; transacting every thing foreign nations; making alliances, offensive defensive; treaties commerce, etc., etc. confederation provide certain perpetual revenues, productive, easy collection; land tax, poll tax, like; which, together duties trade, unlocated lands, give congress substantial existence, stable foundation schemes finance. more supplies necessary, occasionally demanded states, present mode quotas. second step recommend, is, congress instantly appoint following great officers state. secretary foreign affairs, president war, president marine, financier, president trade. instead last, board trade preferable, regulations trade slow gradual; require prudence experience more than other qualities; which boards very well adapted. congress choose offices, men first abilities, property, character, continent; such best opportunities acquainted several branches. general schuyler, whom mentioned, make excellent president war; general mâdougall very good president marine. mr. robert morris many things favor department finance. could, own personal influence, give great weight measures adopt. dare say men, equally capable, found other departments. know not not good plan let financier president board trade; only casting voice determining questions there. there connection between trade finance, which make director one acquainted other; financier not direct affairs trade, because, sake acquiring reputation increasing revenues, adopt measures depress trade. relates finance, alone. officers nearly same powers functions france analogous them: each chief department; subordinate boards, composed assistants, clerks, etc., execute orders. opinion, plan kind inconceivable utility affairs: benefits very speedily felt. give new life energy operations government. business conducted dispatch, method, system. million abuses, now existing, corrected; judicious plans formed executed public good. another step immediate necessity, is, recruit army war, least three years. done mode similar which practised sweden. there inhabitants thrown into classes sixteen; sovereign wants men, each classes furnish one. raise fixed sum money; one class willing become soldier, receives money offers himself volunteer. none found this, draught made; whom lot falls, receives money, obliged serve. minds people prepared thing kind. heavy bounties obliged pay men serve few months, disgusted mode, made desirous another, will, once all, answer public purposes, obviate repetition demand. ought, all means, attempted; congress frame general plan, press execution upon states. confederation comes framed, provide fundamental law; hereafter there doubt success. cannot now wait this. want replace men whose times service expire first january: then, without this, army remaining; enemy please. general, letter already quoted, assigned most substantial reasons paying immediate attention point. congress endeavor, both upon credit europe, every possible exertion country, provide clothing officers; abolish whole system state supplies. making good depreciation currency, all other compensations army, immediately taken up congress, not left states. accounts depreciation liquidated, governmental certificates given due, specie, equivalent specie, give satisfaction; appointing periodical settlements future depreciation. placing officers upon half-pay during life, great stroke policy; give congress stronger tie upon than any thing else do. man, reflects moment, prefer permanent provision kind any temporary compensation. nor opposed economy: difference between this, between already done, insignificant. benefit widows confined whose husbands die during war. survivors, not more than one half, usual calculation menâs lives, exceed seven years which half-pay already established. beside this, whatever visionary speculations some men time, find indispensable, after war, keep foot considerable body troops: all officers, retained purpose, deducted out half-pay list. any one take pains calculate expense principles, am persuaded find addition expense, establishment proposed, means national object. advantages securing attachment army congress, binding service substantial ties, immense. then discipline; army reality, well name. congress then solid basis authority consequence: for, me, axiom, constitution, army essential american union. providing supplies, pivot every thing else (though well-constituted army would, not small degree, conduce this, giving consistency weight government). there four ways, all which united: foreign loan; heavy pecuniary taxes; tax kind; bank founded public private credit. foreign loan, dare say congress every thing power obtain it. most effectual way tell france, that, without it, make terms great britain. done plainness firmness; respect, without petulance; not menace, candid declaration circumstances. need not fear deserted france. interest honor too deeply involved fate; make possible compromise. assist us, convinced absolutely necessary; either lending us, herself, becoming surety, influencing spain. astonishing, any man doubted, any period affairs, necessity foreign loan. self-evident, not fund wealth country capable affording revenues equal expenses. then create artificial revenues, borrow. first done; foreseen expedient not last, provided time failure. here error congress. good reason believe, measures not taken, earnest, early enough procure loan abroad. give honor, first outset, thought now, wished foreign loan; not only because foresaw essential, because considered tie upon nation which derived, mean prop cause europe. concerning necessity heavy pecuniary taxes, need say nothing; point which every body agreed. nor there any danger, product any taxes, raised way, overburthen people, exceed wants public. indeed, all paper circulation drawn annually into treasury, neither one nor other. tax kind, necessity results principle: money circulation not sufficient representative productions country; and, consequently, revenues, raised medium, competent representative part products country which bound contribute support public. public, therefore, obtain due, satisfy just demands, wants, call part products themselves. done all countries which not commercial: russia, prussia, denmark, sweden, etc., peculiarly necessary case. congress, calling specific supplies, seem view;

expected enterprising temper, gladly embraced splendid opportunity. not choose diverted moment favorite object; probably apprehension some different disposition taken place, which excluded him. extreme solicitude discovered get possession post, led suspicion treachery, possible, his past conduct, supposed him capable it. correspondence thus begun, carried between arnold major andrÃ©, adjutant-general british army, behalf sir henry clinton, under feigned signatures, mercantile disguise. intercepted letter arnoldâs, which lately fell into hands, proposes interview, âto settle risks profits copartnership;â and, same style metaphor, intimates expected augmentation garrison;

one general putnam, inclosed another himself; proposing interview putnam, or, his absence, arnold, adjust some private concerns. one general putnam, evidently meant cover other, case, accident, letters fallen under inspection third person. general washington crossed river, his way hartford, day dispatches arrived. arnold, conceiving heard flag, thought necessary, sake appearances, submit letters him, ask his opinion propriety complying request. general, his usual caution, though without least surmise design, dissuaded him it, advised him reply robinson, whatever related his private affairs, civil nature, only properly addressed civil authority. reference fortunately deranged plan; first link chain events led detection. interview longer take place form flag, obliged managed secret manner. arnold employed one smith go board vulture night twenty-second, bring andrÃ© shore, pass mr. john anderson. andrÃ© came ashore accordingly; conducted within picket ours house smith, arnold remained together close conference all night day following. daylight morning, commanding officer kingâs ferry, without privity arnold, moved couple pieces cannon point opposite vulture lay, obliged take more remote station. event, some lurking distrust, made boatmen refuse convey two passengers back, disconcerted arnold much, one strokes infatuation which often confound schemes men conscious guilt, insisted andrÃ©âs exchanging his uniform disguise, returning mode different which came. andrÃ©, who undesignedly brought within posts first instance, remonstrated warmly against new dangerous expedient. arnold persisting declaring impossible him return came, length reluctantly yielded his direction, consented change his dress, take route recommended. smith furnished disguise, evening passed kingâs ferry him, proceeded crompond, stopped remainder night, instance militia officer, avoid suspected him. next morning resumed journey, smith accompanying andrÃ© little beyond pineâs bridge, left him. reached tarrytown, taken up three militia men, who rushed out woods seized his horse. critical moment, his presence mind forsook him. instead producing his pass, which extricated him parties, done him harm his own, asked militia men, _upper_ _lower_ party; distinctive appellations known among enemyâs refugee corps. militia men replied, lower party; upon which told british officer, pressed not detain him, upon urgent business. confession removed all doubts; vain afterwards produced his pass. instantly forced off place greater security, where, after careful search, there found, concealed feet his stockings, several papers importance, delivered him arnold! among these, plan fortifications west point; memorial engineer attack defence place; returns garrison, cannon, stores; copy minutes council war held general washington few weeks before. prisoner, first, inadvertently ordered arnold; recollection, while still way, countermanded, sent old salem. papers inclosed letter general washington, which, taken route different which returned, made circuit afforded leisure another letter, through ill-judged delicacy, written arnold information andersonâs capture, get him hour before general washington arrived his quarters; time enough elude fate awaited him. went down river his barge vulture such precipitate confusion, not take him single paper useful enemy. first notice affair, pursued, much too late overtaken. there some color imagining part plan betray general into hands enemy. arnold very anxious ascertain him precise day his return; enemyâs movements seem corresponded point. really case, very injudicious. success depended surprise; officers advanced posts not secret, measures given alarm; general washington, taking command post, rendered whole scheme abortive. arnold, true, dispersed garrison, made defence difficult, not impracticable; acquisition west point such magnitude enemy, unwise connect any other object, however great, which make obtaining precarious. arnold, moment before setting out, went into mrs. arnoldâs apartment, informed some transactions just come light, which ever banish him his country. fell into swoon declaration: left it, consult his own safety, till servants, alarmed cries, came relief. remained frantic all day; accusing every one who approached her, intention murder child (an infant arms); exhibiting every other mark most genuine agonizing distress. exhausted fatigue tumult spirits, phrensy subsided towards evening, sank into all sadness affliction. impossible not touched situation. every thing affecting female tears, misfortunes beauty; every thing pathetic wounded tenderness wife, apprehensive fondness mother; and, till reason change opinion, add, every thing amiable suffering innocence; conspired make object sympathy all who present. experienced most delicate attentions, every friendly office, till departure philadelphia. andrÃ© was, without loss time, conducted head quarters army, immediately brought before board general officers, prevent all possibility misrepresentation, cavil part enemy. board reported, considered spy, and, according laws nations, suffer death; which executed two days after. never, perhaps, any man suffer death more justice, deserve less. first step took, after his capture, write letter general washington, conceived terms dignity without insolence, apology without meanness. scope vindicate himself imputation assumed mean character treacherous interested purposes; asserting involuntarily impostor; contrary his intention, which meet person intelligence neutral ground, betrayed within posts, forced into vile condition enemy disguise; soliciting only, that, whatever rigor policy devote him, decency treatment observed, due person, who, though unfortunate, guilty nothing dishonorable. his request granted full extent; for, whole progress affair, treated most scrupulous delicacy. brought before board officers, met every mark indulgence, required answer interrogatory which even embarrass his feelings. his part, while carefully concealed every thing involve others, frankly confessed all facts relating himself; and, upon his confession, without trouble examining witness, board made report. members not more impressed candor firmness, mixed becoming sensibility, which displayed, than penetrated liberality politeness. acknowledged generosity behavior towards him every respect, particularly this, strongest terms manly gratitude. conversation gentleman who visited him after his trial, said flattered himself never illiberal; there any remains prejudice his mind, his present experience obliterate them. one visits made him (and saw him several times during his confinement), begged bearer request general, permission send open letter sir henry clinton. âi foresee fate,â said he, âand though pretend not play hero, indifferent about life; yet am reconciled whatever happen, conscious misfortune, not guilt, brought upon me. there only one thing disturbs tranquillity. sir henry clinton too good me; lavish his kindness. am bound him too many obligations, love him too well, bear thought, reproach himself, others reproach him, supposition conceived myself obliged, his instructions, run risk did. not, world, leave sting his mind imbitter his future days.â scarce finish sentence, bursting into tears spite his efforts suppress them; difficulty collected himself enough afterwards add: âi wish permitted assure him, not act under impression, submitted necessity imposed upon me, contrary own inclination his orders.â his request readily complied with; wrote letter annexed, which dare say much pleased am, both diction sentiment. his sentence announced him, remarked, since his lot die, there still choice mode, which make material difference his feelings;

infinitely exceed apprehended. really carrying war enemyâs country; cannot establish most inconsiderable magazine, convey smallest quantity stores one post another, without obliged detach guards security. division among people much greater than imagined; whigs tories persecute each other little less than savage fury. there nothing murders devastations every quarter. loss our army charleston, defeat general gates, cause keeping such shoals militia foot; service accompanied such destruction loss, almost laid waste whole country. nothing more destructive true interest country than mode adopted defence. two misfortunes happening one after other, rendered unavoidable last season; continued, inhabitants inevitably ruined, resources country rendered incapable affording support army competent defence. government here infinitely more popular than northward; there such thing national character national sentiment. inhabitants all quarters globe, various opinions, projects, schemes, manners habits early education. office, vanity thought powerful, join measure imposing upon public respecting strength resources southern states: while congress, minister france, kept under fatal delusion, fear little support given department. inhabitants numerous; rather formidable abroad than home. scattered over such vast extent country, difficult collect, still more difficult subsist them. there great spirit enterprise among black people; come out volunteers not little formidable enemy. there are, also, some particular corps under sumpter, marion, clarke, bold daring; rest militia better calculated destroy provisions than oppose enemy. philadelphia, all journey through country, endeavored impress upon power, necessity sending clothing, supplies every kind, immediately army. poverty urged plea, bar every application. all promised fair, fear little: ability wanting some, inclination others. public credit totally lost, private people not give aid, though see themselves involved one common ruin. opinion general washingtonâs influence more than all assemblies upon continent. always thought him exceeding popular; many places little less than adored, universally admired. his influence country possibly effect something great. however, found myself exceedingly well received, more friend general, than own merit. country wants, defence, small well appointed army, organized move great celerity. consist about five thousand infantry, eight hundred thousand horse. enemy cannot maintain larger force quarter, neither we. resources country too small subsist large body troops any one point: draw supplies distance, through such long tracts barren land, next impossible, unless business aided water transportation; and, either case, accompanied amazing expense. get superiority horse, soon render difficult lord cornwallis hold his position far country. nor under any apprehensions, much inferior force his, taking post near him, such body horse. enemyâs horse much superior ours, cannot move detachment towards without hazarding ruin. came army, found most wretched condition. officers lost all confidence general, troops all discipline. troops not only lost discipline, addicted plundering terror country. general met least upon very civil terms; expressed greatest happiness appointed succeed him. general smallwood not upon good terms; former suspected latter intention supplant him, many think without reason. others, again, opinion, his suspicions well founded, smallwood not little mortified appointed department, got outrageous heard baron steuben coming also. matter was, know not; certain is, gone home, refused act under baron steuben, declares not serve all, unless congress give him commission, dated least two years before his appointment. this, think, never happen, notwithstanding his private merit, claim state. battle camden here represented widely different northward. colonel williams thinks none general officers entitled any extraordinary merit. action short, succeeded flight, wherein every body took care himself, well officers soldiers. not officer, except major anderson, one two captains, brought off field battle single soldier. colonel also says, general gates shared little more disgrace than common lot unfortunate, notwithstanding early off, only halted waxhaws charlotte--the first about sixty, last about eighty miles field battle. little incidents either give destroy reputation! many long hours man labor honest zeal his countryâs service, disgraced most trifling error either conduct opinion! hume very justly observes, man reputation unless useful society, his merit abilities may. therefore, necessary man fortunate, well wise just. greater part loss maryland line, action camden, happened after began retreat: indeed, case all troops. gave smallwood such great reputation, his halt salisbury, which nothing accident. know there great parties prevailing maryland line;

council determined winter there; difficulty procuring subsistence, other reasons, induced not only take new position, make entire new disposition. all effected single order, first made necessary inquiry respecting new positions, sending man examine grounds other requisites. cannot inspire army confidence respect independent conduct, foresee impossible instil discipline order among troops. general leslie arrived, joined lord cornwallis, whose force now more than three times larger than ours. subsisting ourselves our own industry;

know uneasiness which moment exists among eastern officers, account commands conferred upon colonel gimat major galvan, although result absolute necessity. circumstances admit formation another advanced corps, which see very little prospect, present appearances, small, composed almost entirely eastern troops: add discontents officers lines, further appointment officer rank command it, it, would, am certain, involve difficulty very disagreeable delicate nature; might, perhaps, lead consequences more serious than easy imagine. while adhere firmly right making such appointments request, am same time obliged reflect, not push right too far; more especially service like ours, time critical present. am convinced officer can, justice, dispute merit abilities. opposition heretofore made, not want qualifications gentlemen who are, have been, objects discontent. officers line contend, without reference particular persons, hardship reflection upon them, introduce brevet officers into commands (of some permanency), which there more opportunities distinguishing themselves than line army large, men have trouble discipline prepare field. principal concern arises apprehension, impute refusal request other motives than have expressed;

fact, which dare say well apprised myself, our friends europe same disposition. have situation enabled obtain better idea than most others; venture assert, court france never give half succors country, while congress hold reins administration own hands, which grant, intrusted individuals established reputation, conspicuous probity, abilities, fortune. respect ourselves, there universal rooted diffidence government, that, assured future measures congress dictated most perfect wisdom public spirit, there still necessity change forms our administration, give new spring current passions hopes people. appears evident, executive ministry, composed men qualifications have described, speedily restore credit government abroad home--would induce our allies greater exertions our behalf--would inspire confidence moneyed men europe, well america, lend sums which demonstrated stand need, disproportion our national wealth expenses war. hope, sir, not consider compliment, assure heard, greatest satisfaction, nomination department finance. letter mine, last summer, mr. duane, urging, among other things, plan executive ministry, mentioned person who fill department. know other america, who unites many advantages; course every impediment acceptance, subject chagrin. flatter myself congress not preclude public services obstinate refusal reasonable conditions; and, one deeply interested event, am happy believing not easily discouraged undertaking office, which render america, world, less service than establishment american independence! âtis introducing order into our finances--by restoring public credit--not gaining battles, finally gain our object. âtis putting ourselves condition continue war--not temporary, violent, unnatural efforts bring decisive issue, shall, reality, bring speedy successful one. frankness truth believe, sir, man best capable performing great work. expectation all difficulties removed, ultimately act terms approve, take liberty submit some ideas, relative objects department. pretend not able financier: part administration which least way, and, course, least occupied inquiries reflections. neither have leisure materials make accurate calculations. have obliged depend memory important facts, want authorities which drawn. all disadvantages, plan necessarily crude defective; basis something more perfect, contains any hints use you, trouble have taken myself, give you, not misapplied. any rate, confidence have judgment, assures receive, pleasure, communications sort: contain any thing useful, promote views public benefit; not, only evil trouble reading them; best informed frequently derive lights, even reveries projectors quacks. there scarcely any plan bad not have something good it. trust candor without further apology; least justice intention. first step towards determining done finances country, estimate, best manner can, capacity revenue; proportion between able afford, stands need of, expenses civil military establishments. there occur two ways doing this: 1st. examining proportion revenues other countries have borne stock wealth, applying rule ourselves, proper allowance difference circumstances. 2d. comparing result rule product taxes states which have most earnest taxation. reason recourse first method is, our own experience our faculties respect, not sufficiently clear, uniform, admit certain conclusion: more satisfactory judge general principle, drawn example other nations, compared have effected ourselves, than rely entirely upon latter. nations whose wealth revenues best acquainted, france, great britain, united provinces. real wealth nation, consisting labor commodities, estimated sign wealth--its circulating cash. there times when, particular accidents, quantity exceed fall short just representative; turn again proper level, and, general course things, maintain itself state. circulation france almost wholly carried precious metals; current cash estimated fifteen sixteen hundred millions livres. net revenue kingdom, sum which actually passes into public coffers, somewhere between three hundred sixty four hundred millions, about one fourth whole currency. estimate wealth nation liable less fallacy than other two, makes little use paper credit, which artificially increased, even supported, long time beyond natural bounds. supposed gross sum extracted people collectors revenue, one-third more than which goes into treasury: exactions excessive, fall too heavy particular orders, who means reduced indigence misery, inferred, that, moderate reasonable expenses collection, present revenue great kingdom well afford, present quantity wealth. circulating cash great britain, paper specie, stated about forty millions pounds sterling. mr. hume supposes have been, time wrote his essay balance trade, about thirty millions. other writers have carried fifty, probably medium shall find truth. not include this, whole amount bank notes, exchequer bills, india bonds, etc. etc.; only such part really employed common circulation, performs offices current cash. â75, dr. priceâs statement, net revenue great britain ten millions--that is, about one-fourth current cash, france. have never met any calculation depended upon, current cash seven provinces. almost whole coin, well large quantities plate bullion, shut up bank amsterdam. real wealth bank believed about fifteen millions sterling; though, upon strength fund, credit almost unlimited, answers all purposes cash trade. dutch, prudent maxims, have commonly rate exchange throughout europe favor, considerable balance trade, use paper credit (which, part, also depends upon particular nature banks) not same tendency them, england, banish precious metals. therefore suppose here, france, true sign wealth nation. fifteen millions bank, add two millions specie retail circulation various transactions business, shall, imagine, have nearly true stock wealth united provinces. revenues amount something more than four millions, bear same proportion stock which drawn, france england. confess, however, data, case, not sufficiently ascertained permit rely equally result. three examples venture deduce general rule,--that proportion revenue which nation capable affording, about one-fourth circulating cash, far just representative labor commodities. only applicable commercial countries, because, which not so, circulating cash not adequate sign. great part domestic commerce carried barter; state receive part dues labor commodities themselves. proportion, however, revenues such state aggregate labor commodities, same case trading nations circulating cash; difference, difficulty collection transportation, waste embezzlement inseparable mode revenue, make real advantage ultimate gain state, infinitely less than public dues paid cash. say one-fourth part stock wealth revenue which nation capable affording government, understood qualified, not absolute sense. presumptuous fix precise boundary ingenuity financiers, patience people: safely say, taxation already carried, nations have speaking of; extent which not admit very considerable increase without proportionable increase industry. suffices standard us; proceed application. comparison several estimates have seen, quantity current cash country previous war (specie paper), have settled opinion amount thirty millions dollars, which about eight have specie: one-fourth this, analogy, time proper revenue states; is, seven half millions dollars. taxation, however, has, slow gradations, carried extreme countries which have chosen examples, not be, course time, practicable this, people have little accustomed taxes, doubted whether possible raise same proportion revenue here. object war, imagine, supply want habit, reconcile minds people paying utmost abilities, provided taxes judiciously imposed, revenues wisely administered. besides this, there circumstance our favor, which puts power government raise equal proportion revenue without burthening lower classes people same degree europe. circumstance much greater equality fortunes, which means men, this country, made contribute public exigencies much juster proportion property; this fact case. france rich have gained entire ascendant, there constant sacrifice ease happiness people their avarice luxury: their burthens proportion middle order, still less poor. england holland case, though not altogether, great measure same. there also men very large moneyed capitals, which either formerly exempt taxes public funds, or, visible representative taxation operate upon, enjoy virtually same advantages. if, commencement war, ability states revenue rated seven half millions dollars, amount circulating cash thirty millions, now reduced more than one-half real value, revenue supposed equal this time? judge about one-fifth less, not more. diminution our circulating cash principally artificial. true, our foreign commerce declined war, our domestic commerce increased. know good reason believe, quantity labor commodities have materially diminished. our exports have lessened, our internal consumption augmented. men employed army, departments connected it, consume waste three times much same number men civil life. number husbandmen have taken their ploughs into military service; progress our natural population has, part, supplied their place; demands war have increased individual industry. great influx money, first operated upon avarice people, and, long time, served also stimulus industry, which taxation since kept up principle necessity. notwithstanding demands competitions two armies supplies, see corn, which staple middle states, cheaper than some years before war; strong argument plenty. infer all this, stand need now nearly same quantity medium our circulation before war. depreciation money below standard, attributed want confidence rather than decay resources. find people, some states, distressed pay their taxes, want money, ample means otherwise; which proof, our current cash not competent representative labor commodities country. another proof same nature is, particular states who have found small difficulty collecting their pecuniary taxes, have successful raising contributions large amount kind. this country never country manufactures, productions soil ever were, still are, principal source revenue. inhabitants have abridged their wants foreign articles, scarcity them, have, part, supplied their place home manufactures; which, chiefly conducted women, take nothing labor appropriated agriculture, while enables farmer spare larger portion his income public. whatever diminution our means revenue have suffered, accounted decay foreign trade, loss territory. imposts trade great britain amounted about fourth total revenue. proportion less america. suppose same; suppose our external commerce reduced one-half, which believe ample allowance, then, one-eighth be deducted our revenue this account; which bring down six millions, five hundred sixty-two thousand, five hundred dollars. allow loss georgia south carolina one-eighth this sum: this reduce income remaining states five millions, seven hundred forty-two thousand, one hundred eighty-eight, four-eighths, dollars. allowance, both cases, large, diminution have already supposed, one-fifth whole, appears be nearest truth; which leaves states net revenue six millions dollars. now examine far this rule agrees experience, already effected states. massachusetts serve criterion. this one states taxation carried furthest. taxes heavy last year, am informed there real marks distress among some classes people. legislature, their late address, tell amounted six hundred thousand pounds lawful: appear have thought pressure too great, reducing time obliged have recourse large loan, answer exigencies current year. taxes specify which seem belong present year, addition bounties raising men, beef supply, be estimated near five hundred thousand pounds. this state different situation any other. its position made impossible enemy intercept its trade; while all others greatly injured totally obstructed. become, consequence, mart states northward pennsylvania; its commerce enlarged itself much beyond its former limits. great part money expended support war, disbursed there. congress, their requisitions money, have rated quota massachusetts whole; believe its ability, this time, proportion one-fifth. found this estimation impartial comparison circumstances several states. admitting proportion be just, taking taxes present year standard, gross amount our collective revenues be two millions, five hundred thousand pounds lawful; eight millions, three hundred thirty-three thousand, three hundred thirty-three, one-third, dollars. expense collection, england, about ninth gross amount; considering our revenue be raised eleven different governments, each complete set collectors its own, expense collection, us, all probability be not much less than england. supposing be same, taxes prove productive their nominal amount, our net revenue then be seven millions, four hundred seven thousand, four hundred eight, one-half, dollars; which considerably exceeds be first calculation. there considerations which induce make large deductions this sum. legislature tells us, taxes last year amounted six hundred thousand pounds, also tells there _a part_ still be levied; which, among other things, occasioned postpone next tax future session. whatever due last year, be considered, effect, anticipation taxes present; takes off much ability people pay them. chances are, additional impositions projected current year not be raised their full extent. taxes seldom never productive their estimated value; case like this, be expected be more than commonly deficient. be observed, also, last year year peculiar exertion. there general expectation some attempt, conjunction our allies, decisive war. this made people strain their efforts beyond their natural abilities: yet not comply demands legislature. money bounties this year, which have calculated sixty thousand pounds,[12] may, like manner, be regarded extraordinary special contribution, which people be willing submit to, over above probably afford pay, get rid insupportable inconvenience temporary enlistments. reasonable deductions accounts made, bring two calculations pretty exact agreement, make confirm each other. not this case, be inclined, preference, trust first, founded basis better known better ascertained experience. believe, however, safely conclude, both, between six seven millions dollars proper revenue states, after dismemberment south carolina georgia. formed estimate our ability revenue, next thing be ascertained is, annual expense our civil military establishments. tolerable economy, suppose two millions half dollars amply suffice first, including particular administration each state. second, judiciously managed, eight millions dollars be adequate, calculating army twenty thousand men, which many shall stand need of, be able[13] raise. eleven millions dollars be then amount annual expenses states. speak supposition system embraced, well adapted rescuing our affairs chaos which now involved; which, while continues, baffle all calculation. difference between our revenues expenses, preceding scale, be four four half millions dollars; which deficiency course be supplied credit, foreign domestic, both. regard credit abroad, think have little chance obtaining sufficiency, nearly answer our purpose. france, all reforms make interior economy, all means procure loans lotteries, addition revenue, little more than satisfy own wants. death empress queen, notorious hostility emperor, add number these. will, all probability, be obliged pay greater attention her army, which neglected, several years past, apply all resources kingdom improvement navy. though russia prussia, last advices, seemed disposed control ill-humor emperor, france hardly think prudent leave herself defenceless condition, relying precarious friendship momentary interests other powers. increase her army necessarily increase her expenses, cannot, present state things, retrench any thing navy; course have less money spare allies. observed, france hitherto imposed none additional taxes usual time war; doing which, imagined have her power, not only supply her own wants better, contribute largely ours. this answered, great appearance reason, credit financier very much depends his such resource reserve, which, considered mean command, necessary, fulfil his engagements, disposes moneyed men lend him greater freedom confidence. breaking upon resource, therefore (it said), injure credit, obstruct loans degree not be compensated direct value revenue furnish. upon whole, however, variety siftings inquiries, be mistaken france not lend this country eight ten millions livres annually, during war; provided its finances once put upon reasonable footing: this not above third our wants. find reason flatter ourselves have much expect either ability inclination spain. her government far rich vulgarly imagined. mines south america, late years, have less liberal their profits; and, fear accidents, small part their product, since war, imported into europe. extreme indolence spaniards, their neglect agriculture, manufactures, trade, make tributary their more industrious neighbors, who drain their precious metals fast arrive. heartily disposed it, still afford some assistance. their conduct, hitherto, manifested such disposition: cold reserved well be. bills drawn upon have not rejected, have not paid. their permitting residence british emissary among them, countenance give him, unprecedented state war, afford just room distrust their intentions, though be nothing more than stroke policy, play him off against our negotiations, make bid higher their friendship. their method prosecuting war passive, degree scarcely be resolved even into spanish supineness; seems have more corrupt original. bigoted prince, governed greedy confessor, character which little dependence be placed. âtis not spain, then, build our hopes any considerable succors money. dutch government long standing mortgaged all its revenues. taxation carried length admits little extension. âtis its credit its own citizens, derive means making war. every thing do. its fleet be manner created anew; its land forces be recruited, been, some time past, suffered decline very much. will, therefore, stand need all its credit its own uses. course have nothing expect government country. individuals not have confidence enough our public councils, embark any considerable part their fortunes us, ordinary principles loan. stronger inducements, prospect commercial advantages, securities different mere faith united states, be held out, tempt engage far us. plan am going propose, endeavors conciliate objects. internal loans, which, after all, chiefly depend, there two things operate against them, any large amount; want sufficient number men, sufficient moneyed capitals lend sums required, want confidence who able lend, make willing part their money. be added, employ greater advantage traffic, than merely lending interest. surmount obstacles, give individuals ability inclination lend, any proportion wants government, plan be devised, which, incorporating their means together, uniting public, will, foundation incorporation union, erect mass credit supply defect moneyed capital, answer all purposes cash; plan which offer adventurers immediate advantages, analogous receive employing their money trade, and, eventually, greater advantages; plan which give greatest security nature case admit lend; which not only advance their own interest, secure independence their country, but, its progress, have most beneficial influence upon its future commerce, be source national strength wealth. mean institution national bank. this regard, some shape other, expedient essential our safety success; unless, happy turn european affairs, war speedily terminate manner upon which be unwise reckon. there other give government extensive systematic credit, which defect our revenues makes indispensably necessary its operations. longer delayed, more difficult becomes. our affairs grow every day more relaxed more involved; public credit hastens more irretrievable catastrophe; means executing plan exhausted partial temporary efforts. loan now making massachusetts have gone great way establishing funds which bank stand. am aware all objections have made public banks; not without enlightened respectable opponents. all said against them, only tends prove that, like all other good things, subject abuse, and, abused, become pernicious. precious metals, similar arguments, be proven be injurious. certain mines south america have great influence banishing industry spain, sinking real wealth importance. great power, commerce, riches, or, other words, great national prosperity, may, like manner, be denominated evils; lead insolence, inordinate ambition, vicious luxury, licentiousness morals, all vices which corrupt government, enslave people, precipitate ruin nation. wise statesman reject good, apprehension ill. truth is, human affairs there good, pure unmixed: every advantage two sides: wisdom consists availing ourselves good, guarding much possible against bad. tendency national bank increase public private credit. former gives power state, protection its rights interests: latter facilitates extends operations commerce among individuals. industry increased, commodities multiplied, agriculture manufactures flourish: herein consists true wealth prosperity state. most commercial nations have found necessary institute banks: have proved be happiest engines ever invented advancing trade. venice, genoa, hamburgh, holland, england, examples their utility. owe their riches, commerce, figure have made different periods, great degree this source. great britain indebted immense efforts able make, many illustrious successful wars, essentially vast fabric credit raised this foundation. âtis this alone now menaces our independence. she has, indeed, abused advantage, now stands precipice. her example both persuade warn us. âtis republics banks most easily established supported, least liable abuse. our situation not expose frequent wars; public have temptation overstrain its credit. opinion, not hesitate, because have other resource. long expensive wars king william, drained england its specie: its commerce began droop want proper medium: its taxes unproductive, its revenues declined. administration wisely recourse institution bank; relieved national difficulties. same, still greater, want sufficient medium. have little specie: paper have small value, rapidly descending less: immersed war our existence nation, our liberty happiness people: have revenues nor credit. bank, practicable, only thing give either one other. besides great cardinal motives such institution, advantages enjoy it, common other nations, our situation, relatively europe west indies, give some peculiar advantages. nothing more common than men pass abuse good thing, disuse it. some persons, disgusted depreciation money, chimerical enough imagine be beneficial abolish all paper credit, annihilate whole now circulation, depend altogether upon our specie, both commerce finance. scheme altogether visionary, attempt be fatal. have not competent stock specie this country, either answer purposes circulation trade, serve basis revenue. whole amount have, am persuaded, not exceed six millions dollars, one-fifth circulating medium before war. suppose this be sufficient operations commerce, be suppose our domestic foreign commerce both reduced four-fifths: supposition carries absurdity face it. follows our paper money destroyed, great part transactions traffic be carried barter; mode inconvenient, partial, confined, destructive both commerce industry. addition paper now have, this evil exists too great degree. respect revenue, whole our specie be drawn into public treasury annually, have seen be little more than one half our annual expense. this be impracticable; never effected any country. numerary country sufficient representative, there only certain proportion be drawn out daily circulation; because, without necessary quantity cash, stagnation business ensue. small, then, be proportion six millions (in itself unequal representative) which public be able extract revenue. either have little revenue, receive its dues kind; inefficacy inconveniences which mode, have already remarked. necessity it, part, unhappily now place, cause assigned, deficiency current cash: establish our principal dependence, be impossible contrive mode less productive public, more contrary the habits inclinations the people, more baneful industry. waiving the objections this head, there still remain balance four millions dollars more than states furnish revenue, which be provided the yearly expense the war. this be procured without paper credit, supply the deficiency specie, enable the moneyed men lend? this question, apprehend, be easy solution. the present system things, the health state, particularly commercial one, depends due quantity regular circulation cash, much the health animal body depends upon the due quantity regular circulation the blood. there indisputable indications have not sufficient medium; have continual fluctuation. the only cure our public disorders, fix the value the currency now have, increase proper standard, species have the requisite stability. the error those who explode paper money altogether, originates not making proper distinctions. our paper was, its nature, liable depreciation, because funds its support, not upheld private credit. the emissions under the resolution march, â80, have partly the former advantage, destitute the latter, which equally essential. paper credit be substantial, durable, which not funds, which not unite, immediately, the interest influence the moneyed men, its establishment preservation. credit begun this basis, will, process time, greatly exceed its funds: this requires time, well settled opinion its favor. âtis national bank, alone, find the ingredients constitute wholesome, solid, beneficial paper credit. am aware that, the present temper menâs minds, be easy task inspire relish project this kind: much depend the address personal credit the proposer. hands not despair: have the greater hopes am informed appeared be the disposition, the promulgation the plan loan massachusetts. the men property america, enlightened about their own interest, easily be brought see the advantages good plan. not be discouraged happened heretofore, behold the administration our finances put into better channel. the violations public engagements, hitherto, have proceeded more necessity produced ignorance mismanagement, than levity disregard the obligations good faith. the success, the first instance, not be complete the extent the plan requires, this not hinder its undertaken. the nature bank, wisely instituted, wisely administered, extend itself, and, small beginnings, grow magnitude not have foreseen. the plan propose, requires stock three millions pounds, lawful money; one-half the sum be obtained, entertain doubt its full success. now remains submit plan, which rather offer outline, than finished plan. contains, however, the general principles. each article, opposite column, shall affix explanatory remark. art i. bank be remark 1. the second article, erected stock three part the stock be landed millions pounds, lawful security: this, the whole be money, the rate six exempted taxes. here be shillings dollar, divided considerable saving the proprietor, into thirty thousand shares. which be estimated among the clear this stock be exempted profits the bank. this indeed all public taxes be small reduction the public impositions whatsoever. revenue; the loss be little consequence, compared the advantages be derived the bank. art ii. subscription remark 2. admitting landed be opened the amount security part the bank stock, the stock. subscriber while establish solid funds the one share five, money emitted, the same time advance the whole specie. supply the defect specie, give subscriber six shares strong inducement moneyed men fifteen advance one-half advance their money; because, not only specie, the other half good the money actually deposited be landed security. subscriber employed their benefit, but, the sixteen shares, upwards, credit their landed security, the advance two-sixths seventh article, be raised equal specie, one-sixth bills amount cash, be also employed securities good european their benefit: which artifice funds, three-sixths good have the use their land (exempted, landed security. either case too, taxes), the use the specie, plate bullion, value representative cash. given value, proportioned this consists capital advantage the its quality, be bank the proprietors. a, instance, substituted; either case advances six hundred pounds specie, landed security, specie, much more landed security. good bills, securities the establishment draw bank notes european funds, be the whole his stock, is, admissible their stead.[14] twelve hundred pounds, only advances half the sum money. bank notes operating cash, his land (continuing, observed above, his own use, the privilege besides exemption taxes) converted into cash; which employ loans, profitable contracts, beneficial purchases, discounting bills exchange, the other methods permitted the subsequent articles. besides all this, the bank notes have once acquired fixed credit, not obliged keep his six hundred pounds, deposited specie, idle: he lend, otherwise improve, part also. advantages not exist their full extent first, soon succeed each other. art. iii. the bank remark 3. this article needs be erected into legal illustration. corporation; have all the powers immunities requisite its security, the recovery its debts, the disposal its property. art. iv. the stock remark 4. the first part the bank not be liable this regulation necessary engage any attachment seizure foreigners trust their property the whatsoever; but, refusal bank; the latter part give idea payment, the holders bank security the holders bank notes. notes, bonds, enter suit against any member, members, the corporation; and, far their respective shares the bank extend, recover the debt, cost damages, out their private property. art. v. the united remark 5. this link the states, any particular interests the public more intimately states, foreigners, the bank, be easy method become subscribers the bank, acquiring revenue. also participate its profits, facilitate the making up its stock the any sums not exceeding the loans which congress obtain abroad; whole half the stock. without which be more difficult raise large sum. essential the stock be large, because, proportion it, be the credit the bank, course its ability lend enlarge its paper emissions. the admission foreigners also assist the completing the stock; probable many be induced enter into the plan, especially after made some progress among ourselves, obtained degree consistency. the sum limited one half the stock, because primary importance the moneyed men among ourselves be deeply interested the plan. art. vi. the united remark 6. this mode pledging states, collectively the public faith, makes difficult particularly, become be infringed possibly responsible all the be devised. our situation transactions the bank, expedient offer every appearance conjointly the private security. foreigners more firmly proprietors. persuaded the establishment our independence than the continuance our union; therefore have more confidence the states bound separately than collectively. individuals among ourselves be influenced similar considerations. art vii. the bank remark 7. the reason issue notes payable sight, payable sight, inspire pounds, shillings, the greater confidence give pence, lawful: all twenty readier currency: nor do apprehend shillings, under, bear there be any danger it. interest: all above, the beginning some be carried the bear interest not exceeding bank payment, finding four per cent. the notes be punctually discharged, the applications many denominations cease. the notes payable be judged convenient pounds, shillings, pence, rather circulation, two kinds; than dollars, produce illusion one payable only america, the minds the people favorable the other payable either the new paper; rather prevent american part their transferring their europe the bank have prejudices against the old. paper credit funds. the aggregate depends much opinion, opinion notes never exceed the bank often guided outside appearances. stock. circumstance trivial this seem, have small influence the popular imagination. 20s., under, without interest, because such small sums be diffused the lesser transactions daily circulation, there be less probability their carried the bank payment. the interest the larger notes calculated give preference specie, prevent run upon the bank. the notes, however, be introduced degrees, not inundate the public once. those bearing interest not be multiplied too much first; the interest abridgment the profits the bank, after the notes have gained unequivocal credit, be advantageous issue large proportion the smaller ones. first, the interest best be four per cent., operate the more effectually motive: afterwards, the new notes, be gradually diminished: always be expedient let bear interest not less than two per cent. the making some the notes payable europe well america, necessary enable the bank avail itself its funds there: also serve raise the demand bank notes, rendering useful foreign commerce, the promoting which further inducement. the limiting the aggregate the notes the amount the stock, necessary obviate suspicion their multiplied beyond the means redemption. art. viii. the bank remark 8. the beginning lend money the public, be the advantage the bank individuals, interest not require high interest, because money exceeding eight per cent. great demand, the bank itself want the principal part its cash the loans stipulated article xiii, performing the contracts authorized article xii: the profits not, some time, turn materially the principle loans, except the public. the contracts cease, the bank find its advantage lending, moderate interest, secure preference borrowers, which will, the same time, promote commerce; kind mutual reaction, the bank assist commerce, commerce assist the bank. art. ix. the bank remark 9. this precaution have liberty borrowing, against sudden run. borrow the best terms can, the proportion pays. amount one half its stock. another advantage: particular conjunctures the bank borrow low interest, lend, others, higher. art. x. the bank remark 10. this privilege have liberty purchasing purchasing estates be very estates principal, valuable one. watching favorable annuities; the power coining opportunities, large capital, the amount half its vast property be acquired this stock, the quantity alloy, way. there be fine opening etc., determined the conclusion the war. many persons congress; also the power disaffected our independence, who discounting bills exchange. have rendered themselves odious without becoming obnoxious the laws, be disposed sell their estates here, either their whole value, annuities europe. the power coining[15] necessary, plate, bullion, admitted instead specie; be, particular occasions, expedient coin them; this be small resource the bank. the power discounting bills exchange be considerable one. its advantages consist purchasing, taking up the honor the drawer, the security good, bills exchange much per cent. discount. large profit be now made this way the bills drawn france; hereafter, times peace, commerce comes flourish, this practice promote the transactions the several states each other, europe, be very profitable the bank. art. xi. the bank remark 11. this imitation receive individuals, the bank amsterdam. individuals deposits any sums money, once get into the practice depositing be repaid called for, their money bank, give credit passed, order, the the bank, assist trade. time, credit others; deposits premium be required repayment plate, paying certain holland. small profit be annual rate safe keeping. immediately gained plate, the whatever deposited the states begin tax this article; bank, be exempt taxes. many persons dispense this time the use their plate, deposit place safety, pay less keeping than the tax. whatever serves increase the apparent wealth the bank, enhance its credit! even be useful let the owners the plate have credit bank the value the plate, estimated scale make the advantage the bank purchase. art. xii. the bank remark 12. be have right contract great importance the success the the french government the subscriptions, previous assurance supply its fleets armies contracts take place: _america_, contract the profits be trifling congress the supply inducement adventurers; have their armies. the air employing the money subscribed trade. soon, therefore, the plan be resolved upon, negotiations be begun the purpose. clearly the interest the french government enter into contracts, be blind not do it, especially proposed under the aspect method re-establishing our finances. the present loss their bills enormous. the bank engage receive moderate discount, supply better terms than now make. their business this time trusted variety hands, some which neither very skilful nor very honest: competitions, frauds, additional expense, the consequences. congress not hesitate their parts, the amount the contracts be part the loan required article xiii. art. xiii. the bank remark 13. this loan lend congress one million, enable congress get through the two hundred thousand pounds, expenses the year. there be lawful, eight per cent. small deficiency, this be easily interest;

the old, forty be danger its infecting the one thirty years, the future paper: besides, want raise new par, gold point make approach silver, according the terms nearer adequate medium. have promised congress their chosen the resolution march, â80, resolution march, â80. standard. not, any account, one-third the first be raise the value the old paper redeemed the end every higher than forty one, this ten years; the whole give about the degree value the last be redeemed the most salutary; the same time expiration the six years avoid second breach faith, specified congress, the which cause violent death interest five per cent. the all future credit. stable currency united states, compensation idea fundamental all practicable this responsibility, schemes finance. the duty establish certain funds interest the public give stability annuity, payable the bank, which now exists; be equal the discharge the the interest the bank, which alone whole amount the paper effect it, co-operate. have currency thirty years, not mentioned the amount the annuity interest two per cent. be paid congress, because have per annum. not materials judge quantity paper money now exists; since be necessary take all the state emissions into the calculation. suppose (including state emissions) there be about four hundred millions dollars the old standard, about four millions the new.[16] this give us, specie-value, about fourteen millions dollars. this the bank become answerable for, the public pay, annuity thirty years, two per cent. interest. this annuity amount six hundred eleven thousand, three hundred thirty-three, one-third, dollars, which funds be provided. rough calculation, find the bank gain, the thirty years, about three millions dollars, the simple footing interest; will, different periods, have more public money its possession, than be advance others: that, upon the whole, the sum gain interest, be the loan its credit the public, not any specific sum cash. besides, the interest the bank gain very considerable sum the purchases make the old paper its current value, before the influence this plan time bring back the point which intended be fixed.[17] the obvious interest the united states concur this plan, because, paying three millions dollars interest the bank, more than have pay the money-holders, agreeably its present engagements, avoid new breach faith, fix its circulating medium increased value more than one-half, render the taxes more productive, introduce order into its finances, without which our independence lost. also have only about two-thirds the funds establish this plan required the act march, â80, discharge the new bills: will, course, reserve large balance towards the current expenses, which insignificant consideration. perhaps be imagined, the same funds established the redemption the money the same time, without passing through the bank, have equal effect upon its credit, then save the interest two per cent. experience proves the contrary. find the new notes depreciating the states which have provided good funds. the truth is, there not confidence enough any funds merely public. the responsibility the bank beget much stronger persuasion the paper redeemed, have incomparably more efficacy raising confirming its credit. besides, the bank immediately reduce the quantity purchase, which the public not do. be observed, the six millions dollars which constitute our annual revenue, require nine hundred seventy-nine thousand, three hundred thirty-three, one-third, dollars, funds, reimburse the loan the first year, pay off the annuity the redemption the old paper. be asked, funds be procured the present impotence our federal government. answer, there ample means them, be had. congress deal plainly their constituents. tell them, power without revenue bubble; unless give substantial resources the latter, not have enough the former, either prosecute the war, maintain the union peace; that, short, must, justice the public their own honor, renounce the vain attempt carrying the war without either; perseverance which, only deceive the people, betray their safety. demand instant, positive, perpetual investiture impost trade; land tax, poll tax, be collected their own agents. this act become part the confederation. ever opinion congress have complete sovereignty all the mere municipal law each state; wish see convention all the states, full power alter amend, finally irrevocably, the present futile senseless confederation. the taxes specified, be made amount three millions dollars; the other three millions be raised requisition, heretofore. art. xv. the bank remark 15. essential notes be received payment all taxes be raised, throughout all public customs the united states, specie, taxes, equivalent bank notes par, the old paper gold silver. its current value the time payment. this serve increase the circulation credit the bank notes; person be obliged receive private dealings. their credit depend opinion; this opinion be injured legislative interposition. art. xvi. the bank remark 16. this permission dissolve itself whenever dissolve sell pleasure, thinks proper, making effectual encourage men adventure;

affairs the bank be conducted eight be chosen under joint direction. the private proprietors, four congress. the minister finance have the privilege inspecting all their proceedings. these, already observed, only intended outlines; the form administration the bank, all other matters, be easily determined, the leading principles once approved. shall find good models the different european banks, which accommodate our circumstances. great care, particular, be employed guard against counterfeits; think methods be devised be effectual. see nothing prevent the practicability plan this kind, distrust the final success the war, which make men afraid risk any considerable part their fortunes the public funds; but, without enthusiast, venture assert, that, such resource here proposed, the loss our independence impossible. all have fear is, the want money disband the army, perplex enfeeble our operations, create the people general disgust alarm, which make clamor peace any terms. judicious administration our finances, assisted bank, takes place, the ancient security property restored, convulsion be apprehended. our opposition soon assume aspect system vigor, relieve encourage the people, put end the hopes the enemy. âtis evident have not their power subdue force arms. all states have not more than fifteen thousand effective troops, nor possible much augment this number. the east west indies demand reinforcements. all the islands, have not, this time, above five thousand men; force not more than equal the proper garrisoning jamaica alone; which, the moment lose maritime superiority those seas, leave much cause fear their possessions. probably send out fifteen hundred two thousand men, recruit their regiments already here; this the utmost do. our allies have five thousand men rhode island, which, the worst event happen, be recruited eight, co-operate defensive plan. our army amount more than fifteen thousand men, the combined forces, though not equal the expulsion the enemy, be equal the purpose compelling renounce their offensive, content themselves maintaining one two capital points. this the supposition the public have the means putting their troops activity. stopping the progress their conquests, reducing unmeaning disgraceful defensive, destroy the national expectation success, which the ministry draw their resources. not vague conjecture, fact founded the best information, that, not been the capture charleston, the victory camden, the ministry have been the utmost embarrassment the supplies this year. the credit those events, procured loan five twenty millions. situation want splendid successes ruin. have carried taxation nearly its extreme boundary; have mortgaged all their funds; have large unfunded debt, besides the enormous mass which funded. this necessarily create apprehensions their most sanguine partisans: not counteracted flattering events, time time, cannot much longer continue the delusion. indeed, this case, suppose themselves despair. the game play sure game, play skill. have calculated, the preceding observations, the most disadvantageous side. many events turn up, the course the summer, make even the present campaign decisive. compare the real ability france, revenue, great britain; the economy sagacity the conduct the finances the former; the extravagance dissipation which overwhelming those the latter; there be found every reason believe, the resources france outlast those her adversary. her fleet not much inferior, independent spain holland. combined spain, greatly superior. the dutch enter into the war earnest, add their fleet, the superiority be irresistible. notwithstanding the injury sustain the first instance, the dutch be still formidable: rich credit, have extensive means maritime power. except the emperor, who hostile, the dane, who neutral, all the rest europe either friends france our independence. never nation unite more circumstances its favor than do: have nothing against our own misconduct. there two classes men among us, equally mistaken: one who, spite daily experience, accumulated distress, persist narrow line policy, and, amidst the most threatening dangers, fancy every thing perfect security. another, who, judging too much the outside, alarmed partial misfortunes, the disordered state our finances, without estimating the real faculties the parties, give themselves up ignorant ill-founded despondency. want learn appreciate our true situation the enemy. this preserve stupid insensibility danger the one hand, inspire reasonable enlightened confidence the other. let suppose the worst, shall, after all, fail our independence; our return great britain, whenever happen, be compact. the war terminate mediation. cannot be supposed the mediator be devoted great britain, have little consideration france, oblige revert our former subjection unconditional surrender. while confirm his dominion over us, endeavor save appearances the honor france, stipulate terms favorable be compatible state dependence. general amnesty, the security private property (of course the payment public debts), be among the most simple most indispensable. this comprehend the concerns the bank; if, unfortunately our virtue, such circumstance could operate inducement, be added, our enemies be glad find, encourage such institution among their own benefit. question arise concerning the abilities states pay their debts after the establishment their independence; though any doubt this head originate gross ignorance, be necessary oppose more than general argument, been done heretofore. very summary obvious calculation show there nothing be dreaded this head. the funds nine hundred seventy-nine thousand, three hundred thirty-three, one-third, dollars, proposed be established paying off the loan the first year, redeeming the present paper, will, thirty years, wipe off all the debts the states, except those contracted foreigners, which, imagine, do not amount four millions dollars. suppose be obliged, two years besides the present, borrow equal sum each year the bank; the fund requisite discharge loans, the same terms the first, amount seven hundred thirty-six thousand dollars, be deducted the five million, twenty thousand, six hundred sixty-six, two-thirds, dollars, remaining the annual revenue; which reduce four millions, two hundred eighty-four thousand, six hundred sixty-six, two-thirds, dollars: then the debt unfunded be, foreigners already contracted supposition, $4,000,000 deficiency revenue the expense be obtained credit, the first year, besides the loan the bank, 1,479,333â deficiency revenue the second year deducting the fund discharging the loan this year, 1,847,333â deficiency revenue the third year, making the same deduction, 2,215,333â ---------- $9,542,000 should, then, the war last three years longer, which probably be the utmost term its duration, shall find ourselves unfunded debt nine million, five hundred forty-two thousand dollars, unappropriated revenue four million, two hundred eighty-four thousand, six hundred sixty-six, two-thirds, dollars. the surplus four millions, which two hundred eighty-four thousand, six hundred sixty-six, two-thirds, dollars, the funds appropriated the payment the other debts which revert the public the end thirty years, be sufficient fund the redemption this debt about thirty-five years: that, according plan, the end thirty-five years states have paid off the whole debt contracted account the war; and, the mean time, have clear revenue four millions dollars, defraying the expenses their civil military establishments. this calculation supposes the ability states revenue continue the same now are, which supposition both false unfavorable. speaking within moderate bounds, our population be doubled thirty years; there be confluence emigrants all parts the world; our commerce have proportionable progress; course our wealth capacity revenue. be matter choice not out debt twenty years, without all encumbering the people. national debt, not excessive, be national blessing. be powerful cement our union. also create necessity keeping up taxation degree which, without oppressive, be spur industry, remote europe, shall be danger. otherwise be feared our popular maxims incline too great parsimony indulgence. labor less now than any civilized nation europe; habit labor the people, essential the health vigor their minds bodies, conducive the welfare the state. not suffer our self-love deceive comparison upon points. have spun out this letter much greater length than intended. develope the whole connection ideas the subject, place plan the clearest light, have indulged myself many observations which have been omitted. shall not longer intrude upon patience than assure the sincere sentiments esteem which have the honor be, sir, most obedient humble servant, a. hamilton. [12] be feared, too, this sum rated too high. hitherto have not four hundred men state, nor very promising accounts those which be expected. [13] the proportion the european armies, general, the national population, calculated one hundred. this rule, supposing our population be two a half millions, our armies consist twenty-five thousand men; the proportion naturally be less this country. our population more diffused; there a greater facility procuring subsistence, fewer poor (and consequently fewer class men whose habits, tempers, circumstances lead embrace the military life) than any other country the world. hence is, say, twenty thousand men many shall be able raise. experience justifies this opinion. the first paroxysms enthusiasm our armies larger. believe, particular periods, have more than thirty thousand men the field: our force every year diminished, been two years past below the standard have assigned. immense efforts have been made procure men, have not been able produce more. this shows our military system still susceptible great reforms favor economy; dare not make them, because cannot pay the army. also said, twenty thousand men be many stand need of. the enemy have now less than this number within the states; cannot, the future progress the war, have more. equal force, the occasional aid the militia, confine within one two capital points; this be their defeat. have a further resource the troops our allies. not dream decisive enterprises, unless our allies assist twelve fifteen thousand land troops, undisputed maritime superiority. then, the aid the militia, drawn out a few months, undertake succeed. our true policy, the meantime, is, endeavor form a solid compact force, proportioned our necessities. [14] the possibility making up large a proportion specie depend foreign assistance. could hardly be hoped effect within ourselves, if, suppose, there not more than six millions dollars states. true, plate admitted; uncertain far this prove a resource. be wished the proportion specie be large possible: but, perhaps, fear a failure, be advisable alter the above proportions, have, upon the whole, about one-third specie, two thirds european funds landed security. [15] may, perhaps, not be impossible make some profitable speculations the bullion which the spaniards afraid transport south america europe. [16] impossible too soon make some arrangement enable congress put a stop the further emission. [17] there another immense consideration. the proprietors the bank be the holders a great part this paper. have their power double the value this plan: which is, other words, gain a hundred per cent. hamilton washington. de peysterâs point, 2, 1781. sir: am extremely sorry have embarrassed late application, think there insuperable obstacles a compliance it. renounced expectations, have other inducement troubling excellency a second letter, than obviate the appearance desired a thing inconsistent the good the service, while acquainted the circumstances made so. too interested a spectator happened the case major mâpherson, not have remarked, not recollect all the circumstances. the opposition turned ostensibly his a brevet officer, yet a command a corps formed entirely one line: the propriety his employed a detachment the army large, far remember, not disputed. delicacy major mâpherson, personal objections formally made: reality existed, contributed the discontent. thought a peculiar hardship, a gentleman who had, a long time, fought against us, not taken part till a late period, our affairs assumed a more prosperous aspect, be preferred one the most honorary commands the service. excellency be convinced, mention this other view than show the sentiments the officers the time, the whole grounds the opposition. esteem major mâpherson, other reasons, make impossible have a different intention. know less the motives dissatisfaction the case colonel gimat major galvan; have understood founded their appointed the light corps two successive campaigns. be uncandid me, not acknowledge believe a disposition exclude brevet officers general command, a great share the opposition every instance; far affects case. but, the same time, appears me, this principle alone never be productive more than momentary murmurs, not seconded some plausible pretext. also am convinced the pennsylvania officers, their own sakes, repented the rash steps taken; and, cool reflection, happy opportunity relinquish their menaces quitting a service which attached habit, inclination, interest, well patriotism. believe, too, shall never have a similar instance the army, unless the practice be carried excess. major galvan, am told, probably be relieved. colonel gimat be then the only brevet officer remaining command. excellency the best judge the proper limits; there be doubt, the rights particular officers give place the general good tranquillity the service. cannot forbear repeating, case peculiar, dissimilar all the former. distinguished the circumstances have before intimated; early entrance into the service; made the campaign â76, the most disagreeable the war, the head a company artillery, been entitled, corps, a rank, equal degree, more ancient date, than now possess; made all the subsequent campaigns the family the commander-in-chief, a constant course important laborious service. pretensions, this advanced period the war, employed the only way which situation admits; imagine have their weight the minds the officers general. only urge a second time, reasons which not suffer view the matter the same light excellency, regard, impracticable, appointment a light corps, there be one formed. entreat be understood this sense only. am incapable wishing obtain any object importunity. assure excellency, am too well persuaded candor, attribute refusal any other cause than apprehension inconveniences attend the appointment. have the honor be, perfect respect, sir, most obedât servant, a. hamilton. general washington. p. s. have used the term brevet the sense excellency appears have understood in, signifying, general, all officers not attached any established corps. congress seem, however, have made a distinction: only give a kind warrant those whom designate brevet officers. a regular commission. le vicomte de noailles a hamilton. newport, 10 may, 1781. je suis certain, mon cher colonel, de vous faire plaisir en vous apprenant que votre ami laurens est arrivÃ© Ã  paris en bonne santÃ©, aprÃ¨s une traversÃ©e favorable. au dÃ©part de la frÃ©gate la concorde arrivÃ©e Ã  boston avec m. de barras amiral, qui vient prendre le commandement de notre flotte, et m. le vicomte de rochambau, mr. laurens avait dÃ©jÃ  eu plusieurs confÃ©rences avec nos ministres;

doubt whether some subsequent arrangement not take place a different appropriation. the commander-in-chief applied a quantity forage, which the legislature devising the means furnishing; fear finish diverting the eighteen thousand pounds purpose. have hitherto been able prevent this; indispensable importance leave this place immediately, prepare examination, which have pledged myself the ensuing term, which hand, possible, after have left it, contrary ideas prevail. efforts have been made introduce a species negotiable certificates, which have strenuously opposed. not yet taken place; am not clear the matter terminate. the bill the eighteen thousand pounds go out its present form, cannot hope produce the treasury above half the sum; such the vices our present mode collection. a bill also passed the assembly collecting arrearages taxes, payable specie, bank notes, notes; old continental emissions one hundred twenty-eight one, a species certificates issued the state the purchase horses. this now before the senate. the arrearages very large. both houses have unanimously passed a set resolutions, be transmitted congress the several states, proposing a convention the states, enlarge the powers congress vest funds. think this a very eligible step, though doubt the concurrence the other states; am certain, without it, never be brought co-operate any reasonable effectual plan. urge reforms, exertions, the answer constantly is, avails one state make without the concert the others? vain expose the futility this reasoning: founded all those passions which have the strongest influence the human mind. the legislature have also appointed, instance, a committee devise, its recess, a more effectual system taxation, communicate this subject. a good deal depend the success this attempt. convinced the absurdity multiplying taxes the present mode, where, effect, the payment voluntary, the money received exhausted the collection, have labored chiefly instil the necessity a change the plan;

although cannot name the citizen any state settle the accounts particular state, consistently the general line conduct have laid down myself; yet shall do, other respects, what my power. have not hitherto been able fix a proper commissioner the state new-york. the office vacant new hampshire rhode island. inclose a copy the ordinance the subject, may know the powers, duties, emoluments; have request offer these places colonel malcolm mr. lawrence. make the first offer, including the choice, own judgment may direct. the gentlemen, either them, accept, be kind give early notice. then immediately recommend the states respectively; receiving their approbation, the proper instructions, etc., can be expedited. am sorry learn any letter have given offence; conclude this effect must follow many parts my writings conduct; because the steady pursuit what appears be the true line duty, necessarily cross the various oblique views interest opinion. offend sometimes a fault, always a misfortune. the letter question is, suppose, under the date the eleventh december, which inclose a copy. let me, the same time, assure you, all excellent letter the thirteenth instant, most esteem the clause now question; because contains useful information which least common. make apologies the letter any one, because apologies rarely useful; the intention been good, are, candid minds, unnecessary. possessed the facts, can guard against misrepresentation; have ever found be the most hostile weapon which either my personal political enemies have been able wield against me. have not, _even yet_, seen the resolutions legislature relative an extension the powers congress. supposed the same reason which have expressed. indeed, power generally such a darling object weak minds, must feel extreme reluctance bid farewell; neither do believe any thing induce a general consent part it, a perfect sense absolute necessity. this may arise two sources; the one reason, the other feeling: the former more safe more uncertain; the latter always severe often dangerous. is, my dear sir, circumstances like this, a patriot mind, seeking the great good the whole, enlightened principles, can best be distinguished those vulgar souls whose narrow optics can see the little circle selfish concerns. unhappily, such souls too common, too often fill the seats dignity authority. a firm, wise, manly system federal government what once wished, what now hope, what dare not expect, what not despair of. description the mode collecting taxes, contains an epitome the follies which prevail one end the continent the other. there end the absurdity human nature. mankind seem delight contrast paradox; surely nothing else could sanctify (during a contest the precise point taxed our own consent) the arbitrary policy which, this subject, almost universally prevails. god grant success views amend it. ideas the subject perfectly correspondent my own. doubt the mode collecting it, wish obviate the observation, the farther off can remove the appointment collectors popular influence, the more effectual be their operations; the more conform the views congress, the more effectually enable body provide general defence. political life, the creature generally pay some deference both. the a double set officers indeed an evil; a good thing not always be rejected because necessary portion evil which, the course things, must be attached it. neither this a necessary evil; for, a proper federal government, army, navy, revenue, the civil administration well be provided a stamp act, roads turnpikes, navigations tolls. the account give the state means flattering: the more true appears, the more concern gives me. the loan, hope, be completed; wish the _whole_ amount the tax may be collected. the forage plan have disagreed to; inclose, information, the copy my letter, subject, the quartermaster general. believe state exhausted: perhaps even consider more than is. the certificates, which now form a useless load, (if the united states adopt, the several states agree to, a plan now before congress) become valuable property. this afford great relief. the scarcity money, also, may be immediately relieved, the love popular favor far give way the love public good, enforce plentiful taxation. the necessity money always produce money. the desire it, produces, see, much necessary gratify the desire enjoying foreign luxuries. turn the stream, which now flows the channels commerce, those revenue, the business completed. unfortunately us, this an operation which requires fortitude, perseverance, virtue; which cannot be effected the weak wicked minds who have only partial, private, interested views. consider the exertions which the country possess already made, under striking disadvantages, astonishing prodigality national wealth, pernicious modes applying it; persuade myself, regular, consistent efforts, produce much more than suppose. * * * * * am, perfect respect, most obedient humble servant, robert morris. alexander hamilton, esq. hamilton robert morris. albany, august 31, 1782. sir: send herewith all the acts the legislature this state since the government been organized; the margin which have numbered all the acts relative the matters mention letter july, â81, the states agreeable the within list. inclose the papers the last week. the indolence some, the repugnancy others, make every trifle lag much the execution, am not able this time give any further information. wish hear the subject my former letters previous the meeting the committee--the 15th the ensuing month. have the honor be very truly, sir, most obedient servant, a. h. the honorable superintendent finance. governor clinton hamilton. poughkeepsie, september 2, 1782. sir: am favored letter the 25th instant, previous which, a view accelerating the collection the last tax, prepared, have since dispatched a circular letter the several county treasurers, urging the other officers concerned, a prompt execution their duty, case neglect the penalty the law without favor be put into execution. have not received information all the counties, this some others, know the business good train, am led hope the taxes be speedily collected paid in. my agents employed procure moneys loan some time since transmitted a small sum, not sufficient answer the orders the legislature favor the delegates some other public matters. the channel through which this money procured subject interruption disappointment, cannot present inform any sum be depended on, expect soon see hear the gentlemen, may rest assured informed the result without delay. am, great respect esteem, sir, most obedient servant, geo. clinton. col. hamilton. hamilton the county treasurers. albany, september 7, 1782. sir: the fifteenth this month the period fixed the payment the tax imposed the last meeting the legislature the use the united states. the public exigencies, the reputation the state, require every exertion should be made collect this tax punctuality dispatch; is, therefore, my duty urge you, employ the powers vested you, all personal influence, induce the collectors expedite the collection all the zeal vigor their power. while the other states all doing something, a citizen this, shall feel a sensible mortification obliged continue publishing the others, this state pays nothing support the war, have been under the necessity doing the last two months. besides this, other still more weighty considerations, a regard the subjects the state itself demands every exertion our power. have parted their property the public faith, impossible the public fulfil its engagements individuals, unless enabled do the equal just contributions the community large. am, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. hamilton morris. albany, september 7, 1782. sir: have the inclosed ready some time; hopes receiving the returns the certificates mentioned memorandum b, delayed sending the present sketch. even received answers some the parties, who live a distance me, suspect have done their business disorderly a manner (to say nothing worse it) a loss render the accounts; have, therefore, concluded not detain any longer what have procured. do not take the step mentioned memorandum a, because doubted its propriety. raise expectations about the old money, which, possibly, may not enter into plans raise: and, besides this, knowing what been called in, each state (which the sketch send you, appear this), can determine the balance emissions remaining out, except what may have worn out been accidentally destroyed. desire this step be taken, obey commands. have said nothing the rates depreciation, because imagine letter, written july, â80, reference the rates which the money then actually circulating, the circulation now totally ceased. the laws sent the last post, inform the rates fixed different periods the legislature: forty, seventy-five, lastly, one hundred twenty-eight. am obliged infer there a studied backwardness the officers the state, who ought give the information require respecting the supplies different kinds which have been furnished the use the united states. indeed, find, inquiry, their joint information not be full satisfy intentions; this cannot be done till have appointed a commissioner accounts, authorized enter into all the details, aided some legislative arrangement which may be obtained the next session. have the honor be, great respect esteem, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. robert morris, esq. hamilton timothy pickering. albany, september 7, 1782. dear sir: this day received letter the 20th august. mr. morris advised the bills describe, directed my purchasing them, together his notes, the bank notes; what money shall come into my hands public account. now beginning collect the tax imposed the use the united states, though can yet form judgment what success expedition. shall pleasure give the information ask, rather wish be excused anticipation previous deposits my hands, some measure pledge give a preference the bills deposited, may hereafter expose a charge partiality. there have been several applications a similar anticipation which have avoided; reserving myself the power paying the bills shall be presented, proportion the nearness remoteness the periods payments. may, however, depend shall be happy assist department, keep view present request. hope, towards the latter end the month, shall receive something considerable the late tax. am, dear sir, very truly, obedient servant, a. hamilton. timothy pickering, d. q. gen. hamilton robert morris. albany, sept. 14, 1782. sir: have the honor acknowledge the receipt letter the 29th august, the contents which shall be executed. have just received the post accounts the specific supplies furnished the state; copies which shall prepare be transmitted the next post, am return the originals, which the inspection the legislature. hope add these accounts the moneys supplied. have written a number letters since my journey poughkeepsie, which, contain some things a confidential nature, am not without anxiety learn the safe arrival. should also have been happy have received instructions against the meeting the committee, which take place to-morrow. have other business, hear the next post, shall not be too late. am a loss know whether ought press the establishment permanent _funds_ not; though unless receive instructions, following my own apprehensions what probably views, shall dwell this article. have the honor be, perfect respect, sir, most obât servât, a. hamilton. inclose a copy a letter the governor, the 2d inst., which see his hopes. mine not good. this vicinity, always delinquent, little doing. hamilton robert morris. albany, sept. 21, 1782. sir: the hurry which wrote the last post, prevented my examining particularly the papers which informed received. a more careful inspection them, found not so complete hoped. there a general state specific supplies; the returns referred the particulars, some mistake omitted. have written them, have not yet arrived; do, shall lose time forwarding them. observe there nothing respecting transportation; there a part the supplies the period before col. hay came into office, which estimated a scale proportion--too vague a method be satisfactory. have urged him send an account the transportation, collect, speedily possible, official returns the supplies above mentioned. there a practice obtaining which appears contravene views. the contractors, am informed, have gotten into a method carrying bills immediately the collectors drawing the specie out their hands, which means the paper never goes into circulation all; passes, so speak, immediately out one hand the public into the other. the people, therefore, can never be familiarized the paper, nor can ever obtain a general currency. the specie come into the receiversâ hands, the contractors left under a necessity exerting their influence induce the inhabitants take notes, be afterwards redeemed the receivers agreeably plan, this gradually accustom the people place confidence the notes; though the circulation first should be momentary, come be more permanent. am doubt, whether the mere speculation an evil, without instructions, ought take any step prevent this practice. for, should forbid the exchange, possibly cause a suspicion there a preference the paper the specie, which injure its credit. have thought a method prevent, without forbidding direct terms. this require each collector return the names the persons whom he received taxes, different columns, specify the kind money, whether specie, notes, bank notes, which the tax paid; giving the inhabitants receipts accordingly; paying money the same species which received. this cover the object. have tried prevail upon the county treasurer this place, instruct the collectors accordingly; the great aim all these people avoid trouble; he affected consider the matter a herculean labor. nor be done without a legislative injunction. a method this kind tend much check fraud the collectors; have many good consequences. thought my duty, any rate, apprise the practice, that, my apprehensions right, may not be continued without control. have reason believe very extensive--by means confined this state. permit make one more observation. notes, though credit the merchants way remittance, do not enter far into ordinary circulation, this principally account their size; which even makes inconvenient paying taxes. the taxes very few amount twenty dollars a single tax; though the farmers combine sell their produce the notes, pay the taxes jointly; yet this not always convenient, seldom be practised. the notes were, considerable part, five, eight, ten dollars, their circulation be far more general; the merchants would, even their retail operations, give specie exchange balances; which few care do, can do, the larger notes; though willing take their goods. a. hamilton. hamilton morris. september 28, 1782. sir: have been honored this week letters the twenty-eighth august, the sixth, twelfth, seventeenth instant, their inclosures. gives the most real pleasure find my past communications have met approbation; feel a particular satisfaction the friendly confidence which letters manifest. am persuaded substantial reasons have determined choice a particular instance doctor tillotson; am flattered the attention have obligingly paid my recommendations colonel malcolm mr. lawrence. those gentlemen now here. make the warmest acknowledgments offer, decline leaving the state; which, indeed, not compatible the present prospects either them. am glad have an opportunity perusing letter this state, which so much exception been taken; because confirmed what presumed, there been much unjustifiable ill-humor upon the occasion. make use the knowledge have combat misrepresentation. the twenty-ninth july congress, full principles arguments luminous conclusive. be lamented have not more weight than infer the momentary expedient adopted the resolutions the fourth tenth; which will, alone, not be satisfactory the public creditors; fear only tend embarrass present operations, without answering the end view. the more see, the more find reason those who love this country weep over its blindness. the committee the subject taxation met. some have their plans; must protect their own children, however misshapen: others have none; determined find fault all. expect little, shall promote any thing, though imperfect, mend our situation. sentiments the greatest respect esteem, have the honor be, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. p.s. the public creditors this quarter, have a meeting, appointed a committee devise measures. the committee report petitions congress the legislature; an address the public creditors other parts the state, appoint persons meet convention, unite some common measure. believe also propose a general convention all the creditors the different states. a. h. the hon. robert morris, esq. hamilton morris. albany, oct. 5, 1782. sir: my last informed you, the committee, appointed the legislature the subject taxation, together. spite my efforts, have parted without doing any thing decisive. have, indeed, agreed upon several matters, those importance; have not reduced the form a report; which, fact, leaves every thing afloat, be governed the impressions the moment, the legislature meets. the points agreed upon, these: there shall be an actual valuation land, a tax so much the pound. the great diversity the qualities land not suffer listen an estimated valuation, a tax the quantity, agreeably the idea late report congress. there shall be also a tariff all personal property, be also taxed so much the pound; there shall be a specific tax carriages, clocks, watches, other similar articles luxury; money, usury, shall be taxed a fixed rate the pound, excluding which loaned the public; houses, all towns, shall be taxed a certain proportion the annual rent; there shall be a poll tax all single men fifteen upwards; the collection the taxes should be advertised the lowest bidder, a fixed rate per cent., bearing all subordinate expenses. among other things which rejected, pressed hard an excise distilled liquors; all could be carried this article a license taverns. the committee pretty generally opinion, the system funding payment old debts, procuring further credit, wise indispensable; a majority thought be unwise one state contribute this way alone. nothing decided the quantum taxes which the state able pay: those who went furthest, did not exceed seventy thousand pounds, which fifty the use the united states. send my cash account, which what been received this county. have not heard the others. have the honor be, sir, most obedient servant, a. hamilton. the hon. robert morris, esq. morris hamilton. office finance, october 5, 1782. sir: have now before letters the fourteenth twenty-first last month. am sorry find less sanguine pecuniary expectations than the governor appears be; have always found the worst forebodings this subject the truest. find, the bottom this letter, a list all those which have hitherto received you. think have all been already acknowledged; lest should not, will see one moment, the list, whether any have miscarried. am not surprised find the contractors apply their paper, the first instance, the receivers collectors. this expected, because much paper not fit other purposes. some it, however, which payable the bearer, calculated circulation; which observe not so general otherwise have been, reason the largeness the sums expressed the notes. mr. duerâs letters contain the same sentiment. issuing this paper, one principal view facilitate the payment taxes obviating the too general (though unjust) complaint the want a circulating medium. substituting paper specie, the first obstacle be encountered, the total diffidence which arisen the late profusion it. a considerable quantity been thrown into the hands class the people, whose ideas the subject money, more the offspring habit than reason, must have depreciated. this apprehension just, clear this fact, the paper first issued, the bank paper which came out after it, did depreciate ten fifteen per cent. the eastern states, notwithstanding all the precautions which used. not taken immediate measures create a demand the spot, stop issues quarter, its credit have been totally lost a time, not easily restored. besides that, the quantities which pouring thence have done mischief here. confidence a plant very slow growth; our political situation not too favorable it. am, therefore, very unwilling hazard the germ a credit, which will, its greater maturity, become very useful. my notes circulate only among mercantile people, do not regret it, rather wish the circulation may, the present, be confined them, the wealthier members other professions. nothing the greater convenience, which will induce people prefer any kind paper the precious metals; this convenience principally felt large sums. whenever the shopkeepers, general, discover my paper will answer a remittance the principal ports, will be readily exchanged the receivers, will readily exchange other people. the people, general, find the shopkeepers receive freely, will begin look after it, not before. must know, whatever fine plausible speeches may be made this subject, the farmers will not give full credit money, merely because will pay taxes: an object not very violently devoted to. money which goes freely the store the tavern, will be sought after greedily those things which the store the tavern contain. still, however, objection remains good; the traffickings which the greater part the community engage, do not require sums so large twenty dollars. this shall readily acknowledge: will observe there infinitely less danger large notes, which go only through the hands intelligent people, will be counterfeited than small ones, which come the possession illiterate men. public credit firmly established, the little shocks receives the counterfeiters paper money, do not lead material consequences; but, the present ticklish state things, there just ground apprehension. besides this, the value paper will depend much upon the interchanges specie: these will not take place there a circulation small paper. lastly, have observe, until more reliance can be placed the revenues required, dare not issue any very considerable amount this paper, lest should be run upon more than could answer: the circulation what dare issue, increasing the general mass, enables people (so far goes) more easily get hold other money, consequently produces, its degree, object facilitating taxation which view. am, sir, most obedient, humble servant, robert morris. alexander hamilton, esq., receiver new-york. hamilton de noailles. 1782. esteem talents acquirements a sentiment which, my earliest acquaintance you, my dear viscount, have shared common all those who have the happiness knowing you; a better knowledge character given it, my eyes, a more intrinsic merit, attached a friendship founded upon qualities rare estimable. averse am professions, cannot forbear indulging this declaration, express the pleasure felt receiving (after an inexplicable delay) the letter so obliging write before departure boston. kind which always produced those attentions friends value;

while this the plan, will not evacuate posts so essential points departure; whence, any favorable turn affairs, renew their attack our most vulnerable side. nor will relinquish objects be so useful them, should the worst happen a final negotiation. clinton, said, cutting a canal across new-york island, through the low grounds, about a mile a half the city. this will be an additional obstacle;

revived, some measure, the public credit; conciliating fast the support the moneyed men. his operations have hitherto hinged chiefly the seasonable aids country; he urging the establishment permanent funds among ourselves: though, the nature temper our governments, his applications will meet a dilatory compliance, be hoped will degrees succeed. the institution a bank been very serviceable him: the commercial interest, finding great advantages it, anticipating much greater, disposed promote the plan; nothing moderate funds, permanently pledged the security lenders, wanting make an engine the most extensive solid utility. the last advices there reason believe the delinquent states will shortly comply the requisition congress a duty our imports. this will be a great resource mr. morris; will not alone be sufficient. upon the whole, however, the war continues another year, will be necessary congress should again recur the generosity france pecuniary assistance. the plans the financier cannot be so matured enable us, any possibility, dispense this; he should fail want support, must replunge into confusion distress which like have proved fatal us, out which slowly emerging. the cure, a relapse, be infinitely more difficult than ever. have given an uninteresting a faithful sketch our situation. may expect, time time, receive the progress our affairs;

am not without hope, properly improved, may be the mean leading a just favorable issue. the idea many the military being interested the independency vermont, consequence their taken grants lands under them, believe without foundation. there a period the disposition congress, founded political expedience, appeared so favorable the independence district, have induced some gentlemen the army apply the usurped government grants. discovered intriguing the common enemy, the more respectable characters withdrew their applications, relinquished all kind connection them; even those who did not go so far, imagine conceive themselves perfectly secure under our late acts. if, however, this should not be the case, any difficulty which may be apprehended may be easily obviated; am persuaded the legislature disposed every liberal act may consist the honor the state, tend facilitate a settlement the dispute. there a time, not long since, congress only have spoken decisively the subject, would have been obeyed: nor do believe the time yet past, could be convinced congress earnest. force necessary carry their decision into execution, the longer delayed the more force will require. the misfortune is, though believe there few states favor their independence, some members those who do, take great pains encourage the revolters their opposition, secret assurances congress will not direct any coercive measures against them: am not without my fears this conduct will, some measure, defeat the present resolutions. am, great respect esteem, dear sir, your most obedient servant, george clinton. the hon. alexander hamilton, esq. la fayette hamilton. (most private.) cadix, feb. 5, 1783. your friendship me, my dear sir, the affection have you, command my most _confidential_ communications. public affairs have the first place me, let tell our articles confederation ought be revised, measures immediately taken invigorate the continental union; depend upon it, there lies the danger america; this last stroke wanting, unless the states be strongly bound each other, have much fear british, and, indeed, european politics. there ought be delegates each state, perhaps some officers among them, one whom would be happy be, who, toward next fall, would meet together, under the presidence general washington, may devise upon amendments be proposed the articles confederation--limits states, &c., &c., &c. the army, hope their country will be grateful, hope the half pay affair may be terminated their satisfaction. now, my dear sir, am going torment my private concerns. first all, wish the people america know that, have lengthened my furlough, their service, the request their commissioners; upon my embarking a fresh expedition, a view join the summer, forces adequate every plan general washington had directed promote; that, moreover, a canadian expedition take place; then, instead sending a vessel, going myself america. entreaties your residence madrid have forced go there, probably there paris; the month june, am embark america. confess, my dear sir, have a great value my american popularity, want the people large know my affection my zeal their service. the best way manage have a resolve congress published, way answer my letters, wherein their approbation my conduct will comprehend the above mentioned matters. there another thing which would highly flatter me, lies within your department; a ratification the treaty will be sent congress the court england; an honorary commission, requires only a few weeks, even a few daysâ attendance. the sedentary minister may send, me, after me, or, what would like better, the time great britain sent you. so many greater proofs confidence have been bestowed upon congress, may truly tell my wishes upon this very pleasing mark their esteem. upon my leaving england, have been considered there an enthusiastic rebel, and, indeed, a young madman. would well enough like present myself there the capacity an extraordinary envoy the united states; though upon my committing so far the french ambassador, have been him pretty bad terms; now our friendship revived, am a situation lead him into my measures, know his secrets without telling him mine. the choice a minister, (this commission being only a compliment,) think a very difficult task. advise take a gentleman who had connection the great men england; our friend hamilton would be a very proper choice; ought bring about. acquainted col. harrison, who the generalâs family; there few men so honest sensible; hope may send hamilton, he knows better than all the british councils. case congress pleased do what have so much heart, would beg send mr. mchenry me, a member the maryland senate. this, my dear sir, entirely confidential you, _for alone_; should the general be philadelphia, may show him. adieu. my best respects wait upon your lady family. most affectionately, am yours, la fayette. should think any use have printed the last paragraph my letter congress, will be glad it, the opinion one who knows europe may have some weight the people. hamilton washington. philadelphia, february 7, 1788. sir: flattering myself your knowledge will induce receive the observations make, dictated a regard the public good, take the liberty suggest my ideas some matters delicacy importance. view the present juncture a very interesting one. need not observe far the temper situation the army make so. the state our finances perhaps never more critical. am under injunctions which will not permit disclose some facts would once demonstrate this position; think probable will be possessed through another channel. is, however, certain, there scarcely been a period the revolution which called more wisdom decision congress. unfortunately us, a body not governed reason foresight, circumstances. probable shall not take the proper measures; do not, a few months may open an embarrassing scene. this will be the case, whether have peace a continuance the war. the war continues, would seem the army must, june, subsist itself, _to defend the country_. peace should take place, _will_ subsist itself, _to procure justice itself_. appears be a prevailing opinion the army, the disposition recompense their services, will cease the necessity them; once lay down their arms, part the means obtaining justice. be lamented appearances afford too much ground their distrust. becomes a serious inquiry, what the true line policy? the claims the army, urged moderation, firmness, may operate those weak minds which influenced their apprehensions more than their judgments, so produce a concurrence the measures which the exigencies affairs demand. may add weight the applications congress the several states. so far a useful turn may be given them. the difficulty will be, keep a _complaining_ _suffering army_ within the bounds moderation. this your excellencyâs influence must effect. order it, will be advisable not discountenance their endeavors procure redress, rather, the intervention confidential prudent persons, _to take the direction them_. this, however, must not appear. moment the public tranquillity, your excellency should preserve the confidence the army without losing the people. this will enable you, case extremity, guide the torrent, bring order, perhaps even good, out confusion. âtis a part requires address; âtis one which your own situation, well the welfare the community, points out. will not conceal your excellency a truth which necessary should know. an idea propagated the army, delicacy, carried an extreme, prevents your espousing its interests sufficient warmth. the falsehood this opinion one can be better acquainted than myself; not the less mischievous being false. its tendency impair influence which may exert advantage, should any commotions unhappily ensue, moderate the pretensions the army, make their conduct correspond their duty. the great _desideratum_ present, the establishment general funds, which alone can do justice the creditors the united states (of whom the army forms the most meritorious class), restore public credit, supply the future wants government. this the object all men sense. this, the influence the army, properly directed, may co-operate. the intimations have thrown out, will suffice give your excellency a proper conception my sentiments. will judge their reasonableness fallacy; persuade myself will do justice my motives. have the honor be, great respect, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, alex. hamilton. general knox the confidence the army, a man sense. think he may be safely made use of. situated am, your excellency will feel the confidential nature these observations. his excellency general washington. duane hamilton. newburgh, 17th february, 1783. dear sir: am now a visit the general kingston, the legislature convened. the british kingâs speech----to his parliament, his secretaryâs letters the lord mayor london, which had the pleasure meeting here, afford the fairest prospect a speedy peace. have one anxiety remaining, respects a better establishment our general government a basis will secure the permanent union the states, a punctual payment the public debts. do not think our legislature will be averse a reasonable system. the assembly have agreed the requisitions congress, press the arrears taxes; a joint committee both houses have taken measures compel the immediate production the accounts all who have been intrusted public money. this last step became so necessary, found no difficulty getting adopted. would even hazard an attempt introduce an intendant, had proper materials; am disappointed not receiving the maryland plan, which promised mr. wright mr. homsly. possible, still wish would forward this act this subject, the collection taxes. the example a state may be adopted, any plan my own be rejected. there such confusion the present administration our state finances, the weight our debts so burthensome, a remedy must be provided; apprehend the production the public accounts, before alluded to, will furnish sufficient arguments prove its necessity. want the report, the evidence arguments support our territorial rights. if, proposed, have taken the trouble copy it, be so obliging transmit your copy. should your leisure not have been sufficient the undertaking, be pleased get transcribed forwarded. a collection great importance the state, should be lost, do not know who would submit the labor a second effort. general schuyler sent a week ago pay the last duties your grandfather. he wrote the tenth, there no hopes his surviving many days, learn he still living four days ago, without the least prospect recovery. your known punctuality, take granted have written agreeably your promise, your letters have miscarried. any communication, while the legislature convened, would be peculiarly acceptable, probably useful. be pleased present my respectful compliments colonel floyd, mrs. hamilton, mr. mrs. carter, the gentlemen our family, etc. the utmost regard, remain, dear sir, your affectionate most obedient humble servant, jas. duane. colonel alexander hamilton. hamilton governor clinton. february, 24, 1783 sir: my letter the fourteenth informed your excellency, congress employed devising a plan carrying the eighth article the confederation into execution. this business length brought a conclusion. inclose, the information the legislature, the proceedings upon different stages, which will see the part have acted. ultimately left a small minority, think my duty explain the motives upon which my opposition the general course the house founded. am opinion, the article the confederation itself ill-judged. the first place, do not believe there any general representative the wealth a nation, the criterion its ability pay taxes. there only two can be thought of, _land_ _numbers_. the revenues the united provinces (general particular) computed, before the present war, more than half much those great britain. the extent their territory not one-fourth part great; their population less than a third. the comparison still more striking between those provinces the swiss cantons; both which, extent territory population nearly the same; yet the revenues the former five times large those the latter; nor could any efforts taxation bring any thing like a level. both cases, the advantages agriculture superior those countries which afford least revenue proportion. have selected these examples because most familiar; whoever will extend the comparison between the nations the world, will perceive the position have laid down supported universal experience. the truth is, the ability a country pay taxes depends infinite combinations physical moral causes, which can never be accommodated any general rule; climate, soil, productions, advantages navigation, government, genius the people, progress arts industry, an endless variety circumstances. the diversities sufficiently great, these states, make an infinite difference their relative wealth; the proportion which can never be found any common measure whatever. the only possible way, then, making contribute the general expense, an equal proportion their means, general taxes imposed under continental authority. this mode, there would, no doubt, be inequalities, and, a considerable time, material ones; experience, the constant operation a general interest, which, the very collision particular interests, must, the main, prevail a continental deliberative, would length correct those inequalities, balance one tax should bear hard upon one state, another should have proportional weight others. this idea, however, not, the period framing the confederation, not yet, agreeable the spirit the time. futurity must leave the discovery, far this spirit wise foolish. one thing only now certain; congress, the discretionary power determining the quantum money be paid into the general treasury towards defraying the common expenses, have, effect, the constitutional power general taxation. the restraints upon the exercise this power, amount perpetuating a rule fixing the proportions, which must necessity produce inequality, and, refusing the federal government a power specific taxation collection, without substituting any other adequate means coercion, do, fact, leave the compliance continental requisitions the good will the respective states. inequality inherent the theory the confederation; and, the practice, inequality must increase proportion the honesty dishonesty the component parts. this vice will either, its consequences, reform the federal constitution, dissolve it. a general standard must be fixed, numbers preferable land. modes be devised ascertain the former tolerable precision; am persuaded the experiment will prove, the value all the land each state cannot be ascertained any thing like exactness. both these measures have the common disadvantage being no equal representative the wealth the people; one much more simple, definite, certain than the other. have indulged myself these remarks, show have little expectation success any mode carrying the article question into execution upon equitable principles. owe it, however, myself, declare, my opposition did not arise this source. the confederation pointed out this mode; and, though would heartily join a representation the difficulties (of which every man sense must be sensible examination) occur the execution the plan, induce the states consent a change, yet, this not the disposition a majority congress, would have assented any mode attempting which not either obviously mischievous impracticable. the first plan proposed, your excellency will see, an actual valuation each state itself. this evidently making the interested party judge his own cause. those who have seen the operation this principle between the counties the same state, the districts the same county, cannot doubt a moment the valuations this plan would have been altogether unequal unjust. without supposing more liberality one state than another, the degree care, judgment, method, employed the execution, would alone make extreme differences the results. this mode has, also, the further inconvenience awakening all the jealousies the several states against each other. each would suspect its neighbor had favored itself, whether the partiality appeared not. would be impossible silence these distrusts, make the states sit down satisfied the justice each other. every new requisition money would be a new signal discussion clamor; the seeds disunion, already sown too thick, would not be a little multiplied. guard against these evils, the plan proposes a revision congress; easy be seen such a power could not be exercised. should any states return defective valuations, would be difficult find sufficient evidence determine such. alter would not be admissible; congress could have no data which could be presumed equivalent those which must have governed the judgment commissioners under oath, an actual view the premises. do either this, reject, would be an impeachment the honor the states, which not probable there would be decision enough hazard; which, done, could not fail excite serious disgusts. there a wide difference between a single state exercising such a power over its own counties, a confederated government exercising over sovereign states which compose the confederacy. also happen, too many states would be interested the defective valuations, leave a sufficient number willing, either alter reject. these considerations prevailed prevent the plan being adopted a majority. the last plan may be less mischievous than the first; appears altogether ineffectual. the mere quantity land granted surveyed, the general species buildings upon them, can certainly be no criteria determine their value. the plan not even distinguish the improved the unimproved land; the qualities soil, degrees improvement: the quantities the houses other buildings, entirely omitted. these, seems, be judged the commissioners be appointed each state. am unable conceive, any commissioner can form the least estimate these circumstances respect even his own state, much less respect other states, which would be necessary establish a just relative value. even there a distinction improved unimproved land, supposing an intrinsic value the land, adopting general rates, something nearer the truth be attained; must now be all conjecture uncertainty. the numbers inhabitants, distinguishing white black, called for. this not only totally foreign the confederation, can answer no reasonable purpose. been said, the proportion numbers may guide correct the estimates. an assertion, purely verbal, no meaning. a judgment must first be formed the value the lands upon some principles. this should be altered the proportion numbers, plain numbers would be substituted land. another objection this plan is, lets the particular interests the states, operate the returns the quantities land, number buildings, number inhabitants. the principle this objection applies less forcibly here than against the former plan. whoever will consider the plain import the eighth article the confederation, must be convinced, intended an _actual_ _specific_ valuation land, buildings, improvements, not a mere general estimate, according the present plan. while insist, therefore, upon adhering the confederation, should do reality, not barely appearance. many those who voted this scheme, had bad an opinion myself; induced accede it, a persuasion some plan the purpose expected the states; none better, the present circumstances the country, could be fallen upon. a leading rule which have laid down the direction my conduct, this: while would have a just deference the expectations the states, would never consent amuse attempts which must either fail the execution, be productive evil. would rather incur the negative inconveniences delay than the positive mischiefs injudicious expedients. a contrary conduct serves destroy confidence the government, the greatest misfortune can befall a nation. there should, my opinion, be a character wisdom efficiency all the measures the federal council, the opposite a spirit temporizing concession. would have sufficient reliance the judgments the several states, hope good reasons not attempting a thing, would be more satisfactory than precipitate fruitless attempts. my idea is, that, taking granted the states will expect an experiment the principle the confederation, the best plan will be make commissioners appointed congress, acting under their authority. congress might, the first instance, appoint three more the principal characters each state probity abilities, a power nominate other commissioners under them, each subdivision the state. general principles be laid down the regulation their conduct, which uniformity the manner conducting the business would obtain. sanctions such solemnity be prescribed, such notoriety given every part the transaction, the commissioners could neither be careless nor partial without a sacrifice reputation. carry this plan, however, into effect, sufficient care accuracy, would be a work both time expense; and, unfortunately, so pressed find money calls immediate necessity, could not, present, undertake a measure which would require so large a sum. appears evident, every part a business which so important universal concern, should be transacted uniform principles, under the direction _body_ which a common interest. general, regard the present moment, probably the dawn peace, peculiarly critical; the measures which shall produce, great importance the future welfare these states. am, therefore, scrupulously cautious assenting plans which appear founded false principles. your excellency will observe, the valuation the lands be the standard adjusting the accounts, past supplies, between the united states the particular states. this, adhered to, without allowance the circumstances those states which have been more immediately the theatre the war, will charge our state the past, according its _future ability_, an entire condition, the valuation should be made after regain possession the parts the state now the power the enemy. have heretofore introduced a motion repeating the call, a more earnest manner, upon the states, vest congress a power making equitable abatements, agreeably the spirit the resolution the twentieth february last, which few the states have complied with. this motion been committed. know not what will be its fate. notwithstanding the opposition have given, now the matter been decided congress, hope the state will cheerfully comply what required. unless each state governed this principle, there an end the union. every state will, no doubt, have a right, this case, accompany its compliance such remarks may think proper. have the honor be, your excellencyâs most obât servant, a. hamilton. p. s. after the plan agreed upon, committed be put into form; and, reported, instead commissioners, an alteration carried making the estimate a grand committee. february 27. mr. morris signified congress, his resolution resign the first june, adequate funds not time provided. this will be a severe stroke our affairs. no man, fit the office, will be willing supply his place, the very reason he resigns. âtis happy have reasons expect a peace. am sorry that, different accounts, appears not have been concluded late december. his excellency governor clinton. governor clinton hamilton. kingston, february 24, 1783. sir: have been honored your letter the twelfth january. may remember, july last, submitted the consideration our legislature, certain resolutions the assembly new hampshire, making overtures an amicable settlement a boundary line between the two states; which read committed: the session short, devoted principally the particular business which convened, no determination had the subject. had some reason expect a consideration these resolutions would have taken place the present meeting. this induced defer answering your letter until could inform the result. cannot, however, discover any disposition take up this business. seems be the prevailing opinion, congress engaged make a final decision the controversy respecting the district called the grants, a partial compromise the matter would be improper; any measures the purpose, alienate the affections our most zealous subjects quarter, be attended other dangerous consequences. besides, doubts exist whether the legislature have authority, any act theirs, consent such a dismemberment the state would probably be insisted upon, a compromise new hampshire. am, nevertheless, still persuaded, should congress determine the summit the mountains be the boundary between the two states, this state (whatever our sentiments be the equity the decision) would, the sake peace, submit it: there cannot be a doubt, new hampshire would be perfectly satisfied the jurisdiction so extensive valuable a territory. take granted, that, whatever may be the decision, equitable measures will be adopted securing the property individuals. congratulate you, most sincerely, the promising prospects peace. pray nothing may prevent the desirable event soon taking place. our friends the city, long island, anxiously wait the moment which may return their homes. the expectations all so much raised obstruct public business not a little. please offer my best respects mrs. hamilton, believe me, great respect esteem, sir, your most obedient servant, geo. clinton. p. s. great concern mention, since writing the above, am informed the death your relation, colonel john van rensselaer. he departed this life friday last. general schuyler, who sent his recovery despaired of, set out albany his return this place wednesday next. g. c. alexander hamilton, esq. washington hamilton. newburgh, march 4, 1783. dear sir: have received your favor february, thank the information observations conveyed me. shall always think myself obliged a free communication sentiments, have often thought (but suppose thought wrong, did not accord the practice congress), the public interest be benefited, the commander-in-chief the army let more into the political pecuniary state our affairs than he is. enterprises, the adoption military other arrangements be exceedingly proper some circumstances, would be altogether improper others. follows, then, fair deduction, there a want information, there must be chance-medley; a man may be upon the brink a precipice before he aware his danger, a little foreknowledge enable him avoid it. this the by. the hint contained your letter, the knowledge have derived the public gazettes, respecting the non-payment taxes, contain all the information have received the danger stares the face account our funds; so far conceiving our finances so deplorable a state, _at this time_, had imbibed ideas some source other, that, the prospect a loan holland, should be able rub along. you, who have seen the danger which the army been exposed a political dissolution want subsistence, the unhappy spirit licentiousness which imbibed becoming, one two instances, its own proveditors, no observations necessary evince the fatal tendency such a measure; shall give my opinion, would this day be productive civil commotions end blood. unhappy situation this! god forbid should be involved it. the predicament which stand, citizen soldier, critical delicate can well be conceived. been the subject many contemplative hours. the sufferings a complaining army one hand, the inability congress, tardiness the states the other, the forebodings evil, may be productive events which more be deprecated than prevented: am not without hope, there such a disposition shown prudence policy dictate, do justice, your apprehensions, case peace, greater than there cause for. this, however, may be mistaken, those ideas which have been informed propagated the army, should be extensive, the source which may be easily traced; the old leaven, _it said_, have no proof it, again beginning work, under the mask the most perfect dissimulation apparent cordiality. be these things may, shall pursue the same steady line conduct which governed hitherto; fully convinced, the sensible discerning part the army cannot be unacquainted (although never took pains inform them) the services have rendered more occasions than one. this, pursuing the suggestions your letter, which am happy find coincide my own practice several months past, which the means directing the business the army into the channel now is, leave under no _great_ apprehension its exceeding the bounds reason moderation; notwithstanding the prevailing sentiment the army is, the prospect compensation past services will terminate the war. the just claims the army ought, be hoped will, have their weight every sensible legislature the union, congress point their demands; show (if the case so) the reasonableness them; the impracticability complying without their aid. any other point view, would, my opinion, be impolitic introduce the army the tapis, lest should excite jealousy bring its concomitants. the states cannot, surely, be so devoid common sense, common honesty, common policy, refuse their aid, a full, clear, candid representation facts congress; more especially, these should be enforced members their own body, who demonstrate what the inevitable consequences failure must lead to. my opinion a matter worthy consideration, far an adjournment congress a few months advisable. the delegates, case, unison themselves respecting the great defects their constitution, may represent fully boldly their constituents. me, who know nothing the business which before congress, nor the arcanum, appears such a measure would tend promote the public weal: clearly my opinion, unless congress have powers competent all _general_ purposes, the distresses have encountered, the expenses have incurred, the blood have spilt, the course an eight yearsâ war, will avail nothing. the contents your letter known only myself; your prudence will direct what should be done this. great esteem regard, am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton, esq. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 5, 1783. sir: had the honor writing your excellency lately a very confidential subject, shall be anxious know, soon convenient, whether the letter got safe hand. the bearer, shattuck, thinks he can point out means apprehending wells knowlton, the two persons whom your excellency authorized have taken into custody. have desired him call upon disclose the plan. will not trouble your excellency any observation the importance getting hold those persons. the surmise mr. arnold, a member congress, gave intelligence the design take them, makes peculiarly important. have the honor be, your excellencyâs most obât servât, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. washington hamilton. newburgh, march 12, 1783. dear sir: wrote last, a state tranquillity; after the arrival a certain gentleman, who shall be nameless present, philadelphia, a storm very suddenly arose, unfavorable prognostics; which, though diverted a moment, not yet blown over; nor my power point the issue. the papers which send officially congress, will supersede the necessity my remarking the tendency them. the notification address, both, appeared the same instant, the day preceding the intended meeting. the first these got hold the same afternoon; the other not till next morning. there something very mysterious this business. appears reports have been propagated philadelphia, dangerous combinations forming the army; this a time there not a syllable the kind agitation camp. also appears, upon the arrival camp the gentleman above alluded to, such sentiments these immediately circulated: universally expected the army would not disband until had obtained justice; the public creditors looked up redress their own grievances; would afford every aid, even join the field, necessary; some members congress wished the measure take effect, order compel the public, particularly the delinquent states, do justice; many other suggestions a similar nature. this, a variety other considerations, firmly believed _some_, the scheme not only planned, also digested matured, philadelphia;[19] my opinion shall be suspended till have better ground found one on. the matter managed great art; soon the minds the officers thought be prepared the transaction, the anonymous invitations addresses the officers put circulation through every state line the army. obliged, therefore, order arrest the spot, the feet stood wavering a tremendous precipice, prevent the officers being taken surprise, while the passions all inflamed, rescue plunging themselves into a gulf civil horror which there be no receding, issue the order the eleventh. this done upon the principle easier divert a wrong, point a right path, than recall the hasty fatal steps which have been already taken. commonly supposed, the officers had met agreeably the anonymous summons, their feelings all alive, resolutions have been formed, the consequences which may be more easily conceived than described. now will have leisure view the matter more calmly, will act more seriously. be hoped will be induced adopt more rational measures, wait a while longer a settlement their accounts, the postponing which appears be the most plausible, almost the only article which designing men can make an improper use, insinuating (which really do) done design peace may take place, prevent any adjustment accounts; which, say they, would inevitably be the case, the war cease to-morrow: or, supposing the best, would have dance attendance public offices, great distances, perhaps, equally great expenses, obtain a settlement, which would be highly injurious, nay, ruinous you. this their language. let beseech you, therefore, my good sir, urge this matter earnestly, without further delay. the situation these gentlemen, do verily believe, distressing beyond description. affirmed me, a large part have no better prospect before than a jail, turned loose without liquidation accounts, an assurance justice which so worthily entitled. prevail the delegates those states, through whose means these difficulties occur, may, my opinion, propriety be suggested them, any disastrous consequences should follow, reason their delinquency, must be answerable god their country the ineffable horrors which may be occasioned thereby. am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. p. s. have received your letter the fifth, have put matter train which mentioned it. g. w. am this instant informed, a second address the officers, distinguished no. 2, thrown into circulation. the contents evidently prove, the author in, near, camp; the following words, erased the second page this letter, ought not have met this treatment, viz.--âby others, the illegitimate offspring a person the army.â [19] the words, âby others, the illegitimate offspring a person the army,â which came here, obliterated the original, restored washington the _postscript_. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 17, 1783. sir: am duly honored your excellencyâs letters the fourth twelfth instant. much be regretted, though not be wondered at, steps so inflammatory a tendency have been taken the army. your excellency has, my opinion, acted wisely. the best way is, ever, not attempt stem a torrent, divert it. am happy find coincide opinion the conduct proper be observed yourself. am persuaded, more more, which most consistent your own reputation the public safety. our affairs wear a most serious aspect, well foreign domestic. before this gets hand, your excellency will probably have seen the provisional articles between great britain these states. might, first appearance, be concluded, these will be the prelude a general peace; there strong reasons doubt the truth such a conclusion. obstacles may arise different quarters; the demands spain holland; the hope, france, greater acquisitions the east; and, perhaps, still more probably, the insincerity duplicity lord shelburne, whose politics, founded the peculiarity his situation, well the character the man, may well be suspected insidiousness. am really apprehensive, peace not take place, the negotiations will tend sow distrust among the allies, weaken the force the common league. have, fear, men among us, men trust, who have a hankering after british connection. have others whose confidence france savors credulity. the intrigues the former, the incautiousness the latter, may be both, though different degrees, injurious the american interests, make difficult prudent men steer a proper course. there delicate circumstances, respect the late foreign transactions, which am not liberty reveal; which, joined our internal weaknesses, disorders, follies, prejudices, make this country stand upon precarious ground. some use, perhaps, may be made these ideas, induce moderation the army. an opinion their country not stand upon a secure footing, will operate upon the patriotism the officers against hazarding any domestic commotions. make these observations, cannot forbear adding, no excesses take place, shall not be sorry ill-humors have appeared. shall not regret importunity, temperate, the army. there good intentions the majority congress, there not sufficient wisdom decision. there dangerous prejudices, the particular states, opposed those measures which alone can give stability prosperity the union. there a fatal opposition continental views. necessity alone can work a reform. produce necessity, apply it, keep within salutary bounds? fear have been contending a shadow. the affair accounts considered having been put a satisfactory footing. the particular states have been required settle till the first august, â80; the superintendent finance been directed take measures settling since period. shall immediately see him the subject. have had eight states a half favor a commutation the half pay an average ten yearsâ purchase; is, five yearsâ full pay instead half pay life, which, a calculation annuities, nearly an equivalent. hope this will now shortly take place. have made considerable progress a plan be recommended the several states funding all the public debts, including those the army; which certainly the only way restore public credit, enable continue the war borrowing abroad, should be necessary, continue it. omitted mentioning your excellency, that, european intelligence, there great reason believe, all events, peace war, new-york will be evacuated the spring. will be a pity any domestic disturbances should change the plans the british court. have the honor be, the greatest respect, your excellencyâs most obât servât, a. hamilton. p. s. your excellency mentions, been surmised, the plan agitation formed philadelphia; combinations have been talked between the public creditors the army; members congress had encouraged the idea. this partly true. have myself urged, congress, the propriety uniting the influence the public creditors, the army, a part them, prevail upon the states enter into their views. have expressed the same sentiments out doors. several other members congress have done the same. the meaning, however, all this, simply, congress should adopt such a plan would embrace the relief all the public creditors, including the army; order the personal influence some, the connections others, a sense justice the army, well the apprehension ill consequences, form a mass influence, each state, favor the measures congress. this view, mentioned your excellency a former letter, thought the discontents the army be turned a good account. am still opinion, their earnest respectful applications redress will have a good effect. any combination _force_, would only be productive the horrors a civil war, end the ruin the country, would certainly end the ruin the army. a. h. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 24, 1783. sir: your excellency will, before this reaches you, have received a letter the marquis de la fayette, informing you, the preliminaries peace between all the belligerent powers have been concluded. congratulate your excellency this happy conclusion your labors. now only remains make solid establishments within, perpetuate our union, prevent our being a ball the hands european powers, banded against each other their pleasure; fine, make our independence truly a blessing. this, be lamented, will be an arduous work; for, borrow a figure mechanics, the centrifugal much stronger than the centripetal force these states; the seeds disunion much more numerous than those union. will add, your excellencyâs exertions essential accomplish this end, have been establish independence. will, upon a future occasion, open myself upon this subject. your conduct the affair the officers highly pleasing here. the measures the army such could have wished them, will add new lustre their character, well strengthen the hands congress. am, great truth respect, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 25, 1783. sir: wrote your excellency a day two ago express. since that, a committee, appointed the communications you, have had a meeting, find themselves embarrassed. have requested communicate our embarrassments confidence, ask your private opinion. the army, their resolutions, express an expectation congress will not disband previous a settlement accounts, the establishment funds. congress may resolve upon the first, the general opinion is, cannot constitutionally declare the second. have no right, the confederation, _demand_ funds; can only recommend: determine, the army shall be continued service till the states grant them, would be determine, the whole present army shall be a standing army during peace, unless the states comply the requisition funds. this, supposed, would excite the alarms jealousies the states, increase, rather than lessen, the opposition the funding scheme. also observed, the longer the army kept together, the more the payment past dues procrastinated; the abilities the states being exhausted their immediate support, a new debt every day incurred. further suggested, there danger keeping the army together, a state inactivity, a separation the several lines would facilitate the settlement accounts, diminish present expense, avoid the danger union. added, the officers each line, being the spot, might, their own solicitations, those their friends, forward the adoption funds the different states. a proposition will be transmitted colonel bland, the form a resolution, be adopted congress, framed upon the principles the foregoing reasoning. another proposition contained the following resolution: âthat the commander-in-chief be informed, the intention congress effect the settlement the accounts the respective lines previous their reduction; congress doing, will continue do, every thing their power towards procuring satisfactory securities what shall be found due such settlement.â the scope this your excellency will perceive without comment. am request will favor your sentiments both the propositions; and, general, your ideas what had best be done reference the expectation expressed the officers; taking into view the situation congress. one side, the army expect they will not be disbanded till accounts settled funds established. the other hand, they have no constitutional power doing any thing more than recommend funds, persuaded these will meet mountains prejudice some the states. a considerable progress been made a plan funding the public debts; be hoped will ere long go forth the states, every argument can give success. have the honor be, sincere respect, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. philadelphia, march 25, 1783. sir: the inclosed write more a public than a private capacity. here write a citizen, zealous the true happiness this country; a soldier who feels what due an army which suffered every thing, done much the safety america. sincerely wish _ingratitude_ not so natural the human heart is. sincerely wish there no seeds those who direct the councils the united states. while urge the army moderation, advise your excellency take the direction their discontents, endeavor confine within the bounds duty, cannot, an honest man, conceal you, am afraid their distrusts have too much foundation. republican jealousy a principle hostility an army, whatever be their merits, whatever be their claims the gratitude the community. acknowledges their services unwillingness, rewards reluctance. see this temper, though smothered great care, involuntarily breaking out upon too many occasions. often feel a mortification, which would be impolitic express, sets my passions variance my reason. too many, perceive, they could do safety color, would be glad elude the just pretensions the army. hope this not the prevailing disposition. supposing the country ungrateful, what can the army do? must submit its hard fate. seek redress its arms would end its ruin. the army would moulder its own weight, want the means keeping together: the soldiery would abandon their officers: there would be no chance success, without having recourse means would reverse our revolution. make these observations, not imagine your excellency can want motives continue your influence the path moderation; merely show cannot, myself, enter into the views coercion which some gentlemen entertain. confess, could force avail, should almost wish see employed. have an indifferent opinion the honesty this country, ill forebodings its future system. your excellency will perceive have written sensations chagrin, will make allowance coloring: the general picture too true. god send all more wisdom. am, very sincere respect, your excellencyâs obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. washington hamilton. newburgh, march 31, 1783. dear sir: have duly received your favors the seventeenth twenty-fourth ultimo. rejoice, most exceedingly, there an end our warfare; such a field opening our view, will, wisdom direct the cultivation it, make a great, a respectable, happy people: must be improved other means than state politics unreasonable jealousies prejudices; (it requires not the second sight see that) shall be instruments the hands our enemies, those european powers who may be jealous our greatness union, dissolve the confederation. attain this, although the way seems extremely plain, not so easy. my wish see the union these states established upon liberal permanent principles, inclination contribute my mite pointing out the defects the present constitution, equally great. all my private letters have teemed these sentiments; whenever this topic been the subject conversation, have endeavored diffuse enforce them; far any further essay, me, be productive the wished end, appear arrogate more than belongs me, depends so much upon popular opinion, the temper disposition people, not easy decide. shall be obliged you, however, the thoughts which have promised this subject, soon can make convenient. no man the united states, is, can be, more deeply impressed the necessity a reform our present confederation, than myself; no man, perhaps, felt the bad effects more sensibly: for, the defects thereof; want powers congress, may justly be ascribed the prolongation the war, and, consequently, the expenses occasioned it. more than half the perplexities have experienced the course my command, almost the whole the difficulties distress the army, have their origin here: still, the prejudices some, the designs others, the mere machinery the majority, make address management necessary, give weight opinions which combat the doctrines these different classes men, the field politics. would have been more full this subject, the bearer (in the clothing department) waiting. wish may understand what have written. am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. washington hamilton. newburgh, april 4, 1783. dear sir: the same post which gave your two letters the twenty-fifth march, handed one colonel bland the same point. observing both have been written the desire a committee which both members, have made a very full reply their subject my letter which addressed colonel bland; and, supposing unnecessary enter into a complete detail both, must beg leave refer colonel blandâs (a sight which have desired him give you), a full explanation my ideas sentiments. read your private letter the twenty-fifth pain, contemplated the picture had drawn astonishment horror: will yet hope the best. the idea redress, force, is too chimerical have had a place the imagination any serious mind this army; there is no telling what unhappy disturbances may result distress, distrust justice: the fears jealousies the army alive, hope no resolution will be come to, disbanding separating the lines, till the accounts liquidated. may rely upon it, sir, unhappy consequences would follow the attempt. the suspicions the officers afloat, notwithstanding the resolutions which have passed both sides. any act, therefore, which can be construed into an attempt separate before the accounts settled, will convey the most unfavorable ideas the rectitude congress: whether well ill founded, matters not; the consequences will be the same. will now, strict confidence, mention a matter which may be useful be informed of. is, some men (and leading ones, too) this army, beginning entertain suspicions congress, some members it, regardless the past sufferings present distress, maugre the justice which is due them, the returns which a grateful people should make men who certainly have contributed, more than any other class, the establishment independency, be made use mere puppets establish continental funds; that, rather than not succeed this measure, weaken their ground, they would make a sacrifice the army all its interests. have two reasons mentioning this matter you: the one is, the army (considering the irritable state is in, its sufferings, composition) is a dangerous instrument play with; the other, every possible means, consistent their own views (which certainly moderate), should be essayed get disbanded without delay. add a third: is, the financier is suspected be the bottom this scheme. sentiments this sort should become general, their operation will be opposed this plan, the same time would increase the present discontents. upon the whole, disband the army soon possible, consult the wishes it, which really moderate the mode, perfectly compatible the honor, dignity, justice, which is due the country it. am, great esteem regard, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. hamilton washington. april 11, 1783. sir: have received your excellencyâs letters the thirty-first march, fourth april; the last to-day. the one colonel bland, member the committee, been read committee confidentially, gave great satisfaction. the idea not attempting separate the army before the settlement accounts, corresponds my proposition. endeavoring let have some pay, had also appeared indispensable. the expectations the army, represented your excellency, moderation itself. to-morrow confer the superintendent finance the subject money. there will be difficulty, not, hope, insurmountable. thank your excellency the hints so obliging give your private letter. do not wonder the suspicions have been infused; nor should be surprised hear, have been pointed out one the persons concerned playing the game described. facts must speak themselves. the gentlemen who here the army, general mcdougal, who is still here, will be able give a true account those who have supported the just claims the army, those who have endeavored elude them. there two classes men, sir, congress, very different views: one attached state, the other continental politics. the last have been strenuous advocates funding the public debt upon solid securities; the former have given every opposition their power; have only been dragged into the measures which now near being adopted, the clamors the army other public creditors. the advocates continental funds, have blended the interests the army other creditors, a conviction, no funds, partial purposes, will go through those states whose citizens the united states largely indebted; they should be carried through, impressions the moment, would have the necessary stability: the influence those unprovided for, would always militate against a provision others, exclusion them. is vain tell men, who have parted a large part their property the public faith, the services the army entitled a preference: they would reason their interest their feelings: these would tell them, they had great a title any other class the community public justice; while this denied them, would be unreasonable make bear their part a burthen the benefit others. this is the way they would reason; their influence some the states was considerable, they would have been able prevent any partial provision. the question was not merely do justice the creditors, restore public credit. taxation, this country, was found, would not supply a sixth part the public necessities. the loans europe far short the balance, the prospect every day diminishing; the court france telling us, plain terms, she could not even do much she had done; individuals holland, every else, refusing part their money, the precarious tenure the mere faith this country, without any pledge the payment either principal interest. this situation what was be done? was essential our cause, vigorous efforts should be made restore public credit; was necessary combine all the motives this end, could operate upon different descriptions persons the different states: the necessities discontents the army presented themselves a powerful engine. but, sir, these gentlemen would be puzzled support their insinuations a single fact. was, indeed, proposed appropriate the intended impost trade the army debt; and, what was extraordinary, gentlemen who had expressed their dislike the principle the fund. acknowledge was one opposed this, the reasons already assigned, these additional ones: _that_ was the fund which most counted; obtain further loans europe, was necessary should have a fund sufficient pay the interest what had been borrowed, what was be borrowed. the truth was, these people, this instance, wanted play off the army against the funding system. mr. morris, will give your excellency a true explanation his conduct. he had been some time pressing congress endeavor obtain funds, had found a great backwardness the business. he found the taxes unproductive the different states; he found the loans, europe, making a very slow progress; he found himself pressed all hands supplies; he found himself, short, reduced this alternative, either making engagements which he could not fulfil, declaring his resignation case funds not established a given time. had he followed the first course, the bubble must soon have burst; he must have sacrificed his credit his character: public credit, already a ruinous condition, would have lost its last support. he wisely judged better resign: this might increase the embarrassments the moment; the necessity the case, was be hoped, would produce the proper measures; he might then resume the direction the machine advantage success. he also had some hope his resignation would prove a stimulus congress. he was, however, ill advised the publication his letters resignation. this was an imprudent step, given a handle his personal enemies, who, playing upon the passions others, have drawn some well-meaning men into the cry against him. mr. morris certainly deserves a great deal his country. believe no man this country, himself, could have kept the money machine agoing during the period he been office. every thing appears, his administration been upright well able. the truth is, the old leaven deane lee, is, this day, working against mr. morris. he happened, dispute, have been the side deane; certain men can never forgive him. a man whom once esteemed, whom will rather suppose _duped_ than wicked, is the second actor this business. the matter, respect the army, which occasioned most altercation congress, most dissatisfaction the army, been the half pay. the opinions this head have been two: one party was referring the several lines their states, make such commutation they should think proper; the other, making the commutation congress, funding continental security. was this last opinion; so all those who will be represented having made use the army puppets. our principal reasons were, _firstly_: referring the lines their respective states, those which opposed the half pay, would have taken advantage the officersâ necessities, make the commutation far short an equivalent. _secondly_: the inequality which would have arisen the different states the officers came compare (as happened other cases), would have been a new source discontent. _thirdly_: such a reference was a continuance the old wretched state system, which the ties between congress the army have been nearly dissolved; which the resources the states have been diverted the common treasury, wasted; a system which your excellency often justly reprobated. have gone these details, give a just idea the parties congress. assure you, upon my honor, sir, have given a candid state facts, the best my judgment. the men against whom the suspicions mention must be directed, are, general, the most sensible, the most liberal, the most independent, the most respectable characters our body, well the most unequivocal friends the army. a word, they the men who think continentally. have the honor be, sincere respect esteem, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. p. s. am chairman a committee peace arrangements. shall ask your excellencyâs opinion large, a proper military peace establishment. will just hint your excellency, our prejudices will make wish keep up few troops possible. this moment learn, an officer is arrived sir guy carleton dispatches; probably official accounts peace. a. h. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. philadelphia, april 15, 1783. sir: there two resolutions passed relative the restoration the british prisoners, making arrangements the surrender the posts the possession the british troops; the first which is be transacted conjunction the secretary war; the latter yourself alone. will explain some doubts which have arisen congress, regard the true construction the provisional treaty; which may be use transacting the business above-mentioned. the sixth article declares, there shall be no future confiscations, etc., after the _ratification the treaty america_; the seventh article makes the surrender prisoners, evacuation posts, cessation hostilities, etc., depend event, wit, _the ratification the treaty america_. now the doubt is, whether _the treaty_ means the provisional treaty _already concluded_, the _definitive_ treaty _to be concluded_. the last construction is most agreeable the letter the provisional articles; the former, most agreeable the usual practice nations: hostilities commonly cease the ratification the preliminary treaty. there is a great diversity opinion congress. will be, my opinion, advisable, the same time do not communicate our doubts the british, extract their sense the matter them. this may be done asking them, what periods they willing stipulate the surrender posts; the same time they asked, what manner will be the most convenient receive the prisoners. they postpone the evacuation the different posts the definitive treaty, shall then be justified doing the same respect prisoners. the question will then arise, whether, principles humanity, economy, liberality, ought not restore the prisoners, all events, without delay? much may be said both sides. doubt the expedience a total restoration prisoners, till they willing fix the epochs which they will take leave us. will add considerably their strength; accidents, though improbable, may happen. confess, however, am not clear my opinion. have the honor be, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. p.s. the provisional preliminary treaty, is ratified us--for the greater caution. a. h. his excellency general washington. washington hamilton. newborgh, april 16, 1783. dear sir: my last letter was written a hurry, was fatigued the more public, yet confidential, letter, which (with several others) accompanied it. possibly, did not, occasion, express myself (in what intended a hint) so much perspicuity ought: possibly, too, what then dropped, might have conveyed more than intended; do not, this time, recollect the force my expression. my meaning, however, was only inform, there different sentiments the army, well congress, respecting continental state funds: some wishing be thrown upon their respective states, rather than the continent large, payment; that, an idea should prevail, generally, congress, part its members, ministers, bent upon the latter, should _delay_ doing justice, _hazard_ pursuit their favorite object; might create such divisions the army, would weaken, rather than strengthen, the hands those who disposed support continental measures; might _tend_ defeat the end they themselves had view endeavoring involve the army. these reasons said, meant say, the army was a dangerous engine work with, might be made cut both ways; and, considering the sufferings it, would, more than probably, throw its weight into scale which seemed most likely preponderate towards its immediate relief, without looking forward (under the pressure present wants) future consequences the eyes politicians. this light, also, meant apply my observations mr. morris, whom, rather mr. g---- m----, is ascribed, a great degree, the groundwork the superstructure which was intended be raised the army the anonymous addresses. no man can be more opposed state funds local prejudices than myself, the whole tenor my conduct been one continual evidence of. no man, perhaps, had better opportunities _see_, _feel_, the pernicious tendency the latter than have; endeavor (i hope not altogether ineffectually) inculcate them upon the officers the army, upon all proper occasions: their feelings be attended soothed; they assured, continental funds cannot be established, they will be recommended their respective states payment. justice must be done them. should do injustice reports, what believe be the opinion the army, not inform you, they consider a friend, zealous serve them, one who espoused their interests congress, upon every proper occasion. is be wished, observed my letter colonel bland, congress would send a committee the army plenipotentiary powers. the matters requested me, your letter the chairman a committee, many other things, might then be brought a close, more despatch, a happier manner, than is likely they will be an intercourse letters the distance one hundred fifty miles: which takes _our_ expresses, a week, _at least_, go come. this moment, being without any instructions congress, am under great embarrassment respect the soldiers the war; shall be obliged, more than probably, the necessity the case, exercise my own judgment without waiting orders, the discharge them. should adopt measures which events may approve, all will be well. otherwise, what authority did do so? far a _strong_ recommendation congress, observe _all_ the articles peace, well the may imply a suspicion good faith the people this country, pretend not judge: am much mistaken, something the kind will not be found wanting; already perceive a disposition carp at, elude, such parts the treaty affect their different interests; although do not find a man, who, pushed, will not acknowledge, that, upon the _whole_, is a more advantageous peace than could possibly have expected. am, dear sir, great esteem regard, your most obedient servant, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. washington hamilton. newburgh, april 22, 1783. dear sir: did not receive your letter the fifteenth, till after my return ringwood, had a meeting the secretary war, the purpose making arrangements the release our prisoners, agreeably the resolve congress the fifteenth instant. finding a diversity opinion respecting the treaty, the line conduct ought observe the prisoners, requested, precise terms, know general lincoln (before entered the business), whether exercise our own judgment respect the _time_, well the _mode_, releasing them; be confined the latter: being informed had no option the first, congress wishing be eased the expense soon possible, acted _solely_ ground. the same time, scruple not confess you, this measure was not dictated necessity, is, my opinion, an impolitic one; place ourselves the power the british, before the treaty is definitive. the manner which peace was first announced, the subsequent declarations it, have led the country army into a belief, was final. the ratification the preliminary articles, the third february, so far confirmed this, one consequence resulting it, is, the soldiers the war, conceive the term their services actually expired; believe is not the power congress, their officers, hold them much, any, longer; obliged, this moment, increase our guards, prevent rioting, the insults which the officers meet with, attempting hold them their duty. the proportion these men, amount seven-elevenths this army: these shall lose the moment the british army will receive, their prisoners, an augmentation five six thousand men. is not investigate the causes which induced this measure; nor the policy those letters (from authority) which gave the _ton_ the present sentiment; since they have been adopted, ought, my opinion, put a good face upon matters; and, a liberal conduct throughout, our part (freed appearances distrust) try cannot excite similar dispositions theirs. indeed, circumstanced things _now_ are, wish, most fervently, all the troops which not retained a peace establishment, be discharged immediately, such them, least, do not incline await the settlement their accounts. they continue here, their claims, can plainly perceive, will increase; our perplexities multiply. a petition is this moment handed me, the non-commissioned officers the connecticut line, soliciting half pay. is well drawn, am told, did not read it. sent back, without appearing understand the contents, because did not come through the channel their officers. this may be followed others: mention it, show the necessity, the absolute necessity, discharging the _warsmen_ soon possible. have taken much pains support mr. morrisâs administration the army; and, proportion its numbers, believe he had not more friends any where: he will neither adopt the mode which been suggested, point out any other, nor show cause why the first is either impracticable impolitic (i have heard he objects it), they will certainly attribute their disappointment a lukewarmness him, some design incompatible their interests. here, my dear colonel hamilton, let assure you, would not be more difficult still the raging billows a tempestuous gale, than convince the officers this army, the justice, policy, paying men, civil offices, full wages, _they_ cannot obtain a sixtieth part their dues. am not unapprised the arguments which made use of, upon this occasion, discriminate the cases: they really futile; may be summed up this: though both are contending the same rights, expect equal benefits, yet, both cannot submit the same inconveniences obtain them: otherwise, adopt the language simplicity plainness, a ration salt pork, without pease, the case often is, would support the one well the other; and, such a struggle ours, would, my opinion, be alike honorable both. my anxiety get home, increases the prospect it. is happen? have not heard congress have yet had under consideration, the lands, other gratuities, which, different periods the war, have been promised the army. do not these things evince the necessity a committeeâs repairing camp, order arrange adjust matters without spending time a tedious exchange letters? unless something this kind is adopted, business will be delayed, expenses accumulated; the army will break up disorder, go home enraged, complaining injustice, committing enormities the innocent inhabitants every direction. write unreservedly. if, therefore, contrary my apprehension, all these matters are a proper train, mr. morris devised means give the army three monthsâ pay, will, am persuaded, excuse my precipitancy solicitude, ascribing an earnest wish see the war happily honorably terminated; my anxious desire enjoying some repose; the necessity my paying a little attention my private concerns, which have suffered considerably eight yearsâ absence. mâhenry, expressing, a letter have lately received him, a wish be appointed official secretary the court versailles, london, have, this opportunity, written mr. livingston, mr. madison, speaking him warm terms; wish him success all my heart. am, dear sir, great esteem regard, your most obedient servant, g. washington. colonel hamilton. hamilton gov. clinton. philadelphia, may 14, 1783. sir: the president congress will course have transmitted your excellency, the plan lately adopted congress funding the public debt. this plan was framed accommodate the objections some the states; this spirit accommodation will only serve render less efficient, without making more palatable. the opposition the state rhode island, instance, is chiefly founded upon these two considerations: the merchants are opposed any revenue trade; the state, depending almost wholly commerce, wants have credit the amount the duties. persuaded the plan now proposed will have little more chance success than a better one; that, agreed all the states, will, a great measure, fail the execution, received my negative. my principal objections were, _firstly_: not designate the funds (except the impost) which the whole interest is arise; which (selecting the capital articles visible property) the collection would have been easy, the funds productive, necessarily increasing the increase the country. _secondly_: the duration the funds is not coextensive the debt, limited twenty-five years; though there is a moral certainty, that, period, the principal will not, the present provision, be fairly extinguished. _thirdly_: the nomination appointment the collectors the revenue are reside each state, instead of, least the nomination, being the united states; the consequence which will be, those states which have little interest the funds, having a small share the public debt due their own citizens, will take care appoint such persons are least likely collect the revenue. the evils resulting these defects, will be, many instances the objects the revenues will be improperly chosen, will consist a multitude little articles, which will, experiment, prove insufficient; want a vigorous collection each state, the revenue will be unproductive many, will fall chiefly upon those states which are governed most liberal principles; want an adequate security, the evidences the public debt, will not be transferable any thing like their value; this not admitting an incorporation the creditors the nature banks, will deprive the public the benefit an increased circulation, course will disable the people paying the taxes want a sufficient medium. shall be happy be mistaken my apprehensions; the experiment must determine. hope our state will consent the plan proposed; because is her interest, all events, promote the payment the public debt continental funds (independent the general considerations union propriety). am much mistaken the debts due the united states the citizens the state new-york, do not considerably exceed its proportion the necessary funds: course has an immediate interest there should be a continental provision them. there are superior motives ought operate every state; the obligations national faith, honor, reputation. individuals have been already too long sacrificed public convenience. will be shocking, indeed an eternal reproach this country, begin the peaceable enjoyment our independence a violation all the principles honesty true policy. is worthy remark, least four-fifths the domestic debt, are due the citizens the states (from pennsylvania inclusively) northward. have the honor be, sir, your most obedient servant, a. hamilton. p. s. is particularly interesting the state should have a representation here. not only many matters are depending which require a full representation congress (and there is now a thin one), those matters are a nature so particularly interesting our state, ought not be without a voice them. wish two other gentlemen the delegation may appear soon possible; would be very injurious remain much longer here. having no future views public life, owe myself, without delay enter upon the care my private concerns earnest. a. h. his excellency governor clinton. hamilton governor clinton. philadelphia, june 1, 1783. sir: my last letter your excellency, took occasion mention, was great importance the state, this time, have a representation here, points which, its present situation, is particularly interested, are daily, will be daily, agitated. is also importance, this moment, the united states; (not only general considerations, but) because we have a very thin representation congress, are frequently unable transact any those matters which require nine states. wish your excellency would urge a couple gentlemen come on, becomes highly inconvenient remain here, have staid the full time be expected. observe, great regret, the intemperate proceedings among the people different parts the state, violation a treaty, the faithful observance which so deeply interests the united states. surely, the state new-york, its capital its frontier posts (on which its important fur trade depends) the hands the british troops, ought take care nothing is done furnish a pretext the other side, even delaying, much less refusing, the execution the treaty. we may imagine the situation great britain puts her under a necessity, all events, fulfilling her engagements, cultivating the good will this country. this is, no doubt, her true policy; we feel passion makes depart the dictates reason; we have seen passion has had so much influence the conduct the british councils, the whole course the war; we recollect, those who govern them, are men like ourselves, alike subject passions resentments; we reflect, also, all the great men england are not united the liberal scheme policy respect this country, the anarchy which prevails, there is no knowing whom the reins government may be committed; we recollect little a condition we are, enforce a compliance our claims; we ought, certainly, be cautious what manner we act, especially we, particular, have so much stake; should not openly provoke a breach faith the other side, setting the example. an important distinction is not sufficiently attended to. the fifth article is recommendatory; the sixth positive. there is no option, the part the particular states, any future confiscations, prosecutions, injuries any kind, person, liberty, property, account any thing done the war. is matter discretion the states, whether they will comply the recommendations contained the fifth article; no part the sixth can be departed them, without a direct breach public faith, the confederation. the power making treaties is exclusively lodged congress. power includes whatever is essential the termination the war, the preservation the general safety. indemnity individuals similar cases, is a _usual_ stipulation treaties peace, which many precedents are be produced. should be said, the associations the people, without legal authority, do not amount a breach the public faith; the answer is, the government not repress them, prevent their having effect, is much a breach, a formal refusal comply its part. the eye a foreign nation, our engagements are broken, is no moment whether is the want good intention the government, want power restrain its subjects. suppose a violence committed an american vessel the vessel another nation, upon the high seas, after complaint made there is no redress given: is not this a hostility against the injured nation which will justify reprisals? am not misinformed, there are violations going form law. am told indictments continue be brought under the former confiscation laws: a palpable infraction, true, the sixth article the treaty; which an immediate stop ought, no doubt, be put. has been said some men, the operation this treaty is suspended till the definitive treaty: a plain subterfuge. whatever is clearly expressed the provisional preliminary treaty, is binding the moment is made, the definitive treaty; which, fact, only developes, explains fixes, more precisely, what may have been too generally expressed the former. suppose the british should now send away, not only the negroes, all other property, all the public records their possession belonging us, the pretence above stated: should we not justly accuse them breaking faith? is this not already done the case the negroes who have been carried away, though founded upon a very different principle, a doubtful construction the treaty, not a denial its immediate operation? fine, is our interest advance this doctrine, countenance the position, nothing is binding till the definitive treaty, there are examples _years_ intervening between the preliminary definitive treaties? sir guy carleton, his correspondence, has appeared consider the treaty immediately obligatory: has been the policy which have pursued, promote the same idea. am not, indeed, apprehensive a renewal the war, peace is necessary great britain. think also most probable, her disposition conciliate this country will outweigh the resentments which a breach our engagements is calculated inspire. a treaty which has exceeded the hopes the most sanguine; which, the articles boundary the fisheries, is even better than we asked; circumstanced, too, this country is, respect the means making war; think the height imprudence run any risk. great britain, without recommencing hostilities, may evade parts the treaty. she may keep possession the frontier posts; she may obstruct the free enjoyment the fisheries; she may be indisposed such extensive concessions, matters commerce, is our interest aim at. all this she would find no opposition any foreign power: we are not a condition oblige her any thing. we imagine france, obviously embarrassed herself, her finances, would renew the war oblige great britain the restoration frontier posts; a compliance the stipulations respecting the fisheries (especially after a manifest breach the treaty our part); we speculate much random. observations might be made the last article, which would prove, is not the policy france support our interest there. are we prepared, the mere gratification our resentments, put those great national objects the hazard; leave our western frontier a state insecurity; relinquish the fur trade; abridge our pretensions the fisheries? do we think national character so light a thing, be willing sacrifice the public faith individual animosity? let the case be fairly stated: great britain america, two independent nations, war. the former possession considerable posts districts territory, belonging the latter; also the means obstructing certain commercial advantages which is deeply interested. is not uncommon, treaties peace, the _uti possidetis_ take place. great britain, however, the present instance, stipulates restore all our posts territories her possession. she even adds an extent, not within our original claims, more than a compensation a small part ceded another quarter. she agrees re-admit a participation the fisheries. what equivalent do we give this? congress are recommend the restoration property those who have adhered her; expressly engage, no future injury shall be done them, person, liberty, property. this is the sole condition, our part, there is not an immediate reciprocity (the recovery debts, liberation prisoners, being mutual; the former, indeed, only declaring what the rights private faith, which all civilized nations hold sacred, would have declared without it), stands the single equivalent all the restitutions concessions be made great britain. will be honest violate this condition, will be prudent put competition all the important matters be performed the other side? will foreign nations be willing undertake any thing us, us, they find the nature our governments will allow no dependence be placed upon our engagements? have omitted saying any thing the impolicy inducing, our severity, a great number useful citizens, whose situations do not make them a proper object resentment, abandon the country, form settlements will hereafter become our rivals, animated a hatred us, which will descend their posterity. nothing, however, can be more unwise than contribute, we are doing, people the shores wilderness nova scotia; a colony which, its position, will become a competitor us, among other things, branch commerce which our navigation navy will essentially depend: mean the fisheries; which, have no doubt, the state new-york will, hereafter, have a considerable share. your excellency freely deliver my sentiments, because am persuaded cannot be a stranger the force these considerations. fear not even hazard them the justice good sense those whom have the honor represent. esteem my duty do it, because the question is important the interests the state, its relation the united states. those who consult only their passions, might choose construe what say, too favorable a set men who have been the enemies the public liberty: those whose esteem am most concerned, will acquit any personal considerations; will perceive only urge the cause national honor, safety, advantage. we have assumed an independent station: we ought feel, act, a manner consistent the dignity station. anxiously wish see every prudent measure taken prevent those combinations which will certainly disgrace us, they do not involve other calamities. whatever distinctions are judged necessary be made, the cases those persons who have been opposition the common cause, let them be made legal authority, a fair construction the treaty, consistent national faith national honor. your excellency will have been informed, congress have instructed general washington garrison the frontier posts, surrendered, the three yearsâ continental troops. this is more the interest the state, than have them garrisoned its particular expense: should wish permanent provision might be made the same principle. wait see whether any continental peace establishment garrisons, etc., will take place, before engage the consent congress a separate provision. cannot forbear adding a word the subject money. the only reliance we now have redeeming a large anticipation the public credit, already made, making, the benefit the army, is the taxes coming in. the collection, hitherto, is out all proportion the demand. is vast consequence, this juncture, every thing possible should be done forward it. forbear entering into details which would be very striking upon this subject. will only say, unless there is a serious exertion the states, public credit must ere long receive another shock very disagreeable its consequences. have the honor be, perfect respect, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency governor clinton. hamilton reed. 1783. sir: having always entertained an esteem personally, could not, without reluctance, yield impressions might weaken sentiment: is pain find myself drawn, circumstances, animadvert upon the late message the executive council the assembly pennsylvania relative the mutiny, a manner which may seem impeach the candor those who the authors it. will be impossible persons who have read the report the committee, the message the council, however inclined make allowances the force involuntary bias, not conclude, one side the other, the facts have been wilfully discolored. decline any attempt set the public opinion right upon this subject; because, after all can be said, the judgments men will eventually be determined personal party prepossessions. so far am concerned, persuade myself those who are acquainted me, will place entire confidence my fairness veracity. doubt not your excellencyâs friends will be equally partial you, those the council them. though should despair rectifying fixing the public opinion, an appeal the public; though have seen too much the ridicule thrown upon such appeals, men official stations, the ill effect they have had upon the national character, not be willing sacrifice the desire justifying myself considerations prudence propriety; yet cannot forbear indulging my feelings so far enter into a few explanations your excellency; submitting the justness them the testimony your own mind. this is a mere private discussion, address myself your excellency particular; the rather, as, the style manner the message, take granted had the principal agency it: shall consider, the same grounds, the notes [20] paper the [20], a comment the report the committee yourself; aid the message. take up the matter individually, because mean treat a private footing; because, though do not acknowledge any peculiar responsibility, happened be my lot, chairman, principally conduct the conferences the part the committee. regard the whole this business a most unfortunate one; which, probably, none the actors will acquire great credit. deplore it, tending interrupt the harmony between congress a respectable, a meritorious member the union. who right, who wrong, is a question less importance, than mutual irritations may be best healed. whatever revives, continues, the former, is be regretted. lament be under an inducement discuss circumstances relate the remotest degree. nothing an attack upon the ingenuousness my conduct, could have called it. its prudence, either collectively individually, would patiently have been consigned the lash censure criticism, merited unmerited. happily, the present case, the members the committee have a strong ground, which they cannot easily be forced. apprehensive misconception, will not say misrepresentation, they tried render impossible written documents. the presumption, impartial minds, cannot fail be favor side which gave so decisive a proof its disposition fairness, endeavor put out its own power misrepresent. the professed scruples the council, cannot be admitted have any weight. usage, the plainest rules propriety, will dictate, never could have wounded the dignity, delicacy, the executive any state, have given a committee congress, appointed confer a subject moment, a written answer a request writing after previous explanations. the fact stated speaks itself. the consequences show, the precaution the committee was well judged; would have been well the council have concurred. the present case might be observed, there was, the first instance, a written application congress the council, the customary form resolutions: though a committee was authorized confer explain, a formal authentic answer might reasonably have been expected congress; and, desired the committee, should have been understood desired their behalf. there is an awkwardness reasoning upon self-evident positions; the council have, their conduct the first instance, their message since, put forward a doubt upon the subject, made a point importance, shall be excused examining a little further. what could the objection the council be founded? they say had been unusual. admitting the fact, was the mere novelty the thing a sufficient reason against it? there was no apparent inconvenience making a new precedent; if; the contrary, there was a manifest convenience it; ought not such a punctilio have given way considerations utility? was derogatory the dignity the council? surely, they communicate writing the executive servants congress, even those subordinate stations, is the practice every day, is indispensable the prosecution public business, they might, less expense dignity, pursue the same mode a part body itself. the distinction taken the council, their message the assembly, respecting the responsibility such executive officers, not applicable a committee, amounts any thing, proves only this: such officers ought, prudence, take greater precautions their own justification than a committee congress need do. is not be inferred, a committee congress, acting ministerially, think expedient use circumspection, those whom they are transacting business, can, propriety, refuse join them mode which is best adapted precision certainty. but, indeed, the ground distinction is erroneous. a committee congress act a ministerial capacity, are therefore responsible the body which they belong, well the servants body, though a different manner. be said they do not act ministerially, stand the place congress; then the council, upon their own principles, ought have complied their request. diminish the exceptionableness their refusal, is true, stated the council, though they said they could not _condescend_ do what the committee had asked; yet they declared themselves willing _grant_ an answer writing, congress should request it; they proposed, the committee should put their verbal answer writing, be afterwards perused examined them. the answer the committee, doubt not your excellency will recollect, was, the first point, congress all probability would not make the request, having determined (as the council had been already informed) not resume their deliberations the city, till effectual measures had been taken suppress the mutiny; should they assemble, would naturally feel a delicacy requesting what had been denied their committee. the second point, the council having judged inexpedient give a written answer, the committee would content themselves making the most accurate report their power, relying upon the confidence the body which they belonged, upon the candor the council. your excellency is too good a judge human nature, well the force language, not have perceived the time, the effect which the refusal the council had upon my mind. own struck me, either an uncandid reserve, an unbecoming stateliness; and, either supposition, a disrespect the body which the committee members. though nothing enters less into my temper than an inclination fetter business punctilio, after the council had discovered such overweening nicety, should have thought it a degradation my official character, have consented their proposal. the desire self-justification is so natural, should not have been surprised have seen the transactions which are the subject the councilâs message, receive a coloring favorable their purpose: did not expect find material facts either suppressed denied. the report made the committee the first interview the council, was, acknowledge, memory, therefore admit a possibility error; but, so far my memory can be relied on, the representation was just. am certain there is a mistake the insinuation, the circumstance the message sent congress the board sergeants, was not mentioned all the council; have a note it, taken immediately after the first conference subsequent the mutiny. the affair, the event , having assumed a more serious aspect, kept a regular minute the proceedings; a summary which, made up our report congress, which shall annex, large, this letter your excellencyâs perusal. the message entirely omits the declaration the council, ... ... ... [21]; the note says, the council only declared, âthat they could not be sure, such another insult would produce those exertions.â[22] the difference this article is great importance. the declaration made so deep an impression the time, almost the precise words remained my memory. they twice repeated, well we saw your excellency alone, your own house, the morning, delivered us, the council chamber, the determination the council. mr. ellsworth[23], half an hour afterwards, repeated them several members congress assembled the presidentâs house; a few hours time committed them writing. cannot suppose your excellencyâs recollection fails this particular; must pointedly appeal your candor. show the inaccuracy which the report the committee was composed, it is observed, the notes respect part which relates the commission given the mutineers the officers whom they had chosen represent them, only two hours had intervened between event the conference the council; it was very improbable the knowledge it could have so early reached the committee. it is added, none the council remembers have heard a single syllable respecting it, during the whole conference. the argument drawn the short interval between the delivery the commission the conference, it will be sufficient say, the committee held a constant communication general st. clair, he kept a vigilant eye upon all the motions the mutineers; his access them was easy; the fact question was a matter immediate notoriety; two hours abundant time a thing nature be conveyed the barracks general st. clairâs quarters; one the committee had actually seen, obtained the intelligence him, a little time before the interview the council commenced. it is much more extraordinary the council should have been apprised it so late, than the committee should have known it so early. the memory the council, it is unfortunate it should have been so fallible it is said have been: would rather suppose, âin the quick succession circumstances,â the matter had escaped recollection, than my minutes, well my memory, should have deceived me. well recollect, also, your excellency, it was mentioned, acknowledged it rather contradicted the pacific appearance which the conduct the troops, other respects, wore. these are the essential differences, point fact, between the report the committee, the message council: the whole complexion, indeed, one, materially varies the other; the most common observer must have noticed, different an aspect the same facts will bear, differently dressed arranged. it was avoid this, we proposed reduce them writing: this has not been done, spectators must judge, the situation the parties, the course the transactions, which side has given the justest relation. cannot, however, forbear remarking, see expressions civility, the part the committee, making a figure the message, very different their genuine intention; being introduced a manner gives them the air concessions favor the conduct the council. your excellency will certainly recollect, the committee very remote a concurrence sentiment the council; though they did not presume judge the disposition the citizens, strongly urged the expedience necessity calling out the militia, facility employing them success against an unofficered disorderly body mutinous soldiers. it is true, also, they acknowledged the candor which the council exposed them, what they deemed the temper their citizens, their own difficulties embarrassments; which were, no doubt, delineated great energy language, display circumstances: they certainly never admitted the candor refusing an answer writing, which was a part the _business_ transacted the council; nor did they _withdraw_, without giving an intelligible intimation their sense this proceeding. was also surprised see any part the private confidential conversation had your excellency, ushered into the message the council; moulded into such a shape, imply, an obvious construction, an approbation their reasons. your excellency will admit the following state this transaction be a just one. waited upon the council correct a piece information had given them respecting ammunition: even this is misstated, will be seen my minutes. having done this, my official business ended; was taken aside your excellency, a conversation passed declared confidence. informed me, a meeting the militia officers was then holding, consultation the council about eventual measures (in consequence, conjectured, a communication you, the preceding evening, the delegates the state, the intention congress remove the city, case they did not receive satisfactory assurances support). added, hoped nothing would be precipitated; proper allowances would be made the situation the council. understood your observations reference the departure congress, replied this effect: viewed the departure congress a delicate measure, including consequences important the national character abroad, critical respect the state pennsylvania, and, particular, the city philadelphia; the triumph a handful mutinous soldiers, permitted a place which is considered the capital america, surround, and, fact, imprison congress, without the least effort, the part the citizens, uphold their dignity authority, so oblige them remove the place which had been their residence during the revolution, would, it was be feared, be viewed a distance, a general disaffection the citizens the federal government; might discredit its negotiations, affect the national interests: that, home, it might give a deep wound the reputation pennsylvania; might draw upon it the resentments the other states, sow discord between congress the state; the removal congress would probably bring the affair a crisis; and, convincing the mutineers extremities intended, would either intimidate them into a submission, determine them immediate excesses; that, impressed these considerations, still hoping, notwithstanding some appearances the contrary, the mutineers might be sincere their professions submission, the council, further examination, would find it their power act vigor, had declined giving my assent a report writing, which would necessarily be followed the departure congress; though the committee had no discretion, the powers under which they acted, bound the tenor their instructions, the moment they did not receive âsatisfactory assurances prompt adequate exertions, the part the state, supporting the public authority,â advise the adjournment congress trenton princeton; therefore considered the delay this advice their extreme peril; yet, myself, should persist it, till the result the present consultation the militia officers, till some new circumstance should turn up, explain the designs the mutineers; pursuing this line conduct, should counteract the sense some gentlemen, whose feelings upon the occasion keen, the opinions others, who thought the situation congress, under the existing circumstances, extremely awkward, precarious, unjustifiable their constituents. your excellency approved my intention; wished time; promised, any new resolution should be taken, give immediate notice it. the meeting the militia officers dissolved. heard nothing your excellency. general st. clair, about two the afternoon, informed the committee, the officers appointed the soldiers manage their business, had, the first instance, refused give him an account their transactions; the which was only extracted them a peremptory demand. he mentioned the instructions they had received the soldiers, which contained faint affected concessions, mixed new inadmissible claims. the whole affair wore the complexion collusion between the officers the committee the soldiery; a mere amusement their part, till they could gain fresh strength execute their project, whatever it might be, greater advantage. this behavior the officers gave the affair a new more serious aspect, overcame my opposition the report. mr. peters, hearing the relation general st. clair, declared, once, he thought the committee had then no alternative; least, what he said was understood this sense general st. clair, mr. ellsworth, myself. am not much mistaken, general st. clair also expressed his opinion congress unsafe the city. the ideas suggested your excellency, the conversation have mentioned, substantially expressed several members congress the motives my delay; particularly, recollect, mr. madison, these observations addition: though was fully convinced congress, under an immediate view circumstances, would, reality, be justified withdrawing a place such an outrage government had been impunity perpetrated, a body armed mutineers, still, several days, complete command the city, either the feebleness public councils, the indisposition the citizens, afforded no assurance protection support; yet, the opinions men would be governed events, the most probable event was, the removal congress, announcing decisive measures coercion the soldiery, would awe them into submission, there was great danger the reputation congress would suffer the easy termination the business; they would be accused levity, timidity, rashness. though not within the scope my original intention, will indulge a few additional reflections this subject. am sensible the council, some respects, stand upon advantageous ground this discussion. congress left the city, because they had no forces hand, no jurisdiction over the militia, no assurances effectual support those who had. the council, the executive the state, necessitated remain the spot. soon after congress removed, the mutineers deserted their leaders, surrendered discretion. the multitude will be very apt conclude, the affair was trifling consequence; it vanished under its own insignificance; congress took up the matter too high a tone authority; they discovered a prudish nicety irritability about their own dignity: council more temperate, more humane, possessed greater foresight. the bias favor an injured army; the propensity the human mind lean the speciousness professed humanity, rather than the necessary harshness authority; the vague imperfect notions what is due public authority, an infant popular government; the insinuating plausibility a well-constructed _message_; will all contribute conclusion. let suppose an impartial man sense, well acquainted facts, form an argument upon the subject. it appears me, he might naturally fall into this train combination. it is a well known fact, that, the necessities the war, the delinquencies the several states, congress not enabled comply their engagements the army, which, after a glorious successful struggle their country, much suffering, exemplary patience, signal desert, they compelled, the irresistible dictates an empty treasury a ruined credit, disband, after having given strong indications their discontent, resentment the public neglect. a large part the army suffer themselves be patiently dismissed; a particular corps four five hundred men, stationed the place congress reside, refuse accept their discharges certain specified conditions. they even go further, and, stimulated their injuries, encouraged misled designing persons, are emboldened send a threatening message congress, declaring them, unless they would do them justice immediately, they would find means redress themselves. measures are indirectly taken appease this disorder, give the discontented soldiers much satisfaction the situation things will permit. shortly after, accounts are received, another corps, miles distance, have also mutinied; a part them, the number about eighty men, are their march join those who had already discovered so refractory a disposition. a committee congress is immediately appointed confer the executive the state, the measures proper be pursued this exigency. committee, the first instance, suggest the council, the expedience calling out a body militia, intercept the detachment mutineers its march, represent the danger the progress the spirit mutiny, future outrages, should those their march be suffered, without molestation, join a more numerous corps the same temper themselves. the council urge a variety difficulties: the shortness the time collect the militia before the mutineers would arrive; the reluctance which the citizens would obey a call against men whom they consider meritorious, injured, the like. the committee, perceiving the unwillingness the council employ the militia, desist pressing, recur expedients. the day after, the mutineers march triumph into the city, unite themselves those who are already there; the following day, the whole body assemble arms, throw off all obedience their officers, and, open defiance government, march the place which is the usual seat congress the council the state, while both are actually sitting; surround it guards, send a message the council, demanding authority appoint, themselves, officers command them, absolute discretion take such measures those officers should think proper, redress their grievances; accompanied a threat, there was not a compliance twenty minutes, they would let an injured soldiery upon them, abide the consequence. the members congress who the time assembled, request general st. clair, who happened be present, take such measures he should judge expedient, without committing the honor government, divert the storm, induce the troops return their quarters without perpetrating acts violence. general st. clair, concert the council, grants the mutineers permission elect, out officers then, formerly, commission, such they should confide in, represent their grievances the council, a promise, the council would confer the persons elected purpose. having obtained this promise, the mutineers return their quarters, military parade, continue open defiance government. the concession made was a happy compromise between an attention dignity, a prudent regard safety. men who had dared carry their insolence such an extreme, who saw no opposition their outrages, not be expected retreat without an appearance, least, gratifying their demands. the slightest accident was sufficient prompt men, such a temper situation, tragical excesses. however it might become the delicacy government not depart the promise it had given, it was its duty provide effectually against a repetition such outrages; put itself a situation give, instead receiving, the law; manifest its compliance was not the effect necessity, choice. this was not be considered the disorderly riot an unarmed mob, the deliberate mutiny an incensed soldiery, carried the utmost point outrage short assassination. the licentiousness an army is be dreaded every government; but, a republic, it is more particularly be restrained; directed against the civil authority, be checked energy, punished severity. the merits sufferings the troops might be a proper motive mitigating punishment, it was the power the government inflict it; it was no reason relaxing the measures necessary put itself situation. its authority was first be vindicated, then its clemency be displayed. the rights government are essential be defended, the rights individuals. the security the one is inseparable the other. and, indeed, every new government, especially the popular kind, the great danger is, public authority will not be sufficiently respected. upon this occasion, there more particular reasons decision. congress knew there were, within two three daysâ march the city, a more considerable body the same corps, part which had mutinied come town, had been the chief actors the late disorder; those men had, difficulty, been kept, the exertions their officers, joining the insurgents the first instance; there was another corps their neighborhood which, a little time before, had also discovered symptoms mutiny; a considerable part the same line which mutiny town, was every moment expected arrive the southward, and, there was the greatest reason conclude, would be infected the same spirit, their arrival, had presently happened the case a small detachment which had joined a few days before; there were, besides, large numbers disbanded soldiers, scattered through the country, want, who had not yet had time settle down any occupation, exchange their military private habits; some these really coming in, adding themselves the revolters; an extensive accession strength might be gained these different quarters; there all the sympathies like common wrongs, distresses, resentments, bring them together, unite them one cause. the partial success those who had already made an experiment, would be a strong encouragement others; the rather, the whole line had formerly mutinied, not only impunity, advantage themselves. this state things, decision was most compatible the safety the community, well the dignity government. though no general convulsion might be be apprehended, serious mischiefs might attend the progress the disorder. indeed, it would have been meanness, have negotiated temporized an armed banditti four five hundred men; who, any other situation than surrounding a defenceless senate, could only become formidable being feared. this was not an insurrection a whole people: it was not an army their officers their head, demanding the justice their country; either which might have made caution concession respectable: it was a handful mutinous soldiers, who had equally violated the laws discipline, the rights public authority. congress, therefore, wisely resolve, âit is necessary effectual measures be immediately taken supporting the public authority;â call upon the state which they reside, the assistance its militia, the same time they send orders the march a body regular forces an eventual resource. there was a propriety calling the aid the militia the first place, different reasons. civil government may always, more peculiar propriety, resort the aid the citizens, repel military insults encroachments. âtis there, it ought be supposed, it may seek its surest dependence, especially a democracy, which is the creature the people. the citizens each state are, an aggregate light, the citizens the united states, bound, much support the representatives the whole, their own immediate representatives. the insult was not congress personally; it was the government, public authority general; was very properly put upon footing. the regular forces, which congress could command, were a great distance, could not, a length time, be brought effectuate their purpose. the disorder continued exist the spot they were; was likely increase delay; might be productive sudden mischievous effects being neglected. the city the bank were immediate danger being rifled; and, perhaps, suffering other calamities. the citizens, therefore, were the proper persons make the first exertion. the objection, these were not the objects the care congress, can only serve mislead the vulgar. the peace safety the place which was the immediate residence congress, _endangered, too, the troops the united states_, demanded their interposition. the president the state pennsylvania was himself this opinion; having declared a member body, their troops were the offenders, it was proper them declare the necessity calling out the militia, a previous step its being done. nor is there more weight the supposition the danger was inconsiderable; that, the pacific appearances the troops, it was be expected, the disorder would subside itself. the facts were, the troops still continued a state mutiny; had made no submissions, nor offered any; they affected negotiate their arms their hands. a band mutinous soldiers, such a situation, uncontrolled, elated their own power, was not be trusted. the most sudden vicissitudes contradictory changes were be expected; a fit intoxication was sufficient, any moment, men who had already gone such length, make the city a scene plunder massacre. it was the height rashness leave the city exposed the bare possibility such mischiefs. the only question, this view, is, whether there was greater danger the city, attempting their reduction force, than endeavoring, palliatives, bring them a sense duty? it has been urged, appeared have operated strongly upon the minds the council,[24] the soldiers being already embodied, accustomed arms, ready act a momentâs warning, it would be extremely hazardous attempt collect the citizens subdue them, the mutineers might have taken advantage the first confusion incident the measure, do a great deal mischief, before this militia could have assembled equal superior force. it is not be denied, a small body disciplined troops, headed led their officers, a plan conduct, could have effected a great deal similar circumstances; it is equally certain, nothing can be more contemptible, than a body men, used be commanded obey, deprived the example direction their officers. they are infinitely less be dreaded than an equal number men who have never been broken command, nor exchanged their natural courage artificial kind which is the effect discipline habit. soldiers transfer their confidence themselves their officers, face danger the force example, the dread punishment, the sense necessity. take away these inducements leave them themselves, they are no longer resolute than till they are opposed. the present case, it was be relied upon, the appearance opposition would instantly bring the mutineers a sense their insignificance, submission. conscious their weakness, the smallness their numbers; a populous city, the midst a populous country; awed the consequences resisting government arms, confounded the want proper leaders proper direction; the common soldiers would have thought nothing making their peace the sacrifice those who had been the authors their misconduct. the idea, therefore, coercion, was the safest most prudent: more was be apprehended leaving them their own passions, than attempting control them force. it will be seen, by, far the events, justly appreciated, corresponded this reasoning. congress were not only right adopting measures coercion; they were also right resolving change their situation, proper exertions were not made the particular government citizens the place they resided. the want such exertions would evince some defect, no matter where, would prove they ought have no confidence their situation. they were, all intents purposes, the power a lawless, armed banditti, enraged, whether justly, not, against them. however they might have had a right expose their own persons insult outrage, they had no right expose the character representatives, the dignity the states they represented, the union. it was plain, they could not, propriety, such a state things, proceed their deliberations they were; it was right they should repair a place they could do it. it was far impossible, the mutineers might have been induced seize their persons, hostages their own security, well a hope extorting concessions. had such an event taken place, the whole country would have exclaimed, why did not congress withdraw a place they found they could not be assured support; the government was so feeble, the citizens so indisposed, suffer three four hundred mutinous soldiers violate, impunity, the authority the united states, their own state? they resolved depart, the want adequate exertions, they had reason doubt their being made, the disinclination shown the council call out the militia the first instance: they did actually depart, they were informed the council, the efforts the citizens were not be looked for, even a repetition the outrage which had already happened; it was be doubted what measure outrage would produce them. they had also convincing proof, the mutiny was more serious than it had even first appeared, the participation some the officers. throw the blame harshness precipitancy upon congress, it is said, their dignity was only _accidentally_ _undesignedly_ offended. much stress has been laid upon the message, the soldiery being directed the council, not them. all this, however, is very immaterial the real merits the question. whatever might have been the first intention the mutineers this particular act, whether it proceeded artifice confusion ideas, the indignity congress was the same. they knew congress customarily held their deliberations the state house: it even be admitted, they knew saturday be a day usual recess, which, perhaps, is not altogether probable: they came the place they saw, knew, congress be assembled there. they did not desist consequence this; proceeded station their guards, execute their purposes. members congress went out them; remonstrated them; represented the danger their proceedings themselves, desired them withdraw: they persisted till they obtained what they supposed a part their object. a majority the same persons had, some days before, sent a message, almost equally exceptionable, congress; the time they scarcely spoke any other body than congress; who, indeed, may naturally be supposed have been the main object their resentments: congress, having always appeared the soldiery, be the body who contracted them, who had broken faith them, it is not be supposed they were capable investigating the remote causes the failures, so transfer the odium congress the state. the substantial thing be considered this question, is the violation public authority. it cannot be disputed, the mutiny troops is a violation authority which they owe obedience. this was, the present case, aggravated a high degree atrociousness, the gross insult the government pennsylvania, the face congress, defiance their displeasure. it was further aggravated continuing condition a series time. the reasons have been assigned, made it incumbent upon congress interpose; they called upon the state pennsylvania, not only vindicate its own rights, support their authority, the declining a compliance was a breach the confederation, the duty which the state pennsylvania owed the united states. the best apology the government pennsylvania, this case, is, they could not command the services their citizens. so improper a disposition the citizens, admitted, must operate an additional justification congress, their removal. the subsequent events, justly appreciated, illustrate the propriety their conduct. the mutineers did not make voluntary submissions consequence negotiation, persuasion, conviction. they did not submit till after congress had left the city, publishing their intentions coercion; till after there had been an _actual call_ upon the militia; till their leaders instigators, alarmed the approach force, the fear being betrayed the men, fled. they were reduced coercion, not overcome mildness. it appears, too, while they were professing repentance, a return their duty, they were tampering the troops yorktown lancaster, increase their strength; two officers, least, were concerned the mutiny, who, their letters since, have confessed, some project importance was contemplation. the call the militia was made the day after it had been pronounced ineligible the council. there could have been little change, time, either the temper preparations the citizens. the truth is, the departure congress brought the matter a crisis; the council were compelled, necessity, do what they ought have done before, through choice. it is be lamented they did not, an earlier decision, prevent the necessity congress taking a step which may have many disagreeable consequences. they then would [_the residue the manuscript is not found._] [20] these blanks are the manuscript.

[23] âmr. ellsworth was the other member the committee.--t. p.â [24] your excellency will recollect, that, our private conversation, urged this consideration, appealed my military experience; made, substantially, the observations which follow. hamilton madison. princeton, june 29, 1783. dear sir: am informed, that, among other disagreeable things said about the removal congress philadelphia, it is insinuated, it was a contrivance some members, get them out the state pennsylvania, into one those which they belonged; am told, this insinuation has been pointed particular. though am persuaded, all disinterested persons will justify congress quitting a place they were told they were not expect support (for the conduct the council amounted that), yet, am unwilling be held up having had an extraordinary agency the measure interested purposes, the fact is directly the reverse. were a witness my conduct opinions through the whole the transaction, am induced trouble your testimony upon this occasion. do not mean make a public use it; but, through my friends, vindicate myself the imputations have mentioned. will therefore request your answers the following questions: did part the resolutions, which related the removal congress, originate me, not? did i, a member the committee, appear press the departure; did not rather manifest a strong disposition postpone event long possible, even against the general current opinion? wish be particular full your answer your memory will permit. think will recollect, my idea was clearly this: the mutiny ought not be terminated negotiation; congress were justifiable leaving a place they did not receive the support which they had a right expect; but, their removal was a measure a critical delicate nature; might have an ill appearance europe; might, events, be susceptible an unfavorable interpretation this country; it was prudent delay it till its necessity became apparent: not only till it was manifest there would be no change the spirit which seemed actuate the council; till it was evident, complete submission was not be expected the troops; that, give full time this, it would be proper delay the departure congress till the latest period which would be compatible the idea meeting trenton princeton thursday--perhaps even till thursday morning. am, sir, your most obedient servant, a. hamilton. james madison, junior, esq. hamilton james madison, jr. philadelphia, july 6, 1783. dear sir: my arrival this city am more convinced than was the necessity giving a just state facts the public. the current runs strongly against congress, a great measure want information. when facts are explained they make an impression, incline conclusions more favorable us. have no copy the reports my possession, which puts it out my power publish them. will procure send one without loss time? without appearing, intend give them the public some additional explanations. this done moderation will no doubt have a good effect. the prevailing idea is, the actors the removal congress were influenced the desire getting them out the city, the generality the remainder timidity--some say passion. few give a more favorable interpretation. will thank your letter answer the following question: what appeared be my ideas disposition respecting the removal congress? did appear wish hasten it, did not rather show a strong disposition procrastinate it? will be obliged answering this question do it fully. do not intend make any public use it, through my friends vindicate myself the insinuation have mentioned, confute the supposition the motive assigned did actuate the members whom it fell be more particularly active. yours, a. hamilton. hamilton mrs. hamilton. philadelphia, july 22, 1783. wrote you, my beloved eliza, the last post, which hope will not meet the fate many others my letters must have met with. count upon setting out see four days; have been so frequently disappointed unforeseen events, shall not be without apprehensions being detained, till have begun my journey. the members congress are very pressing not go away this time, the house is thin, the definitive treaty is momently expected. tell your father mr. rivington, a letter the south carolina delegates, has given information, coming him admiral arbuthnot, the mercury frigate is arrived new-york the definitive treaty, the city was be evacuated yesterday, the treaty. am strongly urged stay a few days the ratification the treaty; all events, however, will not be long absent. give joy the happy conclusion this important work which your country has been engaged. now, a very short time, hope we shall be happily settled new-york. my love your father. kiss my boy a thousand times. a. hamilton. hamilton governor clinton. princeton, july 27, 1783. sir: a few days since was honored your excellencyâs letter the was glad find your ideas the subject corresponded mine. shall, a day two, take leave congress, think it my duty give my opinion the legislature, a matter importance the state, which has been long depending, is still without a prospect termination the train which it has been placed: mean the affair the grants. it is hazardous pass a positive judgment what will happen a body so mutable congress; all have seen, have come a settled opinion, no determination will be taken executed them any other manner, than prescribed the confederation. there is always such a diversity views interests; so many compromises be made between different states; that, a question this nature, the embarrassments which have been increased the steps have preceded, which the passions the opposite sides have taken a warm part, decision must be the result necessity. while congress have a discretion, they will procrastinate: when they are bound the constitution, they must proceed. it is, therefore, my opinion, it will be advisable the legislature, when they meet, review the question; either relinquish their pretensions the country dispute, instruct their delegates, a decision is not had within a limited time, declare the submission congress revoked, institute a claim according the principles the confederation. it would be out my province discuss which side the alternative ought, policy, prevail: will take the liberty observe, the last should be preferred, it would be expedient remove every motive opposition private claims; not only confirming, their full latitude, previous the trial, the possessions the original settlers, even the grants the usurped government. it may happen, it will be eventually necessary employ force; and, this case, it would be great importance neither the inhabitants the grants, nor powerful individuals other states, should find their private interest contradiction the state. this has already had great influence counteracting our wishes; would continue throw impediments the way ulterior measures; might last kindle a serious flame between the states. communicated your excellency, a former letter, had declined pressing the application the legislature congress, respecting the state troops garrisoning the frontier posts, because temporary provision had been made another way, which would save the state the immediate expense; because there was a prospect some general provision the defence the frontiers a continental establishment, which was be preferred every account. a report this purpose is now before congress; the thinness representation has, some time, retarded, still retards, its consideration. the definitive treaty is not yet arrived; accounts which, though not official, appear deserve credit, it may be daily expected. a gentleman, known confided in, has arrived philadelphia, who informs, he saw a letter dr. franklin mr. barkeley, telling him the definitive treaties were signed the twenty-seventh may, between all the parties; new-york was be evacuated six months the ratification the preliminaries europe, which will be the twelfth fifteenth next month. it is not my intention return congress, take this opportunity make my respectful acknowledgments the legislature, the honorable mark their confidence conferred upon me, having chosen represent the state body. shall be happy my conduct has been agreeable them. perfect respect, have the honor be, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general

which influenced the determination congress this occasion. it will readily be perceived, should congress, this late day, accede the propositions made the state, it might be impracticable carry them

influenced congress against the declared sense the state; give directions the commander-in-chief garrisoning those posts continental troops. this is a duty which, not having been present the debates, we find ourselves incompetent. we can therefore, only refer his excellency the legislature you, our worthy colleagues, who, being fully possessed the facts, can alone give the necessary official information. sentiments the most perfect esteem regard, we have the honor be, gentlemen, your most obedient servants, jas. duane. ezra lâhommedieu. the honorable cols. william floyd alexander

because it added your happiness, because it tended fix your residence a state which long wished be remain a citizen. the character talents delegates congress daily become more more important, regret your declining appointment this interesting period. respect, however, is due the considerations which influence you, they do not oppose your accepting a place the legislature, hope the state will still continue draw advantage your services; much remains be done, laborers do not abound. am happy hear terms peace, the conduct your negotiators, give general satisfaction: there are some our countrymen, it seems, who are not content; that, too, an article which thought be very unexceptionable; viz., the one ascertaining our boundaries. perhaps those gentlemen are latitudinarians. the american newspapers, some months past, contain advices which do us harm. violences associations against the tories, pay an ill compliment government, impeach our good faith the opinion some, our magnanimity the opinion many. our reputation also suffers, the apparent reluctance taxes, the ease which we incur debts without providing their payment. the complaints the army; the jealousies respecting congress; the circumstances which induced their leaving philadelphia; the too little appearance a national spirit pervading, uniting, invigorating the confederacy, are considered omens which portend the diminution our respectability, power, felicity. hope that, the wheel turns round, other better indications will soon appear. am persuaded america possesses too much wisdom virtue, permit her brilliant prospects fade away want either. the tories are almost much pitied these countries they are execrated ours. an undue degree severity towards them, would, therefore, be impolitic, well unjustifiable. they who incline involve whole class men indiscriminate punishment ruin, certainly carry the matter too far. it would be an instance unnecessary rigor, unmanly revenge, without a parallel, except the annals religious rage times bigotry blindness. what it signify nine-tenths these people are buried? would rather see the sweat their brows fertilize our fields than those our neighbors. * * * * * victory peace should, my opinion, be followed clemency, moderation, benevolence: we should be careful not sully the glory the revolution, licentiousness cruelty. these are my

hamilton washington. albany, september 30, 1783. dear sir: flatter myself may indulge a consciousness my services have been some value the public, least enough merit the small compensation wish, will make no apology your excellency, conveying, through you, wish congress. are able inform them, they wish information, what degree may have been useful: have entire confidence will do justice. a letter which wrote several months ago, intimated it might be your power contribute the establishment our federal union upon a more solid basis. have never since explained myself. the time, was hopes congress might have been induced take a decisive ground; inform their constituents the imperfections the present system, the impossibility conducting the public affairs, honor themselves advantage the community, powers so disproportioned their responsibility; and, having done this, a full forcible manner, adjourn the moment the definitive treaty was ratified. retiring the same juncture, wished you, a solemn manner, declare the people, your intended retreat public concerns; your opinion the present government, the absolute necessity a change. before left congress despaired the first; your circular letter the states had anticipated the last. trust it will not be without effect; though am persuaded it would have had more, combined what have mentioned. all events, without compliment, sir, it will do honor the sensible well meaning; and, ultimately, it is be hoped, the people large, when the present epidemic frenzy has subsided. am, dear sir, sincere esteem, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. hamilton washington. albany, september 30, 1783. sir: think may address the subject this letter your excellency more propriety than any other person, it is purely a military nature; are best acquainted my services an officer; are now engaged assisting form the arrangements the future peace establishment. your excellency knows, march, â82, relinquished all claim any future compensation my services, either during the residue the war, after its conclusion--simply retaining my rank. this foundation build a hope, may be permitted preserve my rank, the peace establishment, without emoluments unattached any corps--as an honorary reward the time have devoted the public. may hereafter travel, may find it an agreeable circumstance appear the character have supported the revolution. rest my claim solely the sacrifice have made; because have no reason believe my services have appeared any value congress; they declined giving them any marks their notice, an occasion which appeared my friends entitle it, well the common practice sovereigns, the particular practice this country repeated instances. your excellency will recollect, it was my lot york town command, senior officer, a successful attack upon one the enemyâs redoubts; the officer who acted a similar capacity another attack, made the same time the french troops, has been handsomely distinguished, consequence it, the government which he belongs; there are several examples among us, congress have bestowed honors upon actions, perhaps not more useful nor, apparently, more hazardous. these observations are inapplicable the present congress, further than they may possibly furnish an additional motive a compliance my wish. the only thing ask your excellency, is, my application may come into view the course the consultations the peace establishment. have the honor be, sincere esteem, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. hamilton governor clinton. albany, october 3, 1783. sir: have lately received messrs. duane lâhommedieu, an extract a letter your excellency the delegates, the twenty-third august last, requesting âa particular detail the motives which influenced the determination congress,â respecting the application the legislature have their state troops released continental pay, the purpose garrisoning the frontier posts. my letters your excellency, the first june twenty-seventh july, which were intended be official, summarily informed you, congress had made temporary provision garrisoning the frontier posts, a plan was under deliberation relative a peace establishment, which would, course, embrace object permanently; such temporary provision being made the common expense, a general plan being under consideration the future, had declined pressing a compliance the application the legislature; conceiving it be more the interest the state, the expense should be jointly borne, than it should fall exclusively upon itself. did not enter into a more full detail upon the subject, because the business continued, the time left congress, an undecided state; it was impossible judge what views would finally prevail. the concurrent resolutions the two houses had been immediately, their receipt, referred a committee appointed report a peace establishment, who had suspended their report these resolutions, till it should appear, what would be the fate a general plan which had been submitted. the motives influenced congress making the provision they did make, rather than immediately assenting the application the state; far was able collect them, they were these: the opinions many were unsettled the most eligible mode providing the security the frontiers, consistent the constitution, well respect the general policy the union, considerations justice those states whose frontiers were more immediately exposed. a considerable part the house appeared think, reasons a very cogent nature, the well-being the union required a federal provision the security the different parts; it would be a great hardship individual states, peculiarly circumstanced, throw the whole burthen expense upon them, recurring separate provisions, a matter, the benefit which would be immediately shared their neighbors, and, ultimately, the union large: that, indeed, it was not probable particular states would be either able, or, _upon experiment_, willing, make competent provision their separate expense; the principle might eventually excite jealousies between the states unfriendly the common tranquillity. freely confess was one who held this opinion. questions naturally arose the true construction the articles confederation upon this head; questions delicate interesting, difficult solution. one hand, it was doubted whether congress were authorized the confederation, proceed upon the idea a federal provision: the other, it was perceived such a contrary construction would be dangerous the union, including, among other inconveniences, this consequence: the united states, congress, cannot raise a single regiment, nor equip a single ship, the general defence, till after a declaration war, an actual commencement hostilities. this dilemma, an important constitutional question; other urgent matters depending before congress; the advanced season requiring a determination upon the mode securing the western posts case a surrender this fall; all sides the house concurred making a temporary provision, the manner which has been communicated. my apprehension the views the legislature was simply this: that, looking forward a surrender the posts, conceiving, some expressions the articles confederation, separate provision was be made the frontier garrisons; they had thought it expedient apply the troops already foot purpose, propose congress give their sanction it. under this apprehension; reflecting, besides, those troops were engaged only a short period, upon a very improper establishment continue, account the enormous pay the private men; the expense which is now shared all, which would have fallen solely upon the state, had the application been complied with; would probably be the rate nearly eighty thousand dollars per annum, a considerable sum the state its present situation; acknowledge your excellency, saw pleasure, rather than regret, the turn which the affair took. shall be sorry, however, it has contravened the intentions the legislature. will take the liberty add, upon this occasion, it has always appeared great importance, this state particular, well the union general, federal, rather than state, provision should be made the defence every part the confederacy, peace well war. without entering into arguments general policy, it will be sufficient observe, this state is, all respects _critically situated_. its relative position, shape, intersections, viewed the map, strongly speak this language.--strengthen the confederation; give it exclusively the power the sword: let each state have no forces its militia. a question mere economy, the following considerations deserve great weight. the north river facilitates attacks sea land: and, besides the frontier forts, all military men are opinion, a strong post should be maintained west point, some other position the lower part the river. canada is well governed, it may become well peopled, inhabitants attached its government. the british nation, while it preserves the idea retaining possession country, may be expected keep foot there, a large force. the position force, either defence offence, will necessarily be such will afford a prompt easy access us. our precautions defence, must be proportioned their means annoying us: we may hereafter find it indispensable increase our frontier garrisons. the present charge a competent force quarter, thrown additionally, into the scale those contributions which we must make the payment the public debt, other objects general expense, if the union lasts, would, fear, enlarge our burthen beyond our ability: charge, hereafter increased, it may be, would be oppressively felt the people. it includes, not only the expense paying subsisting the necessary number troops, keeping the fortifications repair; probably creating others; furnishing the requisite supplies military stores. say nothing the indian nations, because, though it will be always prudent be upon our guard against them, yet, am opinion we diminish the necessity it making them our friends: take it granted, there cannot be a serious doubt, any where, the obvious policy endeavoring do it. their friendship, alone, can keep our frontiers peace. it is essential the improvement the fur trade; an object immense importance the state. the attempt the total expulsion so desultory a people, is chimerical it would be pernicious. war them is expensive it is destructive: it has not a single object; for, the acquisitions their lands is not be wished, till those now vacant are settled: the surest, well the most just humane way removing them, is extending our settlements their neighborhood. indeed, it is not impossible they may be already willing exchange their former possessions others more remote. the foregoing considerations would lose all force, if we had full security the rest the world would make our safety prosperity the first object their reverence care: an expectation this kind would be too much against the ordinary course human affairs; too visionary be a rule national conduct. it is true, our situation secures us conquest, if internal dissensions do not open the way: when nations now make war upon each other, the object seldom is total conquest. partial acquisitions; the jealousy power; the rivalship dominion, commerce; sometimes national emulation antipathy; are the motives. nothing shelters us the operation either these causes. the fisheries; the fur trade; the navigation the lakes the mississippi; the western territory; the islands the west indies, reference traffic; short, the passions human nature, are abundant sources contention hostility. will not trespass further your excellencyâs patience. expected, indeed, my last letter would have finished my official communications; messrs. duane lâhommedieu having transmitted the extract your letter mr. floyd myself, order we might comply what your excellency thought would be expected the legislature, it became my duty give this explanation. mr. floyd having been congress a little time after the concurrent resolutions arrived, being now a great distance me, occasions a separate communication. have the honor be, perfect respect, your excellencyâs most obedient servant, a. hamilton. n. b. did not the time inclose the resolution, directing the general provide garrisoning the frontier posts, because understood it would course be transmitted the president, the secretary war. a. h. his excellency governor clinton. madison hamilton. princeton, october 16, 1783. dear sir: your favor the sixth july, some singular ill luck, never found its way my hands till yesterday evening. the only part now needs attention, is a request would answer the following question: âwhat appeared be my ideas disposition respecting the removal congress: did appear wish hasten it, did not rather show a strong disposition procrastinate it?â if this request had been received the time it ought, it might have been answered fully then wished. even after the delay which has taken place, my recollection enables me, certainty, witness, the uniform strain your sentiments, they appeared, both particular conversations myself, incidental ones others my presence, was opposed the removal congress, except the last necessity; when finally yielded the measure, it appeared be more compliance the peremptory expostulations others than any disposition your own mind; after the arrival congress princeton, your conversation showed reviewed the removal, rather regret than pleasure. perhaps this obedience your wishes may be too late answer the original object them. could not omit such an opportunity testifying the esteem regard which am your obedient servant, j. madison, jr. the hon. alexander hamilton, esq. washington hamilton. rocky hill, october 18, 1783. dear sir: am favored your two letters the thirtieth september. the debate indian affairs, which, believe, is got through, the residence congress, which is yet agitation, have entirely thrown aside, some time, the consideration the peace establishment. when it is resumed, will take care your application comes into view; shall be happy if any thing my power may contribute its success; being, great truth, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. colonel hamilton. mchenry hamilton. princeton, october 22, 1783. dear hamilton: the homilies you delivered congress are still recollected pleasure. the impressions they made are favor your integrity; no one believes you a man honor republican principles. were you ten years older twenty thousand pounds richer, there is no doubt you might obtain the suffrages congress the highest office their gift. you are supposed possess various knowledge, useful, substantial, ornamental. your very grave your cautious, your men who measure others the standard their own creeping politics, think you sometimes intemperate, seldom visionary: were you pursue your object much cold perseverance you do ardor argument, you would become irresistible. a word, if you could submit spend a whole life dissecting a fly, you would be, their opinion, one the greatest men the world. bold designs; measures calculated their rapid execution; a wisdom would convince its own weight; a project would surprise the people into greater happiness, without giving them an opportunity view it reject it; are not adapted a council composed discordant elements, a people who have thirteen heads, each which pay superstitious adorations inferior divinities. have been deterred, day day, sending you the extract you desire, a proclamation the subject, which expected would have passed. it is still _in dubio_. have reported fleuryâs case, the principle you recommend. fear his half-pay will not be granted. congress, some time ago, determined fix their federal town the delaware, near trenton. yesterday they determined erect a second federal town the potomac, near georgetown; reside equal periods (not exceeding one year) annapolis trenton, till the buildings are completed. we adjourn the twelfth next month, meet annapolis the twenty-sixth. adieu, my dear friend; the days your happiness drop a line yours. james mchenry. p.s. our exemplification the treaty has passed, will be transmitted the state officially. j. mch. the hon. alexander hamilton, esq. washington hamilton. rocky hill, november 6, 1783. dear sir: the inclosed is a letter which had written, was about dispatch the date it; but, upon second thoughts, determined postpone it, try, if, the importance the matter, could not bring forward the peace establishment previously. have tried vain. congress, after resolving, the ---- last month, adjourn upon the twelfth this, did, equally unexpectedly surprisingly me, finish their session this place the day before yesterday; without bringing the peace establishment, any the many other pressing matters, a decision. finding this was likely be the case, showed your letter some your particular friends; consulted them the propriety making known your wishes my testimonial your services congress; they advised decline it, under a full persuasion no discrimination would, indeed, could, be made this late hour, every other officer, the highest the lowest grades (not actual command), were retiring without the retention rank; that the remainder, upon a peace establishment (if a continental one should ever take place), would come upon the new system, under fresh appointments; so that unless you wished come into actual command again (which none supposed), they saw no way which you could preserve your rank. have the pleasure inclose you a brevet, giving you the rank full colonel. am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. colonel hamilton. hamilton president congress. new-york, december 8, 1783. sir: being concerned counsel a number persons who have been, since the annunciation the provisional treaty, indicted under the confiscation laws this state, the part they are supposed have taken the late war, we are induced, the desire our clients, their behalf, apply congress, through your excellency, an exemplification the definitive treaty. we take it granted, that ere this it will have been direction the united states. we have found a great strictness the courts this state. it will, we apprehend, be necessary be able produce an exemplification the treaty under the seal the united states. a matter so interesting a great number individuals, it not belong us urge considerations national honor, we hope we shall be excused when we observe, that there appears be no probability that the legislature this state will interpose its authority put a stop prosecutions, till the definitive treaty is announced form. the mean time, a period is limited the appearance the indicted persons plead their indictments, if they neglect appear, judgment default will be entered against them. it is therefore great consequence them, that we should have our possession, speedily possible, an authentic document the treaty, its ratification congress; we, this account, pray an exemplification both. we persuade ourselves that the justice liberality congress will induce a ready compliance our prayer, which will conduce the security a great number individuals who derive their hopes safety the national faith. we have the honor be perfect respect, your excellencyâs most obedient humble servants, a. hamilton others. his excellency the president congress. hamilton j. b. church. new-york, march 10, 1784. my dear sir: my last you informed you that a project a land bank had been set foot mr. sayre, the ostensible parent; that had reason suspect the chancellor was the true father. the fact has turned out supposed, the chancellor, a number others, have since petitioned the legislature an exclusive charter the proposed bank. thought it necessary, not only a view your project, the sake the commercial interests the state, start an opposition this scheme; took occasion point out its absurdity inconvenience some the most intelligent merchants, who presently saw the matter a proper light, began take measures defeat the plan. the chancellor had taken so much pains the country members, that they all began be persuaded that the land bank was the true philosopherâs stone that was turn all their rocks trees into gold; there was great reason apprehend a majority the legislature would have adopted his views. it became necessary convince the projectors themselves the impracticability their scheme; counteract the impressions they had made a direct application the legislature. some the merchants, effect these purposes, set foot a subscription a money bank, called upon subscribe. was a little embarrassed act, upon the whole concluded it best fall them, endeavor induce them put the business upon such a footing might enable you, advantage, combine your interests theirs; since the thing had been taken up upon the broad footing the whole body the merchants, it appeared that it never would be your interest pursue a distinct project opposition theirs; that you would prefer, so far you might choose employ money this way, become purchasers the general bank. the object, this supposition, was have the bank founded such principles would give you a proper weight the direction. unluckily, this purpose, entered rather late into the measure: proposals had been agreed upon, which, among other things, it was settled that no stockholder, whatever amount, should have more than seven votes, which was the number which a holder ten shares was be entitled. an after meeting some the most influential characters, engaged them so far depart this ground, allow a vote every five shares above ten. the stockholders have since thought proper appoint one the directors. shall hold it till wadsworth you come out, and, if you choose become parties this bank, shall make a vacancy one you. inclose you the constitution, the names the president, directors, cashier. an application a charter has been made the legislature, a petition against granting an exclusive one the land bank. the measures which have been taken appear have had their effect upon the minds the partisans the land bank. the affairs the bank pennsylvania appear be some confusion. they have stopped discounts; have no apprehension that there is any thing more the matter than temporary embarrassment having a little overshot their mark their issues paper, the opposition which the attempt establish a new bank had produced. affectionately, a. hamilton. j. b. church, esq. hamilton fitzsimmons. new-york, march 21, 1784. dear sir: permit introduce your acquaintance attention mr. seton, cashier the bank new-york. he is just setting out philadelphia procure materials information the forms business. recommend him you, because am persuaded you will pleasure facilitate his object. personally, dare say you will be pleased him. he will tell you our embarrassments prospects. hope an incorporation the two banks, which is evidently the interest both, has put an end differences philadelphia. here a wild impracticable scheme a land bank stands our way; the projectors it persevering spite the experience they have, that all the mercantile moneyed influence is against it. a. hamilton. william seton hamilton. philadelphia, 27 march, 1784. dear sir: you will observe my letter this day our president, that have been requested postpone my visit the bank until they shall be well informed that the bank new-york has, actually will, obtain a charter. although am confident this is only an ostensible reason not wishing see the bank, it will be highly necessary should be regularly informed what is doing this respect, that i may be able speak fully firmness the subject; therefore, exclusive any letter the director may write me, i trust you will communicate whatever may appear you essential me know. the fact is (and which cannot be communicated the many, therefore not mentioned my official letter), their motive not wishing see me the bank just now, arises their being present very great confusion--the opposition the new bank began it, being pressed so hard this opposition, they were obliged lay themselves so open, that it evidently appeared, if carried further, it would strike too fatal a blow. therefore, the safety the community large, it became absolutely necessary drop the idea a new bank, join hand hand relieve the old bank the shock it had received. gold silver had been extracted such amounts that discounting was stopped, this fortnight past not any business has been done the bank this way. the distress it has occasioned those dependent circulation engaged large speculations, is severe; and, if their cup misery must overflow, the last arrival europe, intelligence is received that no less a sum than Â£60,000 sterling mr. morrisâs bills, drawn the dutch loan, are under protest. it is well known that the bank, some means other, must provide this sum. the child must not desert its parent distress, and, such is their connection, that whatever is fatal the one must be so the other. however, the man who has more than once, his consummate abilities, saved the american empire ruin, will no doubt be found equal overcome these temporary inconveniences, restore universal confidence good order. i trust you will be guarded your conversation others this subject, lest it might recoil me, not only place me a disagreeable situation, defeat the purposes my coming there. i have had several interviews our friend gov. morris; he is making the bank new-york a branch the bank north america, we differ widely our ideas the benefit that would result such a connection. if it will not be intruding too much upon your time goodness, may i request that you will now then inform me what is doing our legislature, permit me assure you, that it will ever give me singular pleasure have it my power evince the respect esteem which i am, dear sir, your obât very humble servât, wm. seton. alexander hamilton, esq. hamilton gouverneur morris. new-york, april 4, 1784. pardon me, my dear sir, not sooner having obeyed your orders respect the inclosed. i part it reluctantly; wit is so rare an article, that when we get so much it so small a compass, we cannot easily consent be dispossessed it. i am very happy hear the union your two banks; you will believe me when i tell you, that, more deliberate consideration, i was led view the competition a different light that which it first struck me. i had no doubt that it was against the interests the proprietors; but, a superficial view, i perceived benefits the community, which, a more close inspection, i found were not real. you will call our proceedings here _strange doings_. if some folks were paid counteract the prosperity the state, they could not take more effectual measures than they do. it is vain attempt kick against the pricks. discrimination bills; partial taxes; schemes engross public property the hands those who have present power; banish the real wealth the state, substitute paper bubbles; are the only dishes that suit the public palate this time. permit me ask your opinion a point importance the new-york bank--the best mode receiving paying out gold. i am aware the evils that which has been practised upon philadelphia--_weighing quantities_; i cannot satisfy myself about a substitute, unless there could be a coinage. favor me your sentiments this subject soon you can. believe me, equal warmth sincerity, yours, a. hamilton. gouverneur morris, esq. hamilton de chastellux. new-york, june 14, 1784. monsieur le chevalier: colonel clarkeson, who will have the honor delivering you this, being already known you, i give him this letter more the sake renewing you the assurances my attachment esteem, than a supposition that he will stand need any new title your attention. i will therefore only say him, that his excellent qualities cannot be known without interesting those whom they are known, that a personal warm regard him, i should be happy, if any thing i could say, could be an additional motive your countenance civilities him. i speak him the light a friend. the messenger science, he cannot fail acquire the patronage one her favorite ministers. he combines the views private satisfaction, which a voyage europe cannot afford, an undertaking

this is rather a late period acknowledge yours the seventh april. i have lived the constant intention answer it, i now execute my purpose. why not sooner? âprocrastination is the thief time,â says dr. young. i meant have written fully the subject the gold. i waited some informations annapolis the probability a mint. i afterwards intended a long letter upon a subject i mentioned mr. seton, namely, a coalition between your bank the national bank. i do not find either party inclined it. yet both would be the better it. you, i believe, will soon be out blast unless it should take place. i could say a great deal this subject, it would be very useless. when you find your cash diminish very fast, remind seton my predictions, let him tell you what they were. if the legislature should attempt force paper money down your throats, it would be a good thing be somewhat independent them. i must check myself, i shall go too far into a business which would plague us both no purpose. it shall be left, therefore, until we meet. very affectionately yours, gouv. morris. alexander hamilton, esq. la fayette hamilton. albany, oct. 8, 1784. dear hamilton: * * * * * several delays have retarded the opening the treaty; when i was upon the ground, it has been found that my influence the indians, both friendly hostile tribes, was much greater than the commissioners, even myself, had conceived; so that i was requested, even every one the tribes there, speak those nations. there were some, more less, each tribe. i stayed long the commissioners thought i could do them some good; that has rather cramped my private plans visits. now, my dear friend, i am going hartford, boston, newport; thence, water, virginia, order save time; about the twentieth next month i hope be again you new-york: before that time will write you newport. adieu, my dear hamilton. most affectionately i am yours, la fayette. p.s. i am told mr. jay is not determined upon accepting. i much wish he may consent it; the more so, his probable successor not hit my fancy. indeed, i very much wish mr. jay may accept the office. colonel hamilton. la fayette hamilton. boston, oct. 22, 1784. my dear hamilton: every step i move, there comes upon me a happy necessity change my plans. the reception i met boston no words can describe; least it is impossible express what i have felt. gratitude well propriety conspired all other inducements keep me here some time longer. rhode island new hampshire i must visit, intend embarking the first second day next month virginia, the nymph frigate, which has been sent my account. less than four weeksâ time this day, i hope be congress; when my business there is concluded, will come new-york, i hope we will spend some days together. my stay your city has been too short, far inadequate the feelings my gratitude, the marks goodness bestowed upon me; this time i will be some days longer my new-york friends. upon reflecting my situation, my circumstances, my love america, yet the motives that might render it improper her employ me a public capacity, i have confined myself a plan which, the same time that it gratifies my attachment serves the united states, cannot have any shadow inconvenience. after having told me they know my zeal, i wish congress add, they want me continue those friendly, and, i might say, patriotic exertions; that consequence it, their ministers home, their ministers abroad, will have a standing order look me one whose information exertions will ever be employed the service the united states; when they think it is wanted, communicate me upon the affairs america; that congress will, whenever i think it proper, be glad my correspondence. upon that general scale, every minister may conceal me what he pleases, may write me only when he pleases; should he ever think my assistance is wanting, he has a title ask, i have one give it; my connection america is ever kept, without giving jealousy, upon such a footing will remain the disposition each public servant congress. it seems me, my dear friend, this idea already met your approbation. case it does, do promote it your delegates others. if it does not, write it me the bearer whom i send land apologize the general my delays. our friend knox has been most affectionate kind me. yours ever, la fayette. p.s. i have written wadsworth, spoken bostonians respecting the baronâs affairs. i will do the same virginia, maryland, elsewhere. alexander hamilton, esq. la fayette hamilton. paris, april 13, 1785. my dear hamilton: although i have just now written mchenry, requesting him impart my gazette you, a very barren one indeed, i feel within myself a want tell you, i love you tenderly. your brother church has sailed america, since which i had a letter his lady, who is very good health. an old letter our friend greene, i have been delighted find he consents send his son be educated mine; the idea makes me very happy. i wish, dear hamilton, you would honor me the same mark your friendship confidence. there is no fear a war, i intend visiting the prussian austrian troops. one your new-york gazettes, i find an association against the slavery negroes, which seems me worded such a way give no offence the moderate men the southern states. i ever have been partial my brethren that color, i wish, if you are one the society, you would move, your own name, my being admitted the list. my best respects wait mrs. hamilton. adieu. your affectionate friend, la fayette. john adams hamilton. grosvenor-square, london, oct. 19, 1785. sir: the instance mr. hartley, behalf his friend, mr. francis upton, i advised mr. upton apply some counsellor new-york, particularly mr. hamilton, whose reputation was known me, although his person was not. mr. hartley now requests mr. upton a letter introduction. a total stranger, character, it would be very difficult find a pretence excuse the liberty i take presenting mr. upton you, recommending his case your attention. but, we say the bar, i wish i was, _valeat quantum valere potest._ much esteem, i have the honor be, sir, your most obedient most humble servant, john adams. mr. hamilton. hamilton wilkes. november, 8, 1785. sir: the message which you sent me yesterday, your letter to-day, were conceived terms which i am little accustomed. were i consult my feelings only upon the occasion, i should return an answer very different that which i have, justice my own conduct, resolved upon. whatever light we are view each other hereafter, however harsh indelicate i may think the method you have taken obtain an explanation be, i shall, my own part, leave no room suppose that i intentionally gave you any cause complain. i shall, therefore, explicitly declare, that whatever inattention may have appeared towards you, was solely owing the continual hurry which my engagements, a long time past, have kept me; that, so far its having been occasioned any designed neglect, it was what, under the circumstances, might have happened my best friend. indeed, much what you mention have been done you, i am a stranger to. the frequent callings, yourself your servant, did not, that i recollect, come my knowledge. it is possible some them might have been mentioned me, and, the hurry my mind, forgotten. once, i remember, i saw your servant just i was going out some urgent business. i sent a verbal message, promising that i would see you; which i intended do, soon i had made up my resolution the business the interview. when i received your note i was about sending you an answer writing; but, upon inquiring your servant, finding him gone, i omitted it, an intention see you personally. you say it is near six months since you first applied me the business question. a great part the time i gave you all the answer i could give you; wit, that i had written mr. macaulay, only waited his answer. about two months since, i received it. i have been the greater part the time out town indispensable business. the intervals i have been occupied about objects immediate absolute necessity, which could not have been delayed without letting my business run into utter confusion. mr. macaulayâs concerns have been hanging upon my spirits. i have been promising myself, day day, bring them a conclusion; more pressing objects have unavoidably postponed it. i thought the delay required some apology mr. macaulay, i never dreamt having given occasion offence you. i will not, however, deny, upon a review what has passed, that there have been, through hurry inadvertency my part, appearances neglect towards you; between gentlemen men business, unfavorable conclusions ought not be drawn before explanations are asked. allowances ought be made the situations parties; the omissions men, deeply involved business, ought rather be ascribed that cause than ill intentions. had you, the first instance, expressed me (in such a manner respect yourself delicacy me dictated) your sense these appearances, i should have taken pains satisfy you that nothing improper towards you was intended me. make one my clerks the instrument communication, the bearer me a harsh accusation, was ill-judged ungenteel. take it granted that you had received an injury me, without first giving me an opportunity an explanation, couch your sense it terms so offensive some those used your letter, is an additional instance precipitation rudeness. inadvertencies susceptible misapprehension, i may commit; i am incapable intending wound injure any man who has given me no cause it; i am incapable doing any thing, sir, which i need be ashamed. the intimation, your part, is unmerited unwarrantable. after thus having explained my own conduct you, given you my ideas yours, it will depend yourself far i shall be indifferent, not, your future sentiments my character. i shall only add, that to-morrow you shall receive me my determination the matter business between us. i am, due consideration, sir, your most obedient servant, a. hamilton. john wilkes, esq. wilkes hamilton. november 9, 1785. sir: the moment i received yours, i perceived the precipitancy my own conduct, was very sorry i had so far mistaken both our characters act the manner i have done. i flatter myself, that the same candor which has dictated yours, will be exerted towards mine, that you will only view it the act a man who conceived himself injured. you have never experienced the cruel reverses fortune, you can scarcely judge the least insinuations their prejudice will affect those persons who have; much more suspicious they are the behavior mankind towards them. the morning i left the message you, i had been called upon one the creditors mr. heart, who thought it very strange no dividend was made; he insinuated, some party must be interested the delay. it is the first money transaction i have engaged since my release. i felt the insinuation alluding me, a force, which, perhaps, i should not. however, that moment i went your office. the next morning, when i saw your note mr. atkinson, found myself totally set aside a business i had, most undoubtedly, been originally neglected, i felt myself very much agitated; that frame mind i wrote my last you. so much i thought it necessary add explanation. i am convinced, now, i have been too hasty; i am sorry it. it will put me my guard future, i make no doubt prove beneficial me, provided it has not been the means hurting me your estimation, which i am now more desirous than ever obtaining. i am, sir, respect, your much obliged, most obedient servant, john wilkes. colonel hamilton. hamilton washington. november 23, 1785. dear sir: major fairly is just setting out a visit you, i believe some business relating the cincinnati. the society this state met some short time since, took into consideration the proposed alterations the original frame the institution: some were strenuous adhering the old constitution, a few adopting the new, many a middle line. this disagreement opinion, the consideration that the different state societies pursuing different courses--some adopting the alterations entire; others rejecting them the same way; others adopting part rejecting part--might beget confusion defeat good purposes, induced a proposal, which was unanimously agreed to, that a committee should be appointed prepare lay before the society, a circular letter, expressive the sense the society the different alterations proposed, recommending the giving powers a general meeting the cincinnati, make such alterations might be thought advisable, obviate objections promote the interests the society. i believe there will be no difficulty agreeing change the present mode continuing the society; it appears be the wish our members, that some other mode may be defined substituted, that it might not be left the uncertainty legislative provision. we object, too, putting the funds under legislative direction. indeed, it appears us, the legislatures will not, present, be inclined give us any sanction. i am the committee: i cannot flatter myself, that when the object is better digested, more fully explained, it will meet your approbation. the poor _baron_ is still soliciting congress, has every prospect indigence before him. he has his imprudences; but, upon the whole, he has rendered valuable services; his merits the reputation the country, alike, demand that he should not be left suffer want. if there could be any mode which your influence could be employed his favor, writing your friends congress, otherwise, the baron his friends would be under great obligations you. i have the honor be, sincere esteem, your obât humble servât, alex. hamilton. his excellency general washington. washington hamilton. mount vernon, december 11, 1785. dear sir: i have been favored your letter the twenty-third november, major fairly. sincerely do i wish that the several state societies had, would adopt the alterations that were recommended the general meeting, may, seventeen hundred eighty-four. i then thought, have had no cause since change my opinion, that if the society the cincinnati mean live peace the rest their fellow-citizens, they must subscribe the alterations which were that time adopted. that the jealousies of, prejudices against, this society, were carried an unwarrantable length, i will readily grant; that _less_ than was done, _ought_ have removed the fears which had been imbibed, i am clear in, i am that it would not have done it. it is a matter little moment, whether the alarm which seized the public mind was the result foresight, envy, jealousy, a disordered imagination: the effect perseverance would have been the same. wherein, then, would have been found an equivalent the separation interests which (from my best information, not one state only, many) would inevitably have taken place? the fears the people are not yet removed; they only sleep; a very little matter will set them afloat again. had it not been the predicament we stood respect the foreign officers the charitable part the institution, i should, that occasion, far my voice would have gone, have endeavored convince the narrow-minded part our countrymen, that the _amor patriÃ¦_ was much stronger our breasts than theirs, that our conduct, through the whole the business, was actuated nobler more generous sentiments than were apprehended, abolishing the society once, a declaration the causes, the purity its intention. the latter may be interesting many, the former is an insuperable bar such a step. i am sincerely concerned find, your letter, that the baron is again straitened circumstances. i am much disinclined ask favors congress; if i knew what the object his wishes are, i should have much pleasure rendering him any service my power, such members that body i now then correspond with. i had flattered myself, what was told me some time ago, that congress had made a final settlement the baron much his satisfaction. i am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, g. washington. alex. hamilton, esq. hamilton nathaniel hazard. april 24, 1786. sir: your letter the twenty-first was only delivered me this morning. the good opinion liberal men i hold too high estimation not be flattered that part your letter which relates me personally. the other part i have communicated general schuyler, he assures me he will see all his friends this afternoon upon the subject; so that i have no doubt, far his influence extends, it will be employed favor the success the bill the assembly, it has already been the senate. taking this step, however, i would not be understood declare any opinion concerning the principles the bill, which i am not sufficiently acquainted form a decided opinion. i have merely made your letter the occasion introducing the subject general schuyler, whose sentiments are favorable your wishes you could desire. i make this observation that spirit candor which i hope will always direct my conduct. i am aware that i have been represented an enemy the wishes what you call your corps. if this has been meant that i do not feel much any man, not immediately interested, the distresses those merchants who have been a great measure the victims the revolution, the supposition does not do justice either my head my heart. if it means that i have always viewed the mode relieving them a matter peculiar delicacy difficulty, it is well founded. i should have thought it unnecessary enter into this explanation, were it not that i am held up a candidate the ensuing election; i would not wish that the step i have taken, respect your letter, should be considered implying more than it does; i would never wish conciliate the expense candor. the other hand, i confide your liberality not infer more than i intend the explanation i have given; hope you will believe me be, great cordiality esteem, dear sir, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. mr. hazard. cushing, dana, breck hamilton. new-york, sept. 10, 1786. gentlemen: understanding, our arrival this city last friday evening, that you had gone the convention annapolis the week past, we take the liberty acquaint you, beg you communicate the convention, if it should be opened before we arrive there, that we shall set off this place to-morrow join them, as commissioners the state massachusetts, which we hope do the course this week. the commissioners philadelphia were sail thence this city, the seventh instant, so that they may be expected soon after us. great respect, your most obedient humble servants, thomas cushing. f. t. h. dana. saml. breck. the gentlemen commissioners new-york. la fayette hamilton. paris, april 12, 1787. my dear hamilton: it is an age since i heard you. you i hear some our friends, the newspapers. although i have a right complain, i want let you know the proceedings our assembly, which, as it is unusual france, may raise your curiosity. our constitution is pretty much what it was england before it had been fairly written down minutely preserved; so that we have great claims freedom, a national representation, the denial taxes, &c., &c. disposition one hand, levity the other have manÅuvred us out almost every privilege. they will still subsist, however, more less, some provinces, particularly those bretagne. now that the follies courts had obliged government saddle us new taxes, the opposition our magistrates did present itself as an obstacle the ministers, they have thought proper call an assembly notables, chosen the king, taken among the first people _each_ order, begin granting them what is more wished the nation, an assembly each province. the last assembly notables, 1626, had been obedient the ministers. this one came at a more enlightened period. it happened under a minister, who, although he has parts, is not equal some the members--men fine abilities. we are backed the nation, although not her representatives, have behaved as her interpreters, we have formed a great majority favor popular measures. the speeches the throne, those m. de calonne, have been printed: the last one contains many falsehoods. the first measure we took was the clergy declare they were ready pay the same proportion other people, the noblesse make the same declaration, reject a pecuniary privilege that was offered, lieu the other that is taken off. we have gratefully accepted the provincial elective assemblies, have united such alterations as will invigorate them. m. de calonne had made a mixture democracy despotism which did annihilate those checks gradations that are necessary evils, wherever there is a king. i think the provincial assemblies, as they are proposed us, may lay a foundation a good building. several plans the removal internal custom offices, the free exportation corn, the change the salt tax, the annihilation some duties, now the disposal the kingâs domanial possessions, have been examined, underwent several alterations. some we have only left the titles the chapters, changed them, my opinion, much the better. the idea a general tax kind, was proposed the government, we said it was not practicable. as any new imposition, we have answered, it is impossible form an opinion before we know the return the exports the two last years, the plans economy that are intended. we have not, it is true, any powers the nation, our opinion is asked, a measure has become necessary, a majority us do not think their opinion can be given, until those preliminaries are fulfilled. there is a very interesting contrast between the kingâs power at versailles, the opposition that assembly which is held there, divided seven committees twenty, twenty-two each, presided a prince the blood. hitherto we have not voted a general assembly, although we had some hear the minister. the opinions the committees only are now taken, the end each vote will be pronounced the whole house, beginning the last up the first rank. you know that we have the clergy, magistracy, noblesse, tiers etat. at the last meeting we had before the recess these holidays, i had a personal battle some importance. the kingâs domanial property has been a pretence lavish money the princes the blood, favorites, the powerful people the country. i had the day before moved an examination those bargains, wherein more than fifty millions have been thrown away. the great people being afraid being found out, particularly m. de calonne, who is guilty the most indecent depredation, thought they must intimidate me the bishop langres, m. de la luzerneâs brother, who had seconded my motion. they, consequence it, persuaded the king have us told his brother, our president, that such motions ought be signed. upon which, we signed the inclosed paper; the bishop said, that after the rents, he would bring some accounts, signed him, the bargain sinecure, made m. de calonne. the king was very angry me; m. de calonne, who had his confidence, intended signal revenge. i was preparing support what i had said, when we suddenly heard that m. de calonne had been dismissed. the keeper the seal was also sent off. i am glad we got rid m. de calonne; his successor, who, unfortunately, is an old broken man, may improve the opportunity this assembly, let us make useful arrangements. adieu, my dear hamilton; my best respects wait mrs. hamilton. remember me gen. knox, wadsworth--all our friends, particularly the good doctor. most affectionately yours, la fayette. p. s. donât tell the french chargÃ© dâaffairs that you have this paper me, except that there is nothing it, topics have spread every _where_. hamilton washington. new-york, july 3, 1787. dear sir: my passage through the jerseys, since my arrival here, i have taken particular pains discover the public sentiment, i am more more convinced that this is the critical opportunity establishing the prosperity this country a solid foundation. i have conversed men information, not only this city, different parts the state; they agree that there has been an astonishing revolution the better the minds the people. the prevailing apprehension among thinking men is, that the convention, the fear shocking the popular opinion, will not go far enough. they seem be convinced, that a strong, well-mounted government will better suit the popular palate, than one a different complexion. men office are, indeed, taking all possible pains give an unfavorable impression the convention; the current seems be moving strongly the other way. a plain, sensible man, a conversation i had him yesterday, expressed himself nearly this manner:--the people begin be convinced that âtheir excellent form government,â as they have been used call it, will not answer their purpose, that they must substitute something not very remote that which they have lately quitted. these appearances, though they will not warrant a conclusion that the people are yet ripe such a plan as i advocate, yet serve prove that there is no reason despair their adopting one equally energetic, if the convention should think proper propose it. they serve prove that we ought not allow too much weight objections drawn the supposed repugnance the people an efficient constitution. i confess, i am more more inclined believe, that former habits thinking are regaining their influence more rapidity than is generally imagined. not having compared ideas you, sir, i cannot judge far our sentiments agree; but, as i persuade myself, the genuineness my representations will receive credit you. my anxiety the event the deliberations the convention, induces me make this communication what appears be the tendency the public mind. i own you, sir, that i am seriously deeply distressed at the aspect the counsels which prevailed when i left philadelphia. i fear that we shall let slip the golden opportunity rescuing the american empire disunion, anarchy, misery. no motley feeble measure can answer the end, will finally receive the public support. decision is true wisdom, will be not less reputable the convention, than salutary the community. i shall necessity remain here ten twelve days. if i have reason believe that my attendance at philadelphia will not be mere waste time, i shall, after that period, rejoin the convention. a. hamilton. washington hamilton. philadelphia, 10th july, 1787. dear sir: i thank you your communication the 3d. when i refer you the state the councils which prevailed at the period you left this city, add that they are now, if possible, a worse train than ever; you will find little ground which the hope a good establishment can be formed. a word, i _almost_ despair seeing a favorable issue the proceedings the convention, do, therefore, repent having any agency the business. the men who oppose a strong energetic government are my opinion narrow-minded politicians, are under the influence local views. the apprehension expressed them, that the _people_ will not accede the form proposed, is the _ostensible_, not the _real_, cause the opposition; admitting that the _present_ sentiment is as they prognosticate, the question ought nevertheless be, is it is it not the best form? if the former, recommend it, it will assuredly obtain, maugre opposition. i am sorry you went away; i wish you were back. the crisis is equally important alarming, no opposition under such circumstances should discourage exertions, till the signature is fixed. i will not at this time trouble you more than my best wishes sincere regards. i am, dear sir, your obedient servant, g. washington. alexander hamilton, esq. hamilton ---- new-york, ----, 1787. dear sir: agreeably what passed between us, i have had an interview mr. auldjo, i flatter myself if there is (as i doubt not there will be) as much moderation the part major peirce as there appears be that mr. auldjo, that the affair between them may yet be amicably terminated. mr. auldjo observes, i confess my opinion propriety, that he ought know some precision the matters which have given offence major peirce, before he can enter into explanations; which he declares himself be very ready do coolness candor, the moment he shall be enabled do it a specification the subjects complaint. if a personal interview is any reason disagreeable major peirce, i entreat you, my dear sir, obtain him, communicate me letter, the substance what has occasioned his dissatisfaction, so much particularity only as will put it the power mr. auldjo give an explicit answer. major peirce will, i hope, have no scruples about this, as the door explanation has been opened mr. auldjo, there is no punctilio which stands his way; i trust he will feel the force a sentiment which prudence humanity equally dictate, that extremities ought then only ensue when, after a fair experiment, accommodation has been found impracticable. an attention this principle interests the characters both the gentlemen concerned, them our own; every other consideration, as well as that personal friendship the parties, i sincerely wish give it its full operation. i am convinced you are not less anxious effect this than myself; i trust our joint endeavors will not prove unsuccessful. i remain sincere regard, dear sir, your obedient servant, alex. hamilton. i cannot, however, conclude without making one remark. though mr. auldjo has expressed still entertains a desire explanation, it would ill become him solicit it. whatever, therefore, my expressions may seem urge such an explanation the earnestness entreaty, must be ascribed my own feelings, that inclination which every man sensibility must feel, not see extremities take place if it be his power prevent them, until they become an absolutely necessary sacrifice public opinion. i remain sincere regard, dear sir, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. hamilton auldjo. new-york, july 26, 1787. sir: i have delivered the paper you committed me, as it stood altered, major peirce, whose conduct i am conclude the affair between you is at an end. he informs me that he is shortly set out a jaunt up the north river. as you intimate a wish have my sentiments writing the transaction, i shall pleasure declare that the steps you have taken consequence mr. peirceâs challenge have been altogether conformity my opinion what would be prudent, proper, honorable your part. they seem have satisfied mr. peirceâs scruples arising what he apprehended some particulars have been your conduct him, i presume we are hear nothing further the matter. i remain great esteem, sir, your obedient humble servant, alex. hamilton. mr. auldjo. hamilton to rufus king. new-york, august 20, 1787. dear sir: since my arrival here, i have written to my colleagues, informing them if either them would come down, i would accompany him to philadelphia; so much the sake propriety public opinion. the mean time, if any material alteration should happen to be made the plan now before the convention, i will be obliged to you a communication it. i will also be obliged to you to let me know when your conclusion is at hand, i would choose to be present at that time. hamilton to wadsworth. august 20, 1787. my dear sir: the inclosed is said to be the copy a letter circulating your state. the history its appearance among us is, that it was sent one _whitmore_ stratford, formerly the paymaster generalâs office, to one james reynolds this city. i am at a loss clearly to understand its object, have some suspicion, that it has been fabricated to excite jealousy against the convention, a view to an opposition to their recommendations. at all events, i wish, if possible, to trace its source, send it to you that purpose. whitmore must course say he got it, pursuing the information we may at last come at the author. let me know the political connections this man, the complexion the people most active the circulation the letter. be so good as to attend to this inquiry somewhat particularly, as i have different reasons some moment setting it foot. i remain, &c. a. hamilton. to jeremiah wadsworth. col. wadsworth to hamilton. hartford, august 26, 1787. my dear sir: i received your favor this day, the inclosed copy a letter, said to be circulating this state. some time since a paragraph the new haven papers hinted at such a letter, appeared to be written to secure the anti-federal party alarm them. i believed it was well intended, as it seemed to be meant to prepare them to comply the doings the convention, lest worse befell them; the close the letter appears to be calculated other purposes. wetmore has always associated men who wished well to america, a good government. he is half-brother to the spirited federal writer our papers, who signs himself cato; if he has really written circulated the letter question, i am quite at a loss to know his intentions. i have communicated this matter to col. humphreys, confidence, who is his way to new haven, wetmore lives, though formerly hartford. he will inquire carefully into the matter, write you. he has lived the same town wetmore, can easily fathom him. wetmore is naturally sanguine, has some talents, i believe, is enterprising, fickle. who the active people this business are, i have yet to learn, as it certainly has not circulated hereabouts. humphreys you may expect to know all that is true, wetmoreâs neighborhood. i have always been humphreysâ friend, a nearer acquaintance him convinces me he is a man great integrity, such talents as would wear well any employment confidence. if he comes to new-york i wish you to be more acquainted him. i am, dear sir, your very humble servant, jerh. wadsworth. hamilton to rufus king. new-york, august 28, 1787. dear sir: i wrote you, some days since, to request you to inform me when there was a prospect your finishing, as i intended to be you, certain reasons, before the conclusion. it is whispered here, that some late changes your scheme have taken place, which give it a higher tone. is this the case? i leave town to-day to attend a circuit a neighboring county, which i shall return the last the week, shall be glad to find a line you, explanatory the period the probable termination your business. colonel humphreys to hamilton. new haven, sept. 16, 1787. my dear sir: our friend col. wadsworth has communicated to me a letter, which you made inquiries respecting a political letter that has lately circulated this state. i arrived this town yesterday, have since conversed several intelligent persons the subject. it appears to have been printed a fairfield paper as long ago as the 25th july. i have not been able to trace it to its source. mr. wetmore informs me, that when he first saw this letter it was the hands one jared mansfield, who, i believe, has formerly been reputed a loyalist. indeed it seems to have been received circulated avidity that class people, whether it was fabricated them not. i think, however, there is little doubt that it was manufactured this state. i demanded mr. wetmore what he thought were the wishes objects the writer that letter. he said, he believed it might be written principally the amusement the author, perhaps some view to learn whether the people were not absolutely indifferent to all government dead to all political sentiment. before i saw the letter question, a paragraph had been published mr. meigs, giving an account it, attempting to excite the apprehensions the anti-federalists, an idea, that the most disastrous consequences are to be expected, unless we shall accept the proceedings the convention. some think this was the real design the fictitious performance, others, more reason, that it was intended to feel the public pulse, to discover whether the public mind would be startled propositions royalty. the quondam tories have undoubtedly conceived hopes a future union great britain, the inefficacy our government, the tumults which prevailed massachusetts during the last winter. i saw a letter, written at that period, a clergyman considerable reputation nova scotia, to a person eminence this state, stating the impossibility our being happy under our present constitution, proposing (now we could think argue calmly all the consequences) that the efforts the moderate, the virtuous, the brave, should be exerted to effect a reunion the parent state. he mentioned, among other things, how instrumental the cincinnati might be, how much it would redound to their emolument. it seems, a conversation i have had here, that the ultimate practicability introducing the bishop osnaburgh is not a novel idea among those who were formerly termed loyalists. ever since the peace it has been occasionally talked wished for. yesterday, i dined, half jest--half earnest--he was given as the first toast. i leave you now, my dear friend, to reflect how ripe we are the most mad ruinous project that can be suggested, especially when, addition to this view, we take into consideration how thoroughly the patriotic part the community--the friends an efficient government, are discouraged the present system, irritated at the popular demagogues who are determined to keep themselves office, at the risk every thing. thence apprehensions are formed, that though the measures proposed the convention, may not be equal to the wishes the most enlightened virtuous, yet that they will be too high-toned to be adopted our popular assemblies. should that happen, our political ship will be left afloat a sea chance, without a rudder as well as without a pilot. i am happy to see you have (some you) had the honest boldness to attack a public paper, the anti-federal dogmas a great personage your state. go prosper. were the men talents honesty, throughout the continent, properly combined into one phalanx, i am confident they would be competent to hew their way through all opposition. were there no little jealousies, bickerings unworthy sinister views, to divert them their object, they might perseverance, establish a government calculated to promote the happiness mankind, to make the revolution a blessing instead a curse. i think it is probable that i shall soon go to the southward; the mean time, i beg you to be persuaded that i am, sentiments sincere friendship esteem, my dear hamilton, your most obedient most humble servât, d. humphreys. col. hamilton. hamilton to washington. 1787. dear sir: you probably saw, some time since, some animadversions certain expressions governor clinton, respecting the convention. you may have seen a piece, signed âa republican,â attempting to bring the fact into question, endeavoring to controvert the conclusions drawn it, if true. my answer you will find the inclosed. i trouble you it merely that anxiety, which is natural to every man, to have his veracity at least stand a fair light. the matter seems to be given up the governor, the fact, the inferences it, stand against him full force, operate as they ought to do. it is, however, some importance to the party to diminish whatever credit influence i may possess, to effect this, they stick at nothing. among many contemptible artifices practised them, they have had recourse to an insinuation, that i _palmed_ myself upon you, that you _dismissed_ me your family. this i confess hurts my feelings, if it obtains credit, will require a contradiction. you, sir, will undoubtedly recollect the manner which i came into your family, went out it; know how destitute foundation such insinuations are. my confidence your justice will not permit me to doubt your readiness to put the matter its true light your answer to this letter. it cannot be my wish to give any complexion to the affair which might excite the least scruple you; i confess it would mortify me to lie under the imputation, either having obtruded myself into the family a general, having been turned out it. the new constitution is as popular this city as it is possible any thing to be, the prospect thus far is favorable to it throughout the state. there is no saying what turn things may take when the full flood official influence is let loose against it. this is to be expected; though the governor has not publicly declared himself, his particular connections confidential friends are loud against it. mrs. hamilton joins respectful compliments to mrs. washington. i remain perfect esteem, your excellencyâs obedient servant, a. hamilton. la fayette to hamilton. paris, october 15, 1787. my dear hamilton: while you have been attending your most important convention, debates were also going france respecting the constitutional rights, matters that kind. grave reforms are taking place at court. the parliaments are remonstrating, our provincial assemblies begin to pop out. amidst many things that were not much to the purpose, some good principles have been laid out; and, although our affairs have a proper arrangement, the nation will not the last be the loser. the prime minister is a man candor, honesty, abilities. now the rumor war sets us a-going. not that france is wishing it, great britain ought to be satisfied an advantageous treaty commerce, the profit hers prussiaâs treachery holland. but, while i consider the madness the turks, the movements the imperial court, the folly his prussian majesty, the late catastrophe holland, the cry england war, i hardly think that the peaceful dispositions this ministry--and, they say, mr. pitt--will be able to extinguish a fire that is catching every corner europe. it would be consistent my inclination best views that america be engaged an active co-operation. as i do not think it consistent her interest, i have taken the liberty to express my ideas an official letter to mr. jay, to whom i refer you. it seems to me, that a friendly, helping neutrality, would be useful to france, profitable to the united states, perfectly safe the footing the treaties. should america be forced to war, i wish it would be the last campaign--time enough to occupy canada newfoundland. i see no inconvenience privateering french letters marque. inclosed is the journal a preliminary assembly auvergne. i am returning there as soon as we have done some arrangements respecting american commerce, which will result as good footing this kingdom as it is the moment possible. the ministry are more favorably disposed. i hope you will be satisfied count de maurice the countess de brehan, his sister-in-law. i beg leave to introduce them both to you mrs. hamilton, to whom i offer my most affectionate regards. remember me to the rest the family all friends. my best compliments wait gen. schuyler the doctor. adieu, my good friend. the post is going to town. i have only time to tell that i am ever your most affectionate friend, la fayette. washington to hamilton. mount vernon, october 18, 1787. dear sir: your favor, without date, came to my hand the last post. it is unfeigned concern i perceive that a political dispute has arisen between gov. clinton yourself. both you i have the highest esteem regard. as you say it is insinuated some your political adversaries, may obtain credit, âthat you _palmed_ yourself upon me was _dismissed_ my family,â call upon me to do you justice a recital the facts; i do, therefore, explicitly declare, that both charges are entirely unfounded. respect to the first, i have no cause to believe that you took a single step to accomplish, had the most distant idea receiving an appointment my family till you were invited thereto. respect to the second, that your quitting it was altogether the effect your own choice. when the situation this country calls loudly unanimity vigor, it is to be lamented that gentlemen talent character should disagree their sentiments promoting the public weal; unfortunately this ever has been, more than probable ever will be, the case the affairs man. having scarcely been home since my return philadelphia, i can give little information respect to the _general_ reception the new constitution _this_ state. alexandria, however, some the adjacent counties, it has been embraced an enthusiastic warmth which i had no conception. i expect, notwithstanding, violent opposition will be given to it _some_ characters weight influence the state. mrs. washington unites me sending her best wishes mrs. hamilton yourself. i am, dear sir, your most obedient affectionate friend, g. washington. hamilton to washington. october 30, 1787. i am much obliged to your excellency the explicit manner which you contradict the insinuations mentioned my last letter. the only use i shall make your answer will be to put it into the hands a few friends. the constitution proposed has this state warm friends, warm enemies. the first impressions every where are its favor; the artillery its opponents makes some impression. the event cannot yet be foreseen. the inclosed is the first number a series papers to be written its defence. i send you also, at the request the baron de steuben, a printed pamphlet, containing the grounds an application lately made to congress. he tells me there is some reference to you, the object which he does not himself seem clearly to understand; imagines it may be your power to be service to him. there are public considerations that induce me to be somewhat anxious his success. he is fortified materials, which, europe, could not fail to establish the belief the contract he alleges. the documents service he possesses are a nature to convey an exalted idea them. the compensations he has received, though considerable, if compared those which have been received american officers, will, according to european ideas, be very scanty application to a stranger who is acknowledged to have rendered essential services. our reputation abroad is not at present too high. to dismiss an old soldier empty hungry, to seek the bounty those whom he has no claims, to complain unkind returns violated engagements, will certainly not tend to raise it. i confess, too, there is something my feelings which would incline me this case to go farther than might be strictly necessary, rather than drive a man, at the baronâs time life, who has been a faithful servant, to extremities. this is unavoidable if he does not succeed his present attempt. what he asks would, all calculations made, terminate this, an allowance his five hundred eighty guineas a year. he only wishes a recognition the contract. he knows that until affairs mend no money can be produced. i do not know how far it may be your power to do him any good; i shall be mistaken if the considerations i have mentioned do not appear to your excellency to have some weight. i remain, with great respect esteem, your excellencyâs obedient servant, a. hamilton. his excellency general washington. washington to hamilton. mount vernon, november 10, 1787. dear sir: i thank you the pamphlet, the gazette, contained your letter the 30th ult. the remaining numbers publius, i shall acknowledge myself obliged, as i am persuaded the subject will be well handled the author. the new constitution has, as the public prints will have informed you, been handed to the people this state a unanimous vote the assembly, it is not to be inferred hence that its opponents are silenced. the contrary there are many, some powerful ones--some whom, it is said, _overshooting_ the mark, have lessened their weight; be this as it may, their assiduity stands unrivalled, whilst the friends to the constitution content themselves with barely avowing their approbation it. thus stands the matter with us at present, yet my opinion is that the major voice is favorable. application has been made to me mr. secretary thompson (by order congress), a copy the report a committee, which was appointed to confer with the baron de steuben, his first arrival this country, forwarded to me mr. president laurens. this i have accordingly sent. it throws no other light the subject than such as is to be derived the disinterested conduct the baron. no terms are made him, ânor will he accept any thing with general approbation.â i have, however, my letter inclosing this report to the secretary, taken occasion to express an unequivocal wish that congress would reward the baron his services, sacrifices, merits, to his entire satisfaction. it is the only way which i could bring my sentiments before that honorable body, as it has been an established principle with me, to ask nothing it. with very great esteem regard, i am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, g. washington. hamilton to james madison, junr. new-york, april 3, 1788. i have been very delinquent, my dear sir, not thanking you your letter philadelphia. the remarks you made a certain subject are important, will be attended to. there is truly much embarrassment the case. i think, however, the principles we have talked of, are not only just, will apply to the other departments. nor will the consequences appear so disagreeable as they may seem at first sight, when we attend to the true import the rule established. the states _retain_ all the authorities they were before possessed of, not alienated the three modes pointed out; this does not include cases which are the creatures the new constitution. instance, the crime treason against the united states _immediately_ is a crime known only to the new constitution. there course _was_ no power the state constitutions to pardon that crime. there will therefore be none under the new, &c. this is something like, it seems to me, to afford the best solution the difficulty. i send you the federalist the beginning to the conclusion the commentary the executive branch. if our suspicions the author be right, he must be too much engaged to make a rapid progress in what remains. the court chancery a circuit court are now sitting. we are told that your election has succeeded, with which we all felicitate ourselves. i will thank you an account the result generally. in this state our prospects are much as you left them. a moot point which side will prevail. our friends to the northward are active. i remain, your affectionate obedient servant, a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. may 4, 1788. my dear sir: i believe i am in your debt a letter two, which is owing to my occupation in relation to the elections, &c. these are now over in this state, the result is not known. all depends upon albany, where both sides claim the victory. our doubts will not be removed till the latter end the month. i hope your expectations virginia have not diminished. respecting the first volume publius i have executed your commands. the books have been sent addressed to the care governor randolph. the second, we are informed, will be out in the course a week, an equal number shall be forwarded. inclosed is a letter, committed to my care mr. vanderkemp, which i forward with pleasure. believe me, with great attachment, yours, a. hamilton. hamilton to gouverneur morris. new-york, may 19, 1788. my dear sir: i acknowledge my delinquency in not thanking you before your obliging letter richmond. the truth is, that i have been so overwhelmed in avocations one kind another, that i have scarcely had a moment to spare to a friend. you, i trust, will be the less disposed to be inexorable, as i hope you will believe there is no one whom i have more inclination than yourself--i mean the _male_ kind. your account the situation virginia was interesting, the present appearances, as represented here, justify your conjectures. it does not, however, appear that the adoption the constitution can be considered as out doubt in that state. its conduct upon the occasion will certainly be critical importance. in this state, as far as we can judge, the elections have gone wrong. the event, however, will not certainly be known till the end the month. violence, rather than moderation, is to be looked the opposite party. obstinacy seems the prevailing trait in the character its leader. the language is, that if all the other states adopt, this is to persist in refusing the constitution. it is reduced to a certainty, that clinton has in several conversations declared the _union_ unnecessary; though i have the information through channels which do not permit a public use to be made it. we have, notwithstanding this unfavorable complexion things, two sources hope--one, the chance a ratification nine states, before we decide, the influence this upon the firmness the _followers_; the other, the probability a change sentiment in the people, auspicious to the constitution. the current has been for some time running towards it; though the whole flood official influence, accelerated a torrent falsehood, early gave the public opinion so violent a direction in a wrong channel, that it was not possible suddenly to alter its course. this is a mighty stiff simile; you know what i mean; after having started it, i did not choose to give up the chase. adieu. yours sincerely, a. hamilton. the members the convention in this city, a majority nine ten to one, will be:--john jay, robert r. livingston, richard morris, john sloss hobart, james duane, isaac rosevelt, richard harrison, nicholas low, alexander hamilton. g. morris, esq. hamilton to madison. new-york, may 19, 1788. some days since, i wrote to you, my dear sir, inclosing a letter a mr. vanderkemp, &c. i then mentioned to you that the question a majority for against the constitution, would depend upon the county albany. the later accounts that quarter, i fear much that the issue there has been against us. as clinton is truly the leader his party, is inflexibly obstinate, i count little overcoming opposition reason. our only chances will be the previous ratification nine states, which may shake the firmness his followers; a change in the sentiments the people, which have, for some time, been travelling towards the constitution, though the first impressions, made every species influence artifice, were too strong to be eradicated in time to give a decisive turn to the elections. we shall leave nothing undone to cultivate a favorable disposition in the citizens at large. the language the anti-federalists is, that if all the other states adopt, new-york ought still to hold out. i have the most direct intelligence, in a manner which forbids a public use being made it, that clinton has, in several conversations, declared his opinion the _inutility_ the union. it is an unhappy reflection, that the friends to it should, by quarrelling for straws among themselves, promote the designs its adversaries. we think here that the situation your state is critical. let me know what you now think it. i believe you meet nearly at the time we do. it will be vast importance that an exact communication should be kept up between us at that period; the moment _any decisive_ question is taken, if favorable, i request you to dispatch an express to me with pointed orders to make all possible diligence, by changing horses, &c. all expense shall be thankfully liberally paid. i executed your commands respecting the first volume the federalist. i sent forty the common copies twelve the finer ones, addressed to the care governor randolph. the printer announces the second volume in a day two, when an equal number the two kinds shall also be forwarded. he informs that the judicial department--trial by jury--bill rights, &c., is discussed in some additional papers which have not yet appeared in the gazettes. i remain, with great sincerity attachment, yours, a. hamilton. james madison. hamilton to madison. new-york, june 8, 1788. my dear sir: in my last, i think, i informed you that the elections had turned out, beyond expectation, favorable to the anti-federal party. they have a majority two-thirds in the convention, and, according to the best estimate i can form, about four-sevenths in the community. the views the leaders in this city are pretty well ascertained to be turned towards a _long_ adjournment; say, till next spring summer. their incautious ones observe, that this will give an opportunity to the state to _see how_ the government works, to act according to _circumstances_. my reasonings the fact are to this effect: the leaders the party hostile to the constitution are equally hostile to the union. they are, however, afraid to reject the constitution at once, because that step would bring matters to a crisis between this state the states which had adopted the constitution, between the parties in the state. a separation the southern district the other parts the state, it is perceived, would become the object the federalists, the neighboring states. they therefore resolve upon a long adjournment, as the safest most artful course to effect their final purpose. they suppose, that when the government gets into operation, it will be obliged to take some steps in respect to revenue, &c., which will furnish topics declamation to its enemies in the several states, will strengthen the minorities. if any considerable discontent should show itself, they will stand ready to head the opposition. if, the contrary, the thing should go smoothly, the sentiments our own people should change, they can elect to come into the union. they at all events take the chances time the chapter accidents. how far their friends in the country will go with them, i am not able to say, but, as they have always been found very obsequious, we have little reason to calculate upon an uncompliant temper in the present instance. for my own part, the more i can penetrate the views the anti-federal party in this state, the more i dread the consequences the non-adoption the constitution by any the other states--the more i fear an eventual disunion, civil war. god grant that virginia may accede. the example will have a vast influence our politics. new hampshire, all accounts give us to expect, will be an assenting state. the number the volumes the federalist which you desired, have been forwarded, as well the second as the first, to the care governor randolph. it was impossible to correct a certain error. in a former letter, i requested you to communicate to me, by express, the event any decisive question in favor the constitution, authorizing changes horses, &c., with an assurance to the person that he will be liberally paid for his diligence. a. hamilton. james madison. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 9, 1788. dear sir: the heat the weather, &c., has laid me up with a bilious attack: i am not able, therefore, to say more than a few words. no material indications have taken place since my last. the chance at present seems to be in our favor. it is possible things may take another turn. oswald philadelphia came here saturday; has closet interviews with the leaders the opposition. yours, affectionately, j. madison. alex. hamilton, esq. rufus king to hamilton. boston, june 12, 1788. dear sir: i have made an arrangement to forward by express the result the convention new hampshire to springfield, in this state, which place gen. knox has engaged a conveyance to you at poughkeepsie. those who are best informed the situation the question, in new hampshire, are positive that the decision will be such as we wish, the particular parts which i have heard, i can entertain no fear a disappointment that quarter. the accession new hampshire will present the subject to your convention in a new, indeed, an extraordinary light. i think your opponents, powerful as they may be, will be greatly perplexed, although they may outnumber you, a small majority the people the state may be their side, yet i cannot think they will have the hardiness to negative the question. you may pronounce, with the utmost confidence, that the decision our convention has proved entirely satisfactory to our people. i have made a business conversing with men from all parts the state, am completely satisfied that the constitution is highly popular; that its opponents are now very few, those few hourly diminishing. be assured that the organization the government (by _nine states_, is considered as certain), although a subject delicacy, is most earnestly desired, from the conversation both yeoman politician, i am persuaded, that the people massachusetts are sufficiently mature firm, to execute, so far as depends them, what shall be proper as good subjects the new government. farewell. yours, &c., rufus king. col. a. hamilton. pray mention to knox that i should have written to him had i not supposed him his way here. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 16, 1788. dear sir: yours the 8th has just come to hand. i mentioned in my last that oswald had been here in consultation with the anti-federal leaders. the contents your letter confirm the idea that a requisition for delay is foot between the opposition here with you. we have conjectured for some days, that the policy is to spin out the session, in order to receive overtures from your convention; or, if that cannot be, to weary the members into an adjournment, without taking any decision. it is presumed, at the same time, that they do not despair carrying the point previous amendments, which is preferable game. the parties continue to be nearly balanced. if we have a majority at all, it does not exceed three four. if we lose it, kentucke will be the cause; they are generally, if not unanimously against us. i have been partially recovered since my last, to-day have a sort relapse. my health is not good, the business is wearisome beyond expression. i wish you every happiness, am yours, j. madison, jr. h. lee to hamilton. 1788. my dear sir: god bless you your efforts to save me from the manifold ---- misfortunes which have continue to oppress me, whenever i attempt to aid human nature. you will do what you think best, whatever you do i will confirm. * * * * has acted the part a decided rascal, if i fail in my right, i may not in personal revenge. our convention is in full debate the great business the federal constitution. we possess, as yet, in defiance great overtures, a majority, very small indeed. a correspondence has certainly been opened through a mr. o. philadelphia, from the malcontents p. n. y. to us. it has its operation, i believe we are still safe, unless the question adjournment be introduced, love home may induce some our friends to abandon their principles. adieu, h. lee. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 20, 1788. dear sir: our debates have advanced as far as the judiciary department, against which a great effort is making. the appellate cognizance fact, an extension the power to causes between citizens different states, with some lesser objections, are the topics chiefly dwelt on. the retrospection to cases antecedent to the constitution, such as british debts, an apprehended revival the fairfax, indiana, vandalia, &c., claims, are also brought into view in all the terrific colors which imagination can give them. a few days more will probably produce a decision, though it is surmised, that something is expected from your convention in consequence the mission formerly suggested to you. delay an adjournment will be tried, if the adverse party find their numbers inferior, can prevail themselves to remain here till the other side can be wearied into that mode relieving themselves. at present, it is calculated, that we still retain a majority three four; if we can weather the storm against the part under consideration, i shall hold the danger to be pretty well over. there is nevertheless a very disagreeable uncertainty in the case; the more so, as there is a possibility that our present strength may be miscalculated. yours, affectionately, j. madison, jr. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, june, 1788. dear sir: your letter the 20th came to hand two days since. i regret that your prospects are not yet reduced to greater certainty. there is more more reason to believe that our conduct will be influenced by yours. our discussions have not yet travelled beyond the power taxation. to-day we shall probably quit this ground to pass to another. our arguments confound, do not convince. some the leaders, however, appear to be convinced by _circumstances_, to be desirous a retreat. this does not apply to the chief, who wishes to establish clintonism the basis anti-federalism. i remain affectionately yours, a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, june 21, 1788. yesterday, my dear sir, the convention made a house. that day this have been spent in preliminary arrangements. to-morrow, we go into a committee the whole the constitution. there is every appearance that a full discussion will take place, which will keep us together at least a fortnight. it is not easy to conjecture what will be the result. our adversaries greatly outnumber us. the leaders gave indications a pretty desperate disposition in private conversations previous to the meeting; i imagine the minor partisans have their scruples, an air moderation is now assumed. so far the thing is not despaired of. a happy issue with you must have considerable influence upon us. i have time to add nothing more than the assurances my sincere attachment. a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, june 21, 1788. my dear sir: i thank you for your letter the 9th instant, am glad to learn that you think the chance is in your favor. i hope no disagreeable change may appear. yet, i own i fear something from your indisposition. our debate here began the clause respecting the proportion representation, &c., which has taken up two days. to-morrow, i imagine, we shall talk about the power over elections. the only good information i can give you is, that we shall be some time together, take the chance events. the object the party at present is undoubtedly conditional amendments. what effect events may have cannot precisely be foreseen. i believe the adoption by new hampshire is certain. yours, affectionately, a. hamilton. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 22, 1788. dear sir: the judiciary department has been the anvil for several days, i presume will still be a further subject disquisition. the attacks on it have apparently made less impression than was feared. they may be secretly felt by particular interests that could not make the acknowledgment, we choose to ground their vote against the constitution in other motives. in the course this week we hope for a close the business in some form other. the opponents will probably bring forward a bill rights, with sundry other amendments, as conditions ratification. should these fail, be despaired of, an adjournment will, i think, be attempted. in case disappointment here also, some predict a secession. i do not myself concur in the last apprehension, though i have thought it prudent to withhold, by a studied fairness in every step on the side the constitution, every pretext for rash experiments. the plan meditated by the friends the constitution is to preface the ratification with some plain general truths that cannot affect the validity the act, to subjoin a recommendation, which may hold up amendments as objects to be pursued in the constitutional mode. these expedients are rendered prudent by the nice balance numbers, the scruples entertained by some who are in general well affected. whether they will secure us a majority, i dare not positively to declare. our calculations promise us success by three four, possibly five six votes. were there no possibility mistaking the opinions some, in reviewing those so many, the smallness the majority suggests the danger from ordinary casualties, which may vary the result. it unluckily happens that our legislature, which meets at this place to-morrow, consists a considerable majority anti-federal members. this is another circumstance that ought to check our confidence. as individuals they may have some influence; and, as coming immediately from the people at large, they can give any color they please to the popular sentiments at this moment, may in that mode throw a bias on the representatives the people in convention. yours, affectionately, j. madison, jr. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, friday morning, june 27, 1788. a day two ago, general schuyler, at my request, sent forward to you an express with an account the adoption the constitution by new hampshire. we eagerly wait for further intelligence from you, as our chance success depends upon you. there are some slight symptoms relaxation in some the leaders, which authorizes a gleam hope, if you do well, certainly i think not otherwise. a. hamilton. to hon. james madison, jr. madison to hamilton. richmond, june 27, 1788. my dear sir: this day put an end to the existence our convention. the inclosed is a copy the act ratification. it has been followed by a number recommendatory alterations, many them highly objectionable. one the most so is an article prohibiting direct taxes where effectual laws shall be passed by the states for the purpose. it was impossible to prevent this error. the minority will sign an address to the people. the genius it is unknown to me. it is announced as an exhortation to acquiesce in the result the convention. notwithstanding the fair propositions made by some, i am so uncharitable as to suspect, that the ill-will to the constitution will produce every peaceable effort to disgrace destroy it. mr. henry declared, previous to the final question, that although he should submit as a quiet citizen, he should wait with impatience for the favorable moment regaining, in a _constitutional way_, the lost liberties his country. my conjecture is, that exertions will be made to engage two-thirds the legislatures in the task regularly undermining the government. this hint may not be unworthy your attention. yours, affectionately, j. madison, jr. madison to hamilton. june 31, 1788. inclosed is the final result our conventional deliberations. the intended address the minority proved to be a nature apprehended by me. it was rejected by the party themselves, when proposed to them, produced an auspicious conclusion to the business. as i shall set out in a few days for new-york, i postpone further explanations. i have this instant the communications from new hampshire via poughkeepsie; also, your two favors the 19th 20th. yours, affectionately, j. madison, jr. hamilton to madison. july 8, 1788. my dear sir: i felicitate you sincerely on the event in virginia, my satisfaction will be allayed if i discover too much facility in the business amendment-making. i fear the system will be wounded in some its vital parts by too general a concurrence in some very injudicious recommendations. i allude more particularly to the power taxation. the more i consider _requisition_ in any shape, the more i am out humor with it. we yesterday passed through the constitution. to-day some definitive proposition is to be brought forward, what we are at a loss to judge. we have good reason to believe that our opponents are not agreed, this affords some ground hope. different things are thought of--_conditions precedent_, previous amendments; _conditions subsequent_, the proposition amendments, upon condition that if they are not adopted within a limited time, the state shall be at liberty to _withdraw_ from the union; lastly, _recommendatory amendments_. in either case, _constructive declarations_ will be carried as far as possible. we will go as far as we can in the latter without invalidating the act, will concur in rational recommendations. the rest for our opponents. we are informed there has been a disturbance in the city albany, on the 4th july, which has occasioned bloodshed. the anti-federalists were the aggressors, the federalists the victors. thus stand our accounts at present. we trust, however, the matter has passed over, tranquillity been restored. yours, affectionately, a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, saturday, july, 1788. i thank you, my dear sir, for yours by the post. yesterday, i communicated to duer our situation, which i presume he will have communicated to you. it remains exactly the same. no further question having been taken, i fear the footing i mentioned to duer is the best upon which it can be placed; every thing possible will yet be attempted to bring the party from that stand to an unqualified ratification. let me know your idea upon the possibility our being received on that plan. you will understand that the only qualification will be the _reservation_ a right to recede, in case our amendments have not been decided upon in one the modes pointed out by the constitution within a certain number years, perhaps five seven. if this can in the first instance be admitted as a ratification, i do not fear any further consequences. congress will, i presume, recommend certain amendments to render the _structure_ the government more secure. this will satisfy the more considerate honest opposers the constitution, with the aid them will break up the party. yours, affectionately, a. hamilton. madison to hamilton. new-york, sunday evening. my dear sir: yours, yesterday, is this instant come to hand, i have a few minutes to answer it. i am sorry that your situation obliges you to listen to propositions the nature you describe. my opinion is, that a reservation a right to withdraw, if amendments be not decided on under the form the constitution within a certain time, is a _conditional_ ratification; that it does not make new-york a member the new union, consequently that she could not be received on that plan. compacts must be reciprocal--this principle would not in such a case be preserved. the constitution requires an adoption _in toto_ _for ever_. it has been so adopted by the other states. an adoption for a limited time would be as defective as an adoption some the articles only. in short, any _condition_ whatever must vitiate the ratification. what the new congress, by virtue the power to admit new states, may be _able_ disposed to do in such case, i do not inquire, as i suppose that is not the material point at present. i have not a moment to add more than my fervent wishes for your success happiness. the idea reserving a right to withdraw was started at richmond, considered as a conditional ratification, which was itself abandoned as worse than a rejection. yours, james madison, jr. chipman to hamilton. tinmouth, july 14, 1788. sir: your character as a federalist has induced me, although, personally unknown to you, to address you on a subject very great importance to the state vermont, which i am a citizen, from which i think may be derived a considerable advantage to the federal cause. ten states have now adopted the new federal plan government. that it will now succeed is beyond a doubt; what disputes the other states may occasion i know not. the people this state, could certain obstacles be removed, i believe, might be induced almost unanimously to throw themselves into the federal scale. you are not unacquainted with the situation a considerable part our landed property. many grants were formerly made by the government new-york, lands within this territory while under that jurisdiction. on the assumption government by the people this state, the same lands, partly, it is said, for want information respecting the true situation these grants, partly from the opinion prevailing with our then leaders, that the new-york grants within this territory were no validity, have been granted to others under the authority this state. it is now generally believed that, should we be received into the union, the new-york grants would, in the federal courts, be preferred to those vermont. the legislature this state have in some instances made a compensation to the grantees under new-york, i am persuaded, were it in their power, would gladly do the same for others, they are possessed no more land for that purpose. for these reasons, i presume no others, the governor some few gentlemen deeply interested in those lands under vermont, have expressed themselves somewhat bitterly against the new federal plan government. indeed, were we to be admitted unconditionally it would introduce much confusion. now, sir, permit me to ask whether you do not think it probable that the federal legislature, when formed, might, on our accession, be induced on some terms to make a compensation to the new-york grantees out their western land? whether those grantees might not be induced to accept such compensation? let me further suggest whether it might be favorable for vermont to make some those amendments, which have been proposed by several states, which, i think, are generally within the power the federal legislature, the basis her admission. could the difficulties i have mentioned be removed, all interest in opposition could here be reconciled. the idea procuring justice to be done those whom we had perhaps injured by our too precipitate measures, being connected with a government which promises to be efficient, permanent, honorable, would, i am persuaded, produce the greatest unanimity on the subject. if you think these matters worthy the attention the friends the confederacy, be good enough to write me by my brother, who will be the bearer this. our legislature will meet in october, when these matters will be taken up seriously. several gentlemen my acquaintance, who are men influence, will be members the legislature, have requested me to procure all the information in my power on this subject. any thing you may communicate to me in confidence will be sacredly attended to, which mr. kelly, who writes by the same opportunity, will give you the fullest assurance. i am, sir, with sentiments esteem, your most obedient servant, nathaniel chipman. alex. hamilton, esq. hamilton to chipman. poughkeepsie, july 22, 1788. sir: your brother delivered me your favor, which i received with pleasure, as the basis a correspondence that may be productive public good. the accession vermont to the confederacy is, doubtless, an object great importance to the whole; it appears to me that this is the favorable moment for effecting it upon the best terms for all concerned. besides more general reasons, there are circumstances the moment which will forward a proper arrangement. one the first subjects deliberation with the new congress will be the independence kentucky, for which the southern states will be anxious. the northern will be glad to send a counterpoise in vermont. these mutual interests inclinations will facilitate a proper result. i see nothing that can stand in your way the interfering claims under the grants new-york. as to taxation, the natural operation the new system will place you exactly where you might wish to be. the public debt, as far as it can prudently be provided for, will be by the western lands the appropriation some general fund. _there will be no distribution it to particular parts the community._ the fund will be sought for in indirect taxation; as for a number years, except in time war, direct taxes would be an impolitic measure. hence, as you can have no objection to your proportion contribution as consumers, you can fear nothing from the article taxation. i readily conceive that it will hardly be practicable to you to come into the union unless you are secured from claims under new-york grants. upon the whole, therefore, i think it will be expedient for you, as early as possible, to ratify the constitution, âupon condition that congress shall provide for the extinguishment all existing claims to land under grants the state new-york, which may interfere with claims under the grants the state vermont.â you will do well to conform your boundary to that heretofore marked out by congress, otherwise insuperable difficulties would be likely to arise with this state. i should think it altogether unadvisable to annex any other conditions to your ratification; for there is scarcely any the amendments proposed that will not have a party opposed to it, there are several that will meet with a very strong opposition; it would, therefore, be highly inexpedient for you to embarrass your main object by any collateral difficulties. as i write in convention, i have it not in my power to enlarge. you will perceive my general ideas on the subject. i will only add, that it will be wise to lay as little impediment as possible in the way your reception into the union. a. hamilton. hamilton to madison. poughkeepsie, july 22, 1788. my dear sir: i wrote to you by the last post, since which nothing material has turned up here. we are debating on amendments without having decided what is to be done with them. there is so great a diversity in the views our opponents that it is impossible to predict any thing. upon the whole, however, our fears diminish. yours affectionately, a. hamilton. james madison, jr., new-york. hamilton to samuel broome. new-york, aug. 6, 1788. my dear sir: i have this moment received your letter the thirteenth ultimo, am sorry that the rules propriety in respect to my situation, as a member congress, will not permit my acting in the capacity you wish. my situation for some time past has prevented my acknowledging one two your favors, which have been duly handed to me. i recollect that one them contains an inquiry concerning your son, to which you will naturally desire an answer. my public avocations, for some time past, have put it out my power to ascertain the progress he has made; though i expect, when i shall be enough disengaged to examine, to find it a good one. it cannot fail to be so, if his diligence has been equal to his capacity. i shall shortly write you further on the subject. with great esteem, i remain, sir, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. mr. samuel broome. hamilton to washington. new-york, august 18, 1788. sir: captain cochran the british navy has requested my aid in recovering a family watch in the possession ----. in compliance with his request, i have written the letter herewith (to ---- ----), which i take the liberty to convey through you, in hope that if you see no impropriety in it, you would add your influence to the endeavor to gratify captain cochran. it is one those things in which the affections are apt to be interested beyond the value the object, in which one naturally feels an inclination to oblige. i have delivered to mr. madison, to be forwarded to you, a set the papers under the signature publius, neatly enough bound to be honored with a place in your library. i presume you have understood that the writers these papers are chiefly mr. madison myself, with some aid from mr. jay. i take it for granted, sir, you have concluded to comply with what will no doubt be the general call your country in relation to the new government. you will permit me to say that it is indispensable you should lend yourself to its first operations. it is little purpose to have _introduced_ a system, if the weightiest influence is not given to its firm _establishment_ in the outset. i remain with the greatest esteem, your obedient humble servant, a. hamilton. general washington. hamilton to governor livingston. new-york, august 29, 1788. dear sir: we are informed here, that there is some probability that your legislature will instruct your delegates to vote for philadelphia as the place the meeting the first congress under the new government. i presume this information can hardly be well founded, as upon my calculations, there is not a state in the union so much interested in having the temporary residence at new-york, as new jersey. as between philadelphia new-york, i am mistaken if a greater proportion your state will not be benefited by having the seat government at the latter than the former place. if at the latter, too, its exposed eccentric position will necessitate the early establishment a permanent seat, in passing south, it is highly probable the government would light upon the delaware in new jersey. the northern states do not wish to increase pennsylvania, by an accession all the wealth population the federal city. pennsylvania, herself, when not seduced by _immediate possession_, will be glad to concur in a situation on the jersey side the delaware. here are at once a majority the states; place the government once down in pennsylvania, pennsylvania will, course, hold fast; the state delaware will do the same. all the states south, looking forward to the time, when the balance population will enable them to carry the government further south (say to the potomac), being accommodated in the mean time as well as they wish, will concur in no change. the government, from the delay, will take root in philadelphia, jersey will lose all prospect the federal city within her limits. these appear to me calculations so obvious, that i cannot persuade myself new jersey will so much _oversee_ her interest as to fall, in the present instance, into the snares pennsylvania. with the sincerest respect regard, i remain, dear sir, your obedient servant, a. hamilton. chipman to hamilton. newfane, sept. 6, 1788. sir: i have received by capt. ville, your favor the 22d july. since i wrote you, i have had an opportunity conversing with his excellency, the governor, most the council, on the subject vermontâs accession to the confederacy. they generally agree, that the terms suggested are good; that it will be highly the interest vermont to accede; that the present is likely to be a favorable crisis. it is a question whether we ought to make any propositions to the present congress, prepare matters, wait the new arrangement. vermont will not make a point introducing any amendments. we shall not be the first to feel the inconveniences, if any should arise, from the exercise the new federal powers. for myself, i readily conceive, that direct taxation, under the new system, will be very inconsiderable during the continuance peace; yet i find an exemption from the expenses the late war will have with the citizens this state a very powerful effect in producing unanimity on the subject a union. i hope this matter will in some way be compromised. if, sir, you have any thing to suggest on this subject, that may promote the public good, i should be very happy in the communication, previous to the session assembly in october next. the choice representatives, which was on tuesday last, has, as far as i have heard, succeeded favorably. mr. kelly, who is so obliging as to take charge this letter, will be able to give you a more particular account than can be done in this way, as he has conversed largely with the governor, council, other persons influence, with whom he has great weight. i am, sir, with much esteem respect, your most obedient servant, nathl. chipman. a. hamilton, esq. hamilton to washington. new-york, september, 1788. dear sir: your excellencyâs friendly obliging letter the 28th ultimo, came safely to hand. i thank you for your assurance seconding my application to general ----. the truth that affair is, that he purchased the watch for a trifle a british soldier, who plundered major cochran, at the moment his fall, at yorktown. i should be deeply pained, my dear sir, if your scruples in regard to a certain station, should be matured into a resolution to decline it; though i am neither surprised at their existence, nor can i agree in opinion, that the caution you observe, in deferring an ultimate determination, is prudent. i have, however, reflected maturely on the subject, have come to a conclusion (in which i feel no hesitation), that every public personal consideration will demand from you an acquiescence in what will _certainly_ be the unanimous wish your country. the absolute retreat which you meditated at the close the late war was natural, proper. had the government produced by the revolution, gone on in a _tolerable_ train, it would have been most advisable to have persisted in that retreat. i am clearly opinion, that the crisis which brought you again into public view, left you no alternative to comply; i am equally clear in the opinion, that you are by that act _pledged_ to take a part in the execution the government. i am not less convinced, that the impression this necessity your filling the station in question, is so universal, that you run no risk any uncandid imputation by submitting to it. even if this were not the case, a regard to your own reputation, as well as to the public good, calls upon you in the strongest manner, to run that risk. it cannot be considered as a compliment to say, that on your acceptance the office president, the success the new government, in its commencement, may materially depend. your agency influence will be not less important in preserving it from the future attacks its enemies, than they have been in recommending it in the first instance, to the adoption the people. independent all considerations drawn from this source, the point light in which you stand at home abroad, will make an infinite difference in the respectability with which the government will begin its operations, in the alternative your being not being at the head it. i forbear to urge considerations which might have a more personal application. what i have said will suffice for the inferences i mean to draw. first. in a matter so essential to the well-being society, as the prosperity a newly instituted government, a citizen so much consequence as yourself to its success, has no option to lend his services if called for. permit me to say, it would be inglorious, in such a situation, not to hazard the glory, however great, which he might have previously acquired. secondly. your signature to the proposed system, pledges your judgment for its being such an one as, upon the whole, was worthy the public approbation. if it should miscarry (as men commonly decide from success, the want it), the blame will, in all probability, be laid on the system itself; the framers it will have to encounter the disrepute having brought about a revolution in government, without substituting any thing that was worthy the effort. they pulled down one utopia, it will be said, to build up another. this view the subject, if i mistake not, my dear sir, will suggest to your mind greater hazard to that fame, which must be ought to be dear to you, in refusing your future aid to the system, than in affording it. i will only add, that in my estimate the matter, that aid is indispensable. i have taken the liberty to express these sentiments, to lay before you my view the subject. i doubt not the considerations mentioned, have fully occurred to you, i trust they will finally produce in your mind the same result which exists in mine. i flatter myself, the frankness with which i have delivered myself will not be displeasing to you. it has been prompted by motives which you would not disapprove. i remain, my dear sir, with the sincerest respect regard, your obedient humble servant, a. hamilton. steuben to hamilton. le 5 de sept. 1788. monsieur, la lettre cây joint de mr. r. peters, contienne une preuve, non Ã©quivoque, que dans mes premiÃ¨res applications et immÃ©diatement aprÃ¨s la paix, jâai appuyÃ© mes prÃ©tentions aux e. u. sur une stipulation ou contract fait en entrant dans leur service. comme vous Ã©tiez de cette mÃªme committÃ©e Ã  philadelphie, je mâen rapporte Ã  votre mÃ©moire. dans tous les committÃ©es subsÃ©quentes jâai toujours appuyÃ© sur ce mÃªme contract, et je me rapporte Ã  tous les messieurs qui successivement furent des committÃ©es sur ce sujet. comme vous Ã©tes de la presente congrÃ¨s, je vous prie de communiquer la reporte de mr. peters Ã  cette committÃ©e. jâai lâhonneur dâÃ¨tre avec affection, monsieur, votre trÃ¨s humble, steuben. alexander hamilton. hamilton to theodore sedgewick. new-york, oct. 9, 1788. your last letter one met me at albany attending court, whence i am just returned. i am sorry for the schism you hint at among the federalists, i have so much confidence in the good management the fast friends the constitution, that i hope no ill consequences will ensue from that disagreement. it will, however, be worthy great care to avoid suffering a difference opinion on collateral points, to produce any serious division between those who have hitherto drawn together on the great national question. permit me to add, that i do not think you should allow any line to be run between those who wish to trust alterations to future experience, those who are desirous them at the present juncture. the rage for amendments is, in my opinion, rather to be parried by address than encountered with open force; i should therefore be loth to learn that your parties had been arrayed professedly upon the distinction i have mentioned. the mode in which amendments may best be made, twenty other matters, may come as pretexts for avoiding the evil, securing the good. yours, a. hamilton. hamilton to chipman. 1788. sir: your favor the 6th september has been duly handed to me, i receive great pleasure from the hopes you appear to entertain a favorable turn affairs in vermont in regard to the new government. it is certainly an object mutual importance to yourselves, to the union, well deserves the best endeavors every discerning good man. i observe with satisfaction your opinion that vermont will not make a point introducing amendments. i mean as a condition her accession. that ground would be the most hazardous which she could venture upon, as it is very probable that such amendments as might be popular with you would be deemed inadmissible by the friends the system, who will doubtless be the most influential persons in the national councils; who would rather submit to the inconvenience your being out the union, till circumstances should alter, than consent to any thing that might impair the energy the government. the article taxation is, above all, the most delicate thing to meddle with; for as _plenary_ power in that respect must ever be considered as the vital principle government, no abridgment constitutional suspension that power can ever, upon mature consideration, be countenanced by the intelligent friends an effective national government. you must, as i remarked in my former letter, rely upon the natural course things, which i am satisfied will exempt you in ordinary times from direct taxation, on account the difficulty exercising it in so extensive a country, so peculiarly situated, with advantage to the revenue satisfaction to the people. though this difficulty will be gradually diminished from various causes, a considerable time must first elapse; and, in the interim, you will have nothing to apprehend on this score. as far as indirect taxation is concerned, it will be impossible to exempt you from sharing in the burthen, nor can it be desired by your citizens. i repeat these ideas to impress you the more strongly with my sense the danger touching this chord, the impolicy perplexing the main object with any such collateral experiments, while i am glad to perceive that you do not think your people will be tenacious on the point. it will be useless for you to have any view in your act to the present congress. they can course do nothing in the matter. all you will have to do, will be to pass an act accession to the new constitution, on the conditions upon which you mean to rely. it will then be for the new government, when met, to declare whether you can be received on your terms not. i am sorry to find that the affair boundary is likely to create some embarrassment. menâs minds, every where out your state, are made up upon reconciled to that which has been delineated by congress. any departure from it must beget new discussions, in which all the passions will have their usual scope, may occasion greater impediments than the real importance the thing would justify. if, however, the further claims you state cannot be gotten over with you, i would still wish to see the experiment made, though with this clog, because i have it very much at heart that you should become a member the confederacy. it is, however, not to be inferred that the same disposition will actuate every body. in this state, the pride certain individuals has too long triumphed over the public interest; in several the southern states a jealousy northern influence will prevent any great zeal for increasing in the national councils the number northern votes. i mention these circumstances (though i dare say they will have occurred to you), to show you the necessity moderation caution on your part, the error any sanguine calculation upon a disposition to receive you at any rate. a supposition this nature might lead to fatal mistakes. in the event an extension your boundary beyond the congressional line, would it be impracticable for you to have commissioners appointed to adjust any differences which might arise? i presume the principal object with you in the extension your boundary would be to cover some private interests. this might be matter negotiation. there is one thing which i think it proper to mention to you, about which i have some doubt; that is, whether a legislative accession would be deemed valid. it is the policy the system to lay its foundations in the _immediate_ consent the people. you will best judge how far it is safe practicable to have recourse to a convention. whatever you do, no time ought to be lost. the present moment is undoubtedly critically favorable. let it by all means be improved. i remain, with esteem, sir, your obedient humble servant, a. hamilton. nathaniel chipman, esq. washington to hamilton. mount vernon, october 3, 1788. dear sir: in acknowledging the receipt your candid friendly letter ---- by the last post, little more is incumbent on me than to thank you sincerely for the frankness with which you communicated your sentiments; to assure you that the same manly tone intercourse will always be more than barely welcome. indeed, it will be highly acceptable to me. i am particularly glad, in the present instance, you have dealt thus freely like a friend. although i could not help observing from several publications letters, that my name had been sometimes spoken of, that it was possible the _contingency_ which is the subject your letter might happen; yet i thought it best to maintain a guarded silence to back the _counsel_ my best friends (which i certainly hold in the highest estimation), rather than to hazard an imputation unfriendly to the delicacy my feelings. for, situated as i am, i could hardly bring the question into the slightest discussion, ask an opinion, even in the most confidential manner, without betraying, in my judgment, some impropriety conduct, without feeling an apprehension that a premature display anxiety might be construed into a vain-glorious desire pushing myself into notice as a candidate. now, if i am not grossly deceived in myself, i should unfeignedly rejoice in case the electors, by giving their votes in favor some other person, would save me from the disagreeable dilemma being forced to accept refuse. if that may not be, i am in the next place earnestly desirous searching out the truth, knowing whether there does not exist a probability that the government would be just as happily effectually carried into execution without my aid as with it. i am _truly_ solicitous to obtain all the previous information, which the circumstances will afford, to determine (when the determination can with propriety be no longer postponed) according to the principles right reason the dictates a clear conscience, without too great a reference to the unforeseen consequences which may affect my person reputation. until that period, i may fairly hold myself open to conviction, though i allow your sentiments to have weight in them; i shall not pass by your arguments without giving them as dispassionate a consideration as i can possibly bestow on them. in taking a survey the subject in whatever point light i have been able to place it, i will not suppress the acknowledgment, my dear sir, that i have always felt a kind gloom upon my mind as often as i have been taught to expect i might, perhaps must, ere long be called to make a decision. you will, i am well assured, believe the assertion (though i have little expectation it would gain credit from those who are less acquainted with me), that if i should receive act under the appointment, the acceptance would be attended with more diffidence reluctance than ever i experienced before in my life. it would be, however, with a fixed sole determination lending whatever assistance might be in my power to promote the public weal, in hopes that, at a convenient an early period, my services might be dispensed with, that i might be permitted once more to retire, to pass an unclouded evening after the stormy day life, in the bosom domestic tranquillity. why these anticipations? if the friends the constitution conceive that my administering the government will be the means its acceleration strength, is it not probable that the adversaries thereof may entertain the same ideas, course make it an object opposition? that many this description will be amongst the electors, i have no more doubt than i have the part they will act at the election, which will be adverse to the choice any character who, from whatever cause, would be likely to thwart their views. it might be impolitic perhaps in them to make this declaration _previous_ to the election, i shall be out in my conjectures if they do not act conformably thereto at it, prove that all the _seeming_ moderation by which their present conduct is marked, is calculated to lull deceive. their plan opposition is systematized, a regular intercourse between the leaders it in the several states (i have much reason to believe) is formed to render it more effectual. with sentiments sincere regard esteem, i am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, george washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. hamilton to theodore sedgewick. new-york, october 9, 1788. i thank you, my dear sir, for your obliging congratulations on the event towards effecting which your aid as a joint laborer was so essential. i hope experience may show that, while it promotes the interest this place, it will not be incompatible with public good. we are making efforts to prepare handsome accommodations for the session the new congress. on the subject vice-president, my ideas have concurred with yours, i believe mr. adams will have the votes this state. he will certainly, i think, be preferred to the other gentleman. yet _certainly_ is perhaps too strong a word. i can conceive that the other, who is supposed to be a more pliable man, may command anti-federal influence. the only hesitation in my mind with regard to mr. adams has arisen within a day two, from a suggestion by a particular gentleman that he is unfriendly in his sentiments to general washington. richard h. lee, who will probably, as rumor now runs, come from virginia, is also in this style. the lees adamsâs have been in the habit uniting, hence may spring up a cabal very embarrassing to the executive, course to the administration the government. consider this,--sound the reality it, let me hear from you. what think you lincoln knox? this is a flying thought. yours, with sincere regard, a. hamilton. mr. sedgewick. sedgewick to hamilton. stockbridge, oct. 16, 1788. my dear sir: your favor the 9th i have this moment received, detain the post a while that i may make a very few observations on a subject i conceive highly interesting to the efficient operations the future government. mr. adams was formerly infinitely more democratical than at present, possessing that jealousy which always accompanied such a character, he was averse to repose such unlimited confidence in the commander-in-chief as then was the disposition congress. mr. adams is not among the number my particular friends, but, as a man unconquerable intrepidity, incorruptible integrity, as greatly experienced in the interests character this country, he possesses my highest esteem. his writings show that he deserves the confidence those who wish energy in government, for although those writings are too tedious unpleasant in perusal, yet they are evidently the result deep reflection, as they encounter popular prejudices are an evidence an erect independent spirit. lincoln knox i love, their characters, too, i respect, it is now too late to push in this state the interests either. the minds all men here seem to be fixed either on adams hancock. our legislature meet on the 29th. from boston i will early write you on the subject, am with sincere respect, yours, affectionately, theodore sedgewick. hon. mr. hamilton. sedgewick to hamilton. boston, nov. 2, 1788. my dear sir: in my last hasty letter i engaged to write to you soon after my arrival in this town. various questions will be agitated in the legislature (of considerable magnitude) which respect the organization the government. there is a party federalists who are opinion, that the electors should be chosen by the people, the representatives not in districts, at large. these will be joined by all the antis probably. i yet hope they will not succeed. we yesterday committed to a committee both houses the circular letter from your convention. the event is uncertain, a considerable number federalists have been brought over to the amendment system. the prospect is, notwithstanding, that the real friends the constitution will prevail. every thing depends upon it, the exertion will be proportionate to the magnitude the object. should the electors be chosen by the legislature, mr. adams will probably combine all the votes massachusetts. i am very certain, that the suggestion that he is unfriendly to general washington, is entirely unfounded. mr. hancock has been very explicit in patronizing the doctrine amendment. the other gentleman is for postponing the conduct that business until it shall be understood from experience. * * * * i am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, theodore sedgewick. the hon. mr. hamilton. col. olney to hamilton. providence, 3d nov., 1788. dear sir: your favor 6th ulto., was duly received. i thought proper to postpone replying to it till after the session the general assembly should be over, which terminated on saturday night last, in order that i might have it in my power to give you, with more certainty, the proceedings the legislature, on the subject the new constitution. the minority, both in the house, took unwearied pains during the session, to procure a convention in the legal mode pointed out for considering the new constitution; but, sir, it proved, as heretofore, an unsuccessful attempt; for mr. hazard, who is an implacable powerful enemy to the new system, the leading character in all the vile politics carrying on in this _devoted_ state, had so well prepared the majority, that when the question was put, whether this state should appoint a convention not, the question was lost nearly three to one; fifteen in favor the motion forty-four against it. after which (late on saturday night) mr. hazard moved that a vote be passed, for printing copies the circular letter from the convention new-york, to be distributed throughout this state, submitting to the people at large, the propriety appointing delegates to meet a _proposed_ convention, for considering amendments, agreeably to the recommendations said circular letter. the vote being put, after much debate, it was carried in favor the measure by three to one, notwithstanding every exertion the minority, to prevent the adoption so novel unprecedented a proceeding. it was urged, with truth, that should a convention finally meet for the purpose amending the constitution, that it would be composed entirely the adopting states; and, as such, this state could not, upon any principles right, expect to be admitted to a seat in that honorable body, as we so obstinately (and with our eyes open) have refused, still neglect to accede to the new system. but, sir, reason argument will avail nothing with those wicked designing opposers to a just honorable federal government. the assembly have made an adjournment to the last monday in december next, in an expectation to hear the report from the respective towns. mr. hazard, a col. john gardener (who is entirely under the influence mr. hazardâs politics), are ordered by the assembly to go on from this state, take their seats in congress, as soon as they can leave home; so that in a short time you will have those two antis to deal with. i am, with sincere esteem, sir, your obedient humble servât, jeremiah olney. col. alexander hamilton. washington to hamilton. mount vernon, nov. 6, 1788. dear sir: the count de moustier affording a very favorable conveyance for capt. cochranâs watch, i have requested the favor him to take charge it; he will deliver it to you, accordingly, with mrs. washingtonâs my best wishes for you mrs. hamilton. i am, dear sir, your obedient affectionate servât, g. washington. the hon. alexander hamilton. hamilton to sedgewick. new-york, nov. 9, 1788. your last letter one met me at albany, attending court, from whence i am but just returned. yours the 2d instant is this moment handed me. i am very sorry for the schism you hint at among the federalists, but i have so much confidence in the good management the fast friends the constitution, that i hope no ill consequences will ensue from that disagreement. it will, however, be worthy great care to avoid suffering a difference opinion on collateral points, to produce any serious division between those who have hitherto drawn together on the great national question. permit me to add, that i do not think you should allow any line to be run between those who wish to trust alterations to future experience, those who are desirous them at the present juncture. the rage for amendments is, in my _opinion_, rather to be parried by address than encountered with open force. i shall, therefore, be loth to learn that your parties have been arranged professedly upon the distinction i have mentioned. the _mode_ in which amendments may best be made, twenty other matters, may serve as pretexts for avoiding the evil securing the good. on the question between mr. h. mr. a., mr. king will probably have informed you that i have, upon the whole, concluded that the latter ought to be supported. my measures will be taken accordingly. i had but one scruple, but after mature consideration i have relinquished it. mr. adams, to a sound understanding, has always appeared to me to add an ardent love for the public good; as his further knowledge of the world seems to have corrected those jealousies which he is represented to have been once influenced by, i trust nothing of the kind suggested in my former letter will disturb the harmony of administration. let me continue to hear from you, believe me to be, with very great esteem regard, your friend servant, a. hamilton. t. sedgewick, esq. hamilton to washington. november 18, 1788. dear sir: your last two letters have duly come to hand, the count de moustier has delivered me the watch you committed to his charge. your obliging attention to this matter claims my particular acknowledgments. i will make no apology for asking you to take the additional trouble of forwarding the inclosed to the general. i take the liberty of passing it through you, that you may, by perusing the contents, know the situation of the business. the demand of fifty guineas is to me quite unexpected. i am sorry to add, that there is too good evidence that it cost a mere trifle to the general. this, however, i mention in confidence. nor shall i give you any further trouble on the subject. whatever may be proper will be done. mrs. hamilton requests her affectionate remembrances to mrs. washington, joins me in the best wishes for you both. i remain, dear sir, your affectionate humble servât, a. hamilton. p. s. your last letter, on a certain subject, i have received. i feel a conviction that you will finally see your acceptance to be indispensable. it is no compliment to say, that no other man can sufficiently unite the public opinion, can give the requisite weight to the office, in the commencement of the government. these considerations appear to me of themselves decisive. i am not sure that your refusal would not throw every thing into confusion. i am sure that it would have the worst effect imaginable. indeed, as i hinted in a former letter, i think circumstances leave no option. hamilton to madison. new-york, nov. 23, 1788. i thank you, my dear sir, for yours of the 20th. the only part of it which surprises me, is what you mention respecting clinton. i cannot, however, believe that the plan will succeed. nor, indeed, do i think, that clinton would be disposed to exchange his present appointment for that office, risk his popularity by holding both. at the same time, the attempt merits attention, ought not to be neglected as chimerical impracticable. in massachusetts the electors will, i understand, be appointed by the legislature, will be all federal, âtis probable will be, for the most part, in favor of adams. it is said, the same thing will happen in new hampshire, i have reason to believe, will be the case in connecticut. in this state it is difficult to form any certain calculation. a large majority of the _assembly_ was doubtless of an anti-federal complexion, but the schism in the party which has been occasioned by the falling off of some of its leaders in the convention, leaves me not without hope, that if matters are well managed, we may procure a majority for some pretty equal compromise. in the senate we have the superiority by one. in new jersey there seems to be no question, but that the complexion of the electors will be federal; i suppose, if thought expedient, they may be united in favor of adams. pennsylvania you can best judge of. from delaware, maryland, south carolina, i presume, we may count with tolerable assurance on federal men; i should imagine, if pains are taken, the danger of an anti-federal vice-president might itself be rendered the instrument of union. at any rate, their weight will not be thrown into the scale of clinton, i do not see from what quarter numbers can be marshalled in his favor, equal to those who will advocate adams, supposing even a division in the federal votes. on the whole, i have concluded to support adams, though i am not without apprehensions on the score we have conversed about. my principal reasons are these: first--he is a declared partisan of deferring to future experience the expediency of amendments in the system, (although i do not altogether _adopt_ this sentiment) it is much nearer my own than certain other doctrines. secondly--he is certainly a character of importance in the eastern states; if he is not vice-president, one of two worse things will be likely to happen. either he must be nominated to some important office, for which he is less proper, will become a malcontent, give additional weight to the opposition to the government. as to knox, i cannot persuade myself that he will incline to the appointment. he must _sacrifice_ emolument by it, which must be of _necessity_ a primary object with him. if it should be thought expedient to endeavor to unite in a particular character, there is a danger of a different kind to which we must not be inattentive--the possibility of rendering it doubtful who is appointed president. you know the constitution has not provided the means of distinguishing in certain cases, it would be disagreeable even to have a man treading close upon the heels of the person we wish as president. may not the malignity of the opposition be, in some instances, exhibited even against him? of all this we shall best judge, when we know who are our electors; we must, in our different circles, take our measures accordingly. i could console myself for what you mention respecting yourself, from a desire to see you in one of the executive departments, did i not perceive the representation will be defective in characters of a certain description. wilson is evidently out of the question. king tells me he does not believe he will be elected into either house. mr. gouverneur morris set out to-day for france, by way of philadelphia. if you are not in one of the branches, the government may sincerely feel the want of men who unite to zeal all the requisite qualifications for parrying the machinations of its enemies. might i advise, it would be, that you bent your course to virginia. affectionately yours, a. hamilton. mr. j. madison. washington to hamilton. monday morning, january 4, 1789. dear sir: i feel myself very much obliged by what you sent me yesterday. the letter from governor johnston i return, much pleased to find so authentic an account of the adoption by north carolina of the constitution. yours, sincerely affectionately, g. washington. hamilton to sedgewick. new-york, jan. 29, 1789. my dear sir: i thank you for your two letters of the 4th 7th instant, which arrived here during my absence at albany, from which place i have but recently returned. i believe you may be perfectly tranquil on the subject of mr. adamsâs election. it seems to be certain that all the middle states will vote for him to delaware inclusively, probably maryland. in the south, there are no candidates thought of but rutledge clinton. the latter will have the votes of virginia, it is _possible_ some in south carolina. maryland will certainly not vote for clinton, new-york, from our legislature having by their contentions let slip the day, will not vote at all. for the last circumstance, i am not sorry, as the most we could hope would be to balance accounts do no harm. the anti-federalists incline to an appointment notwithstanding, but i discourage it with the federalists. under these circumstances, i see not how any person can come near mr. adams; that is, taking it for granted that he will unite the votes in new hampshire massachusetts. i expect that the federal votes in virginia, if any, will be in favor of adams. you will probably have heard that our legislature has passed a bill for electing representatives. the houses continue to disagree about senators, i fear a compromise will be impracticable. i do not, however, entirely lose hope. in this situation, you will perceive that we have much to apprehend respecting the seat of government. the pennsylvanians are endeavoring to bring their forces early in the field. i hope our friends in the north will not be behindhand. on many accounts, indeed, it appears to be important that there be an appearance of zeal punctuality in coming forward to set the government in motion. i shall learn with infinite pleasure that you are a representative. as to me, this will not be the case--i believe, from my own disinclination to the thing. we shall, however, i flatter myself, have a couple of federalists. i remain your affectionate obedient, a. hamilton. wadsworth to hamilton. hartford, february, 1789. my dear sir: your favor of the 25th january came in good time. our votes were given agreeably to your wishes--washington, 7; adams, 5; governor huntington, 2. by letters from carrington, i learn that clinton is the anti-federal vice-president; but i think we have nothing to fear. i believe new hampshire will give adams 4; massachusetts, 6; georgia, 6--as letters from georgia say he will have at least so many--which, with ours, makes 21, which is more than clinton can get, we may certainly reckon on three more for adams in south carolina, maryland, delaware, pennsylvania, new jersey. we waived an answer to your state, to virginia. as you did not get my letter in season to answer me on that subject, i feared we should not do any good by an answer; as the anti-federalists did not move it, i thought we had best let it sleep. * * * i am, dear sir, your affectionate friend, jeremiah wadsworth. end of vol. i. transcriberâs notes a number of typographical errors were corrected
